  Mike: Greg, were you smoking cigarettes?
  Greg: No, Dad.
  Mike looks at Carol
  Mike: Well, he's lying. There's no doubt about that.
  Looks back at Greg
  Mike: Greg, I'm afraid your punishment will be four hours in the
  snakepit.
  Mike pushes a button and the floor in front of them opens up.
  Mike: Now maybe that'll give you some time to think about what you've
  done.
  Greg: Aw, man!
  Greg jumps into the snakepit
Jan: That'll teach him.
  Mike walks over to a metal door
  Mike: And Jan, I'm afraid you've earned a day in the chamber of fire...
  for tattling on your brother.
  Cuts back to the family
  Lois (sounding disgusted): Ugh, smoking. How does a boy like that go so
  wrong?
  Peter: Well, they live in a crummy neighborhood.
  Brian: The Bradys?
  Peter Aw, hell yeah. They got robbers, thugs, drug dealers. You name it.
  A woman pops up in front of the Griffins' window

  Witnesses.
  Theme Song
  Cuts to Chris, Lois, Stewie, and Meg in the kitchen
  Meg: Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections?

  Lois takes the mind-control device out of Stewie's hands.
  Stewie: Damn you, vile woman! You've impeded my work since the day I
  escaped from your wretched womb.
  Lois: Oh, don't pout, honey. You know, when you were born... the doctor
  said you were the happiest looking baby he's ever seen.
  Stewie: But, of course, that was my victory day. The fruition of my
  deeply-laid plans... to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille!
  Return the device, woman!
  Lois: No toys, Stewie.
  Lois takes the mind-control device away from Stewie and places it in a
  cupboard.
  Stewie: Very well, then. Mark my words: when you least expect it, you
  uppance will come!
  [suspenseful instrumental music]

  Meg: Come on. This thing goes up to 90.
  Meg turns up the heat for the thermostat up to 65 degrees
  Peter bursts into the kitchen
  Peter: Who touched the thermostat?
  Meg: God, how does he always know?

  children are messing with the dial.

  pants on. What's the occasion?
  Lois: He's going to a stag party.
  Peter: Now Lois, I work hard all week to provide for this family. I am
  the man of the house. And as the man, I order you to give me permission
  to go to this party.
  Lois: Look, at least promise me you won't drink. Alcohol always leads
  to trouble.
  Peter: Come on. You're worrying about nothing.
  Lois: Oh? Remember when you got drunk off the Communion wine at church?
  Cuts away to a priest giving a sermon
  Priest: And so the Lord God smote poor Job... with festering boils all
  over his body.
  God: Oh man, I hate it when he tells this story.
  Shows Peter taking a sip of wine while the priest is talking in the
  background.
  Priest: Yet, miraculously, Job was still able to retain his dignity.
  Peter: ***coughs*** Whoa, is that really the blood of Christ?
  Priest: Yes.
  Peter: Man, that guy must have been wasted 24 hours a day.
  Cut scene ends
  Lois: And then there was that time at the ice cream store.
  Cuts to an ice cream shop where Peter is staring at his ice cream cone.

  Philadelphia?
  Cuts away to everyone in a movie theatre
  [Audience crying]

  Tom Hanks' character: I have AIDS.
  Peter: ***laughing hysterically*** ta ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
  Cut scene ends
  Lois: Promise me, Peter.

  Peter: Oh, I'm going for the high score.
  Quagmire: Well actually, Charlie's got the high score.
  Shows a drunk guy taking a leak in the grandfather clock
  Charlie: Hey, man. Your clock won't flush.
  Goes back to Peter talking with his friends
  Peter: Heh. You know, I feel kind of bad, you guys. I promised my wife
  I wouldn't drink.
  Quagmire: Oh, don't feel bad, Peter.
  Peter: Oh, gee. I never thought of it like that.
  Random Perv: Hey, did you bring the porno?
  Peter: Did I bring the porno huh?
  Peter pulls out a movie labeled "Assablanca".
  Peter: You're gonna love it. It's a classic.
  Shows the guys watching the movie on the couch
  On the movie:
  Rick: Listen to me, Ilsa. If I take this thing out... and you're not on
  it, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But soon,
  and for the rest of your life.
  Cuts back to the guys
  Peter: Oh, come on, Ilsa! Get on!

  Charlie: What is this?
  Peter: Oh, man. My kid must've taped over this for history class.
  [Groans]
  Random Perv: The Statue of Liberty? What are we gonna do?
  Peter: Boys, boys, we're gonna drink until she's hot.

  Chris: Yeah. A new family record. Way to raise the bar, dad.
  Lois: Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that.
  Peter: Now kids, Daddy only drank so the Statue of Liberty would take
  her clothes off.
  Lois: Peter, what did you promise me last night?
  Peter: That I wouldn't drink at the stag party.
  Lois: And what did you do?
  Peter: Drank at the stag... oh ***laughs*** I almost walked right into
  that one. Oh, God!
  Peter puts his hands up to his head.
  Peter: It feels like there's accountants are cranking adding machines
  in my head.
  Cuts to inside Peter's head with two accountants.
  [Machines whirring]
  Paul: Dick, you ever wonder what's outside those walls?
  Dick: Say now, that's dangerous thinking, Paul. You best stick to your
  work.
  Paul: ***quick laugh*** Okay.
  Cuts back to Peter on the table.
  Lois: You see, Peter? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was
  right. I mean...
  Lois's chair breaks and she falls to the ground.
  Meg: Mom, are you all right?
  Lois: My goodness. This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly? I
  could've broken my neck.
  Stewie: Damn!
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Peter: Look, honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I
  wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened.
  Lois: Well, I... I guess you're right.
  Peter: Apology accepted. All right, I'm going to work. Somebody's gotta
  put food on this table.
  Peter falls off the table, making all the food on top of him also fall
  off the table.

  [Snoring]
  Mr. Weed: Peter!
  Peter: What?!
  Mr. Weed: Are you sleeping on the job?
  Peter: ***staggering*** No. There's a bug in my eye and I'm trying to
  suffocate him.
  Mr. Weed: Peter, I like you. But I need you to be more than just eye
  candy around here. It's your job to watch for any toys that could be
  hazardous to children. Now look sharp!
  Peter: Yes, sir!
  Mr. Weed walks away and Peter falls back asleep.
  [Snoring]
  Knives, gasoline, and razors start passing by Peter in the assembly
  line.
  Cuts to the Quahog 5 news
  Diane Simmons: And now Back to Action 5 News. Our top story tonight,
  "When Toys Attack." Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.

  Cuts to the Griffin house.
  [Sad instrumental music]
  Meg: Oh my God! You got fired?
  Chris: Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine!
  Stewie: How do you know about the machine?
  Peter: Now don't worry, kids. Your father's still gonna put food on
  this table. Just not as much. So it might get a little competitive.
  Meg: Who cares about food? Now we'll never be able to afford my lip
  injections!
  Brian: Hey, uh, Peter, can we put her out in the yard for a while?
  Lois: Okay, who's hungry?
  Peter: Oh, jeez. How the hell am I gonna break this to Lois? If she
  finds out I got fired for drinking, she's gonna blame me!
  A small devil of Peter pops up on Peter's right shoulder.
  Peter's Devil: Lie to her. It's okay to lie to women. They're not
  people like us.
  Peter: Oh, I don't know.
  Peter looks to his left shoulder.
  Peter: Hey, where's the other guy?
  Cuts to a traffic jam in the sky.
  Peter's Angel: Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work.
  The angel starts drinking his coffee and spills it everywhere on his
  chest.
  Peter's Angel: Oh, this perfect!
  Cuts back to Peter talking to the kids.
  Peter: Look, I don't want your mom to worry, all right? When she
  worries, she says, "I told you so" and, "Stop doing that. I'm asleep."
  So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay? Now, not a word to your mom
  about me getting canned.
  Lois: What's that, Peter?
  Peter: Uh, nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.
  Lois: What?
  Peter: Uh, Meg, honey, can you pass the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?
  Lois: Peter, are you feeling okay?
  Peter: I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world.
  Lois: All right, then let's eat. Now I know you all hate eggplant, but--
  A laser shoots past Lois's head.
  Lois: What on earth was that?
  The family looks at Stewie, who's holding a sandwhich with a gun
  sticking out of it.
  Stewie: What the deuce are you staring at? It's tuna fish... and
  nothing else.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]

  at that restaurant.
  Cuts to Peter in a security uniform standing next to the salad bar.
  It shows an old lady about to sneeze.
  Old Lady: aaa-- aaa-- aaa--

  Emcee: And the prize goes to The von Trapp Family Singers!
  Shows Peter in a Bavarian outfit, holding a tuba.
  Peter: That is bull--
  [Loud applause]
  Cuts back to Peter talking to Brian.
  Brian: Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent, but you might want to
  just tell Lois the truth.
  Peter: What? That I can't provide for my family? That she's always
  right? That I didn't really stand up to that tank in Tiananmen Square?
  Cuts to three tanks rolling down Tainanmen Square.
  Shows a chinese man pushing his hand forward in a signal to stop the
  tanks, with Peter nervously standing next to him.
  Peter: Aw, screw this! I just came over to buy some fireworks!

  or later, she'll find out where you're really going every day.
  Peter: Oh, yeah.
  Cuts to Lois watching TV and Peter standing in the corner like a lamp
  with lamp shade over his head.

  [Mellow instrumental music]
  Stewie launches himself to the cupboard with the grapnel and grabs the
  mind-control device.
  Stewie: Victory is mine!
  The rope breaks and Stewie falls on the floor
  Stewie: Aahh!
  Lois: Peter, I'll need the checkbook in the morning. I'm going to Stop
  'N Shop for some sweet corn.
  Lois walks into the kitchen and turns on the light.
  Peter: You're spending money on food again? Lois, we just had dinner.
  Lois: Well you know, I enjoyed it so much, I thought we'd eat again
  tomorrow. Since when are you so concerned about our food budget?
  Peter: Well, I just... Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but...
  Lois: What is it, Peter?
  Peter: I... uh... you're getting kind of fat.
  Lois: What?
  Peter: It's just... It's not healthy.
  Lois: Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape three times a week. When
  was the last time you saw your toes?
  Peter: Gee, man, I thought you people were supposed to be jolly.
  Lois: Peter, what the hell is the matter with you? Honey, you know, if
  there's something wrong, you can tell me.
  Peter's angel pops up on his left shoulder.
  Peter's Angel: Hey uh, sorry man. Am I late. What did I miss?
  Peter: Thank God you're here. What do I do?
  A devil pops up on the angel's right shoulder.
  Peter's Angel's Devil: Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep.
  Peter's Angel: Oh, I don't know.
  Peter's angel looks to his left shoulder.
  Peter's Angel: Hey, where's the other guy?
  Cuts to Peter's Angel's angel stuck in traffic.
  Peter's Angel's Angel: Ah, this is unbelievable!
  Cuts back to Peter talking to Lois.
  Peter: Lois, I promise you, everything's fine. You got nothing to worry
  about.
  Stewie: Well, well, mother! We meet again!
  Stewie aims the mind control device at Lois.
  Lois: Stewie, I thought I tucked you an hour ago.
  Stewie: Not tightly enough it would seem. And now you contempible
  harpy, I shall end your oppressive reign of matriarchal tyranny.
  Lois: You can play with your toys tomorrow, honey. Right now it's
  bedtime.
  Lois puts the mind-control device back into the cupboard and picks up
  Stewie.
  Stewie: Oh, blast you and your estrogenical treachery!
  Peter: Sweet dreams, kiddo.
  Stewie: You have the power to end this!
  Brian walks in and sits down with Peter at the kitchen table.
  Brian: Hey, how'd she take it?
  Peter: I told her she was fat.
  Brian takes his newspaper and smacks Peter over the face with it.
  Brian: No.
  Brian smack Peter again with the newspaper.
  Brian: No.
  Peter: Look, I hate lying to Lois. It's just... It's the best way to
  keep her from knowing the truth.
  Brian: Peter, you don't have a choice. Your unemployment is going to
  dry up soon. And she'll probably sense something's amiss when they
  repossess your house. You really oughta think of your family's welfare.
  Peter: Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!

  Stewie (with a crossbow): Why don't you burn in hell?
  Lois: Well, no dessert for you, young man.
  Shows Peter on the the corner of the street with Brian peeing on the
  fire hydrant.
  Peter: Boy, who would've thought getting drunk at a stag party would
  get me $150,000 a week from the government?

  Peter: Hey, maybe somebody down there was drinking, too.
  Cuts to a press interview.

  Cut scene ends.
  Shows Brian talking to Peter.
  Brian: Peter, you might want to call the Welfare Commission. That check

  Chris: You're not going to believe it, Mom! Dad's getting--
  Peter: A big raise!
  Lois: Peter, that's wonderful!
  Chris: But, Dad, I thought--
  Peter: The kind of a big raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big
  allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, you guys.
  I'm going to buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had.
  Shows the family at a fast food drive thru.
  Peter: Yeah, I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please.

  checked, that's not that new.
  Shows a sign saying "Quahog Institute of Cosmetic Surgery", at the

  Meg: Thank you, Daddy!
  Meg hugs Peter while showing her new, larger lips and kisses him on the
  cheek.

  Chris: These are cool.
  Shows Lois in the front of the house doing yardwork behind a stream of
  water.
  Mailwoman: When did you guys get a pool?
  Lois: Oh, it's a moat. I know it's silly, but my husband thinks our

  Mailwoman: Does it work?
  Lois: Well, it does keep the Black Knight at bay.
  Shows the Black Knight at the other side of the moat.

  Lois gives back an angry stare.
  Peter: What?
  Shows Peter, Brian, and Lois in their expensive living room.
  Peter: Lois, I know what I did was wrong. But I only did it for you and
  the kids. Except for the jukebox in the bathroom. That was a gift for
  Peter.
  Lois: Yeah, from the American taxpayers. I am so mad I can't see
  straight.
  Peter: Oh, no problem. We got the money to get that fixed... with
  enough left over for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids
  might get into. Just like the Kennedy's.
  Lois: You know, I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter. The
  man I marries would never think he could fix a problem just by spending
  money!
  Peter: Boy, she's pretty pissed.
  Brian: Yeah, who would have thought welfare fraud would be one of her
  buttons?
  Peter: What's the point in having a jukebox in the john if your wife's
  mad at you?
  Brian: Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers.
  Peter: Yeah, but I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it. I need an
  event with thousands of people. Something that everybody cares about.
  Peter thinks for a moment.
  Peter: We might have to leave Rhode Island for this one.
  Cuts to a football stadium.
  John Madden: The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight!
  Pat, I think it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to

  John: Yeah, I know. I'm just making conversation. Come on. ***waves his
  hands in Pat's face*** Football!
  Shows a blimp flying over the stadium which says "Forgive me Lois".
  Brian (in the blimp): Amazing. You can barely drive a car. And yet you
  were allowed to fly a blimp?
  Peter (flying the blimp): Yeah, America's great, isn't it? Except for
  the South.
  Peter grabs a huge sack of money.
  Peter: Oh boy, I hope Lois is watching. Ok, taxpayer, here you go!
  Peter begins throwing all of the money out of the blimp, into the
  stadium.
  Pat: Looks like we're getting some rain here tonight, John.
  John: Yeah. Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain! It's some
  kind of crazy money rain!
  Pat: I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp.
  Goes back to Peter and Brian.'
  Peter: Oh, man. I hope this works. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start

  ever seen anything like this, Pat? Pat?
  Pat runs back to his chair with wads of cash sticking out of his jacket.
  Pat: Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl. This is the old "trying to make
  amends for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds"
  play.
  John: I don't care what it is! This guy's ruining a perfectly good game
  of football! Madden to Fox Security.
  Fox Security: Go ahead.
  John: Take them down!
  Fox Security: Yes, sir.
  One of the guards takes a gun hanging from the wall, under a sign that

  Shows Peter and Brian in a prison cell.
  Brian: How was your shower?
  Peter: Oh, I tell you Brian, all of the rumors about dropping the soap
  are true.
  Brian: Really?
  Peter: Oh yeah, you can't hold onto that thing to save your life. It
  was slipping all over the place. Guys were laughing.
  Prisoner #1: Hey, there's the guy that couldn't hold onto the soap.
  'Prisoner #2: Oh, that was classic.
  Both prisoners start laughing.
  Peter: Oh boy, I really let Lois down this time. Do you think she'll
  wait for me?
  Brian: Oh come one, if every woman dumped her husband just for crashing
  a blimp into the Super Bowl, no one would be married.
  Peter: Yeah, you're right. Okay, I got the top bunk.
  Peter jumps onto the top bunk of the bed, forcing the top bunk to fall
  onto Brian.
  Shows the rest of the family in the kitchen.
  Meg: Oh, the rest of my collagen is wearing off.
  Lois: Well honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you
  shouldn't have covered for your father's lie.
  Chris: What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears?
  Lois: It means you're becoming a man. But hopefully not the kind who
  stayed out all day and doesn't call... like your father who shall
  remain nameless.
  Stewie: Hello, Mother.
  Lois: Well hi there, sweetie.
  Stewie: You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates.
  Stewie pulls out a box.
  Stewie: You never know what you're going to get. Your life, however, is
  more like a box of active grenades!
  Stewie opens the box, revealing 6 grenades.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Stewie: Now, I offer you one last chance for deliverance. Return my
  mind-control device or be destroyed.
  Lois: Oh, you just want your toy back. Okay, here you go, honey.
  Lois places the mind-control device on the box of grenades.
  Stewie: Yes... Well, victory is mine!
  Stewie runs into the living room and the grenades blow up on him.
  Stewie: Ah, damn you all!
  [Phone ringing]
  Lois picks up the kitchen phone.
  Lois: Hello? Oh, my God!
  Shows Peter's family walking into the courthouse and sitting down.
  Peter: Lois, ah man, am I glad to see you.
  Lois: I have nothing to say to you, Peter.
  Peter: I gave the money back. Why are you still steamed?
  Lois: Peter, you lied to me, you betrayed my trust. Compared to that,
  welfare fraud doesn't even matter.
  Peter: Really? Aw, let's hope the judge feels that way.
  Lois: Ugh.
  Judge: This court will come to order.
  The judge bangs his gavel and it shows Peter up on the stand.
  Peter: Well, you know, I figured the sooner I cashed the check, the
  sooner they'd catch their mistake. Look, why are we making a federal
  case out of this?
  Judge: Mr. Griffin, don't you think you should have alerted the
  government of such a gross overpayment?
  Peter: Well, I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of
  "Different Strokes" was on. You know, the one where Arnold and Dudley
  get sexually molested by the guy who owns the bike shop?
  Cuts to a bike shop with an old guy bent over in front of Arnold and
  Dudley.
  Bike Shop Owner: All right. Now I want you boys to scream real loud at
  my ass.
  Cut scene ends
  Goes back to Peter on the stand.
  Peter: And everybody learns a valuable lesson.
  Judge: Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson?
  Peter: Oh yeah. Stay the hell away from that bike shop.
  [People murmuring]
  Peter: Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did. I just... I
  don't know. I just saw one chance I'd ever have to give my family the
  things they deserve. I guess I screwed it up. I cheated the government.
  And worst of all, I lied to my wife. And she deserves better. I'm
  sorry, honey.
  Judge: Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm
  sentencing you to 24 months in prison.
  The judge bangs his gavel.
  Lois: Oh, no!
  Brian: Oh, no!
  Chris: Oh, no!
  Meg: Oh, no!
  Kool Aid Man bursts through the wall.
  [Rock music]
  Kool Aid Man: Oh, yeah!
  Everyone stares blankly at Kool Aid Man.
  [Rock music stops abruptly]
  Kool Aid Man slowly walks out through the hole he created in the wall.
  Lois: Excuse me, Your Honor?
  Judge: Yes?
  Lois: Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times. And he may
  even be downright stupid. But I know he only accepted that money
  because he wanted to be a good husband and father. But what he needs to
  remember is that we love him. And no matter what, I'll always stand by
  him.
  Peter: I love you too, honey.
  Judge: That was very moving Mrs. Griffin. Okay, you can go to jail with
  him!
  Lois: What?
  Stewie: 24 months in prison? Unacceptable! Intolerable as it may be,
  I'm completely dependant upon those wretched drones for sustenance. Let
  us see how the constitution of American justice fares against against
  the device!
  Stewie pulls out his mind-control device and points it straight in the
  judge's direction.
  [Device pulsates]
  Judge: Is that your boy?
  Peter: What? Oh uh, yeah. That's Stewie.
  Judge: Gosh. I can't seperate a kid that young from his father. It's
  unjudgemently. Aw hell, you've learned your lesson, right?
  Peter: Yeah.
  Judge: All right. You're off the hook.
  Peter: Oh, wow! Can you give me my job back?
  Judge: No.
  Stewie points the mind-control device at the judge.
  Judge: Yes.
  Peter: All right!
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Shows everyone in the living room watching "Bloopers".
  [Man laughing on TV]
  Cuts to the TV:
  Ed: That was a crazy one, Dick.
  Dick: It sure was, Ed. In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi,
  watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: "She sells seashells
  down by the seashore."
  Bloopers shows clip from "Joanie Loves Chachi".
  Erin: What does your mom do for a living?
  Scott: She sells seashells down by the--
  A bear jumps through the wall and attacks Scott Baio.
  Cut scene ends.
  Peter: That is kind of a tongue twister.
  Lois: It's good to have you home Peter.
  Peter: Ah, honey, I knew everything would turn out okay.
  Meg: I sure am gonna miss being rich.
  Peter: Oh, don't worry. I got a way to get money.
  Brian: Not another welfare scam?
  Peter: No, no, no. Minority scholorship.
  Peter puts on an afro wig.
  [Giggles]
  The frame freezes as Peter winks while giving a thumbs up sign. The
  credits begin rolling.
  [Jazzy instrumental music]
  Lois and Brian: No.
  Stewie: Are you insane?
  Peter: Okay, I mean, uh, sexual harassment suit.
  Peter puts on a blonde wig and rips the front of his shirt.
  [Giggles]
  Brian: No.
  Lois: I don't think so.
  Stewie: Absolutely outrageous.
  Peter: Uh, okay, disability claim.
  Peter pulls out a baseball bat and hits himself over the face,
  instantly knocking himself out.
  Family Guy Credits roll




Title: I Never Met the Dead Man

[Cheery instrumental music]
  Lois: Oh, look at Stewie. Isn't he adorable playing with his Sesame
  Street phone?
  Stewie: Put me through to the Pentagon.
  Ernie: Do you know What sound a cow makes?
  Stewie: Don't toy with me, Ernie! I've already dispatched with Mr.
  Hooper, I've six armed men outside Big Bird's nest, and as for Linda?
  It's difficult for a deaf woman to hear an assassin approach, isn't it?
  Ernie: Can you count to three?
  Stewie: Indeed I can. One! Two! Three! [Shoots ray-gun] Can I count to
  three? For God's sake, I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level.
  Theme Song
  Lois: Come on, Stewie. You can't leave the table until you finish your
  vegetables.
  Stewie: Then I shall sit here until one of us expires. And you've got a
  good 40 years on me, woman!
  Lois: Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good for you. Now open up for the
  airplane. [Makes airplane noise]
  Stewie: Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you! And damn the Wright
  Brothers!
  Lois: My, aren't we fussy tonight. Okay. No broccoli.
  Stewie: Very well then. I…[broccoli shoved into mouth] Who
  the hell do you think you are?
  Lois: Honey, it's not gonna go away just because you don't like it.
  Stewie: Well, then. My goal becomes clear. The broccoli must die.
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Meg: Mom, will you take me out to practice driving?
  Lois: I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour. Maybe your father
  can take you.
  Peter: Oh, sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you. But Daddy also loves Star Trek.
  And, in all fairness, Star Trek was here first.
  Captain Kirk: Captain's log, Stardate 8169.7. The Enterprise has just
  discovered a strange new planet in the Gamma Fallopia star system. Mr.
  Sulu, ahead Warp 9.
  Lois: For God's sake, Peter. You've been in front of the TV since you
  got home from work. Why don't you spend some time with your family?
  Peter: I will, I'm just gonna do it during the commercials. And if
  that's wrong, well then maybe I'm missing the point of having
  commercials.
  Lois: [Sighs]
  Meg: Please. My road test is tomorrow and you haven't taught me
  anything.
  Brian: Meg, you may want to find a better teacher than Peter.
  Peter: What are you talking about? I'm a great driver.
  Brian: Remember your trip to the Southwest?
  Road Runner: Meep-meep!
  Peter: [Hits Road Runner] Aw, jeez. Did I just hit that ostrich?
  Wile E. Coyote: No.
  Peter: Are you sure?
  Wile E. Coyote: Yeah, he's fine. Keep going.
  Peter: Meg, don't believe what they're saying. I always keep my eyes on
  the road. I don't miss a thing.
  Announcer: We now return to Star Trek.
  Peter: Holy crap. Uhura's black?
<in car>
  Peter: All right, Meg. Now here's your first lesson. Now, you always
  want to be aware of other cars on the road. And if you ever catch eyes
  with the guy next to you at a red light, you gotta race him. Ah, this
  guy's asking for it.
  Meg: But Dad...
  Peter: I don't make the rules, honey. Now rev your engine twice.
  Meg: Okay.
  [Engine revving twice] [Horse sputtering twice]
  Peter: Go!
  [Fast-paced instrumental music]
  Amish Guy [Screaming]
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Peter: Well, you forgot to flip him off. But other than that, nice job.
  Lois: You're back already? That wasn't much of a lesson.
  Peter: Well, I didn't want to overload her on her first time out, you
  know? Besides CHiPs is about to start. So let's sit back and get lost
  in a world of California Highway Patrol fantasy!
  [Police siren] [CHiPs music]
  Woman: What's the charge, Officer?
  Erik Estrada: Driving without my phone number.
  [Gunshots firing]
  Erik Estrada: Or maybe I should arrest you for being too beautiful.
  [Teeth sparkling]
  Stewie: So, broccoli, Mother says you're very good for me. Well, I'm
  afraid I'm no good for you! The first rule of war is know thine enemy.
  And I know this! Cold kills broccoli! It's so simple. All I need to do
  is build a machine to control the global environment. Forecast for
  tomorrow: a few sprinkles of genius with a chance of doom!
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Peter: This is taking forever! Come on, Meg, let's go. Fox is running
  one of those new reality shows at 8:00: "Fast Animals, Slow Children."
  [African instrumental music]
  Boy: Come on, guys. Wait up.
  [African music continues]
  Boy: Dang. I got honey all over my legs.
  Meg: Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life depends on getting my
  license. If I can't drive, I'll never have any boyfriends, never get
  married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell.
  Peter: Meg, are you implying that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive?
  Meg: I'm so nervous.
  Peter: Aw, you're gonna do great. Just remember everything I taught you.
  Instructor: All right, let's start by going down Main Street.
  Meg: Okay.
  [Engine revving twice] [Police siren]
  Instructor: What are you doing?
  Meg: I'm driving. Duh.
  Instructor: [Screaming]
  Meg: Are you gonna mark me down for not flipping him off?
<back in Griffin car>
  Meg: Oh, God, my life is over. I am the biggest loser I know!
  Peter: I know just how you feel, pumpkin. I've had my share of
  disappointments, too.
  OB: It's a girl!
  Peter: Can you check again?
<back in Griffin car>
  Peter: Look, honey, you just have to remember that life has its little
  ups and...oh, jeez! We're gonna miss the beginning of my show. Hey,
  there it is.
  Meg: Dad, watch out!
  [Horn blaring]
  Peter: Meg, honey, are you okay?
  Meg: Yeah, I think so.
  Peter: "The Quahog Cable Television Transmitter." Uh-oh.
  [Citizens grumbling]
  Man: Hey! You just knocked out cable TV for the whole town!
  Peter: Oh Boy! Hey, look, there's Bigfoot!
  Bigfoot: Whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't about me. This is about you.
  Peter: Oh, well, at least I bought us some time. She did it.
  Meg: What? Dad, you were the one driving!
  Peter: I was teaching her to drive and she lost control of the car.
  Come on, you guys, we all did stupid stuff when we were kids, right? I
  remember when I tried to sneak into an R-rated movie. <flashback
  to Peter sneaking into a movie wearing a shrub costume; then back to
  the regular scene> Aw, come on. Give the kid a break, huh?
  Man: Why should we?
  Peter: She got her arm shot off in Vietnam.
  [Murmuring]
  Man: Poor kid.
  Man 2: What a senseless war.
  Meg: I can't believe you just sold out your own daughter.
  Peter: Now, Meg, honey, I know what I did was wrong, and I know it's
  not the first time I've embarrassed you.
  Teacher: And if you add the measure of the angles of a right triangle,
  the sum of...
  Peter: Hey, Meg, you mind cleaning out the shower next time you shave
  your legs? It's like a carpet in there.
<back in Griffin car>
  Peter: I hate to see you so upset. Hey, I know. Let's play a little
  game called Taking the Fall for Daddy. If you win, I'll buy you a
  convertible when you get your license.
  Meg: Really? Oh, Daddy! Now I love you again!
  Peter: Oh, you're gonna make some Jewish guy a great wife.
  [Metallic clanking]
  Tom Tucker: Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company, all
  television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time.
  Of course, no one can see this news program, so it doesn't really
  matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ. Think I'll go get drunk
  and beat up some midgets. How about you, Diane?
  Diane Simmons: Well, Tom, I just plain don't like black people.
  Technician: You guys, we're still on in Boston.
  Stewie: Excellent. The weather machine is nearly completed. What do you
  say to that, broccoli? Stop mocking me! What's this? It appears the
  witless provider has finally brought me something of value. I can use
  that crude device to amplify my deadly signal. Victory shall yet be
  mine.
  Meg: Guess what, Mom? Dad crashed the car into the city cable
  transmitter.
  Lois: What?
  Meg: Oh, it's okay. If I take the blame, he's going to buy me a
  convertible when I get my license.
  Peter: Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame if you go around telling
  everyone.
  Lois: Peter! You're bribing your daughter with a car?
  Peter: Come on, Lois-isn't "bribe" just another word for "love"? Look,
  you wanted me and Meg to bond. And that's what we're doing.
  Chris: Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told
  me some idiot knocked out the cable. We could be without TV for weeks!
  Peter: Now, now, Chris, now let's not panic. We can manage just fine
  without TV.
  Brian: [scoffs]
  Peter: What's that supposed to mean?
  Brian: Face it, Peter, you're addicted to television. You're not
  exactly Mr. Cold Turkey. Remember when you gave up candy?
  Willy Wonka: I'll ask you one more time. You didn't eat anything in my
  factory?
  Peter: No.
  Willy Wonka: I'm just asking...
  Peter: Are you calling me a liar?
  Willy Wonka: I'm just saying...
  Peter: Hey, shut up, Wonka.
  Peter: Yeah, well, that was different. I'll be fine.
  Lois: Are you sure, honey?
  Peter: Oh, for God's sake, you guys. You think I'm some simp who can't
  live without TV? C'mon, give me a break.
<Peter on phone>
  Peter: All right, Mike, what's happening now?
  Mike: Well, Sipowicz is trying to find out who stabbed the super.
  Detective Sipowicz: Are you gonna tell me what I want to know, or am I
  gonna have to show you my ass?
  Criminal: I ain't saying nothing! All right, it was Jimmy the Hat!
  Peter: Aw, forget it, Mike. Without actually seeing his ass, this is
  just radio.
  Teacher: Well, class, we were scheduled to watch a PBS program on the
  mating rituals of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe of New Guinea.
  Unfortunately, Megan Griffin ruined TV. So, instead, we're having a
  surprise test.
  Meg: [Wonder Years Voice] Whoa! Suddenly I was public enemy number one.
  It was time to tell the truth. [aloud] Wait! I didn't drive into the
  satellite dish!
  Teacher: Oh. And who did?
  Meg: [Wonder Years Voice] I was just a 15-year-old girl. But at that
  moment, I realized I had a whole lifetime to make new friends. But only
  one chance to get a new car. And I had to take it. [aloud] Okay, I did
  it.
  Peter: Jeez, Brian, I don't know how much longer I can last. It's been
  a whole week since I seen a TV show. I wonder what Scooby and the gang
  are up to right now.
  Narrator: We now return to The Scooby Doo Murder Files.
  Fred: Gee whiz, gang. Looks like the killer gutted the victim,
  strangled him with his own intestines and then dumped the body in the
  river!
  Velma: Jinkies! What a mystery!
  Scooby Doo: [Moaning]
  Fred: You're right, Scoob. We're dealing with one sick son of a bitch.
  Brian: Well, you just need to find something to fill the void it's left
  in your life. Lois has her knitting, Chris has his video games, Meg's
  learning how to drive. And me, I like the sauce. Hey, barkeep, whose
  leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here?
  Peter: [Moaning] Can't live without TV. Must see TV.
  [music from the tornado sequence in "The Wizard of Oz"]
  Peter: [Sighs]
  Lois: Stewie, I expect you to finish off your vegetables.
  Stewie: Oh, rest assured, you relentless harridan, I expect I shall
  finish them all off! And you as well!
  Lois: Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter. Last night I woke up and
  he was channel surfing through static.
  Brian: Oh, I'm sure he'll find a way to cope.
  Peter: Morning, Lois.
  Brian: And you were worried.
  Lois: Peter, what the hell is that?
  Peter: It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins.
  Lois: Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning to think you're losing
  your grip on reality.
  Peter: Boring. I'm gonna go see what else is on.
  Lois: Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie.
  Brian: Don't move!
  Stewie: [Making ridiculous noises] [Screams] A little help?
  Peter: Hey! It's Glen Quagmire, the wacky next-door neighbor. What's he
  up to this time?
  Quagmire: I'm going to work!
  Peter: Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes.
  Lois: We have to find your father, Chris. He's not well.
  Chris: I never knew anyone who went crazy before. Except my invisible
  friend Col. Schwartz!
  Peter: I get all the channels on this thing. Lifetime. CBS. Hey, UPN.
  All right, 90210.
  Meg: Dad?
  Peter: Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly? Oh, boy, they're really
  reaching for guest stars in the 10th season.
  Meg: Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here! I'm already a total
  outcast because of you!
  Peter: Now, honey, you're just upset because you wrecked the cable
  transmitter.
  Meg: I did not! Forget it. What good is a car if I have no friends? I
  didn't wreck TV! My dad did!
  Principal: What?
  Teacher: What'd she say?
  Groundskeeper: Peter Griffin ruined television?
  Hard-hat: And blamed his daughter?
  Parachutist: Well, that's the lowest thing I've ever heard.
  Lois: Peter, take that thing off and come home.
  Peter: Hey, Lois. You're just in time for the exciting conclusion.
  Looks like some boob's about to get lynched. Let's watch.
  Crowd: There they are.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Hard-hat: Hey, that's the guy who ruined our cable. Let's get him!
  Lois: Stop! Stop! What is wrong with you people? Okay, yes. My husband
  is responsible for knocking out TV. But we should be thanking him. He's
  broken television's hypnotic spell over us. Now we can see the world
  for what it is-a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting
  to be experienced.
  Peter: Aw, Jeez, another chick flick.
  Principal: She's right. All the hours we've wasted on that damn idiot
  box. I'm gonna paint my house!
  Parachutist: I'm gonna build a ship in a bottle.
  Old Man: I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick down a dirt road.
  Lois: I'll take you home, honey.
  Peter: I can't believe I let Meg take the blame. You were right, Lois.
  TV is evil. You know, I hear that Manson guy watches it in jail all day
  long.
  Charles Manson: If I haven't seen it, it's new to me.
  Lois: You just went a little overboard. You need a little balance in
  your life. There are other things to appreciate besides television.
  Peter: You mean like this lamp?
  Lois: Yeah. Okay. The lamp gives us light.
  Peter: I get it.
  Lois: And your family gives you love. You should spend some time with
  our kids, Peter. And with me.
  Peter: What could me and you do together?
  Lois: [Naughty laugh]
  Peter: Lois! You've got a sick mind!
  Lois: Peter, I'm talking about making love.
  Peter: Oh. Oh, I thought you wanted us to murder the children and
  harvest their organs for beer money.
  Lois: [Amorous giggling]
  Peter: What a gorgeous day. Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun?
  Sun: It's always a nice day with two scoops of raisins, Peter.
  [Car alarm blaring]
  Peter: Top of the morning, everybody.
  Stewie: Excellent! Thus completes the penultimate adjustment to my
  weather control device! Victory is...release me at once!
  Peter: Guys, your mother was right. It'd be a crime to just sit around
  and wait for the TV to start working.
  Meg: Great. So you can teach me how to drive.
  Peter: Meg, there'll be plenty of time to drive when you're dead.
  There's a big world out there just waiting for us to grab it by the
  short hairs!
  Stewie: Damn!
  Peter: Let's go.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Peter: I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing really wore me out.
  Chris: Well, wake up! You promised you'd get this hook out of my mouth.
  [Screams] Thank you.
  Lois: Now, kids, your father's just trying to spend time with his
  family. Or kill us. I'm not sure which.
  Tom Tucker: Those Chinese sure do like to spit, don't they? Well,
  Diane, that last report was so good, I think you deserve a spanking.
  Diane Simmons: Oh, Tom, I don't think your wife would appreciate that.
  Tom Tucker: Diane, that frigid old cow lives in Quahog. She can't hear
  a word I'm saying.
  Technician: Actually, we're back on the air in Quahog.
  Stewie: Thank God! Their puerile minds are once again distracted by
  that flickering box. Time to be bad!
  Peter: Come on, everyone. We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival.
  You know those Germans. You don't join their party, they'll come get
  you.
  Meg: But Dad, the TV's back on.
  Peter: Huh, what do you know? Okay, let's go.
  Lois: Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend so much time with the
  family. But we're exhausted. Maybe we could just sit and watch some TV
  together?
  Peter: We're too busy living life to the fullest. Come on, let's go.
  Lois: I'm sick of life.
  Brian: Yeah. My dogs are barking.
  Peter: But I thought we were having fun.
  Meg: We were. But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun
  or get killed. You know, whatever's on.
  Lois: Look, Peter. It's your favorite show.
  Captain Kirk: All right, men. This is a dangerous mission. And it's
  likely one of us will be killed. The landing party will consist of
  myself, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Ricky.
  Ensign Ricky: Ah, crap.
  Peter: Sorry, Lois. There's only one show I want to see. It's a little
  something I like to call "Make Every Day Count," starring Peter Griffin
  as himself.
  Lois: Oh, come on, Peter. Don't you miss TV just a little? The familiar
  stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that
  bring a character around at exactly the right moment?
  William Shatner: Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down while I was
  on my wayto give a speech on how TV keeps families together. Say, would
  you like to hear it?
  Peter: No, no, no, I don't want to miss the all-you-can-eat schnitzel
  bar.
  William Shatner: Wait a minute! I love schnitzel!
  Peter: Oh, well, come along. I bet you could squeeze into Lois'
  lederhosen.
  William Shatner: I'll change in the car.
  Meg: If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out on
  meinstead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little...
  Lois: Let's go, Meg.
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Stewie: Fare thee well, broccoli!
  [Band playing German folk music]
  William Shatner: I don't know. I can't imagine choosing life over
  television.
  Peter: I'm telling you, it's great, Bill. The only thing that would
  make this perfect day better is if my family was here.
  William Shatner: My God! It was sunny a moment ago, but now it's
  pouring!
  Peter: Hey, let's take off our shoes and run home barefoot!
  William Shatner: Griffin, you're a madman! Barefoot, you say?
  Lois: This is not safe. I'll teach you how to drive some other time.
  Pull over.
  Meg: Mom, I can't even tell where "over" is.
  William Shatner: [Giddy laughter] You were right, Peter. I've never
  felt so alive.
  Stewie: Victory is mine! [screams] God damn it.
  William Shatner: [Giddy laughter] My God.
  [Car colliding]
  Meg: Oh, my God. I hit William Shatner.
  William Shatner: Light growing dimmer. Can't breathe. Beam me up, God.
  Ensign Ricky: I did not see that coming.
  Meg: Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over and killed Mr. Shatner.
  Peter: Ah, don't worry, honey. Soon as I get out of this body cast, I'm
  gonna do enough living for me and Bill.
  Lois: Honey, can't we go back to the way things used to be? There's a
  big dent in that couch that nobody else can fill.
  Peter: Haven't you guys learned anything? TV took over my life once.
  I'm never gonna let that happen again.
  Lois: Oh, my God. We've lost him.
  Peter: Hey, if you help me out of here, I know an enchanted meadow
  where the blueberries are just begging to be picked.
  Nurse: Look, buddy. Just go in the pan, and don't call me unless you're
  flatlining.
  Peter: Hey. Hey, turn that TV off. Nurse? Nurse?
  Announcer: What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Would you stand on one
  leg?
  Man: Sure.
  Announcer: Would you act like a monkey?
  Man: Uh-huh. [makes monkey noises]
  Announcer: Would you-would you kill a man?
  Man: Uh. Uh, well...
  [Gunshot]
  Meg: Daddy, now that I've finally passed my driver's test, can I still
  get a convertible?
  Peter: No. But I'm proud of you for getting your license, sweetheart.
  Lois: And I'm proud of you, Peter. You taught us all a valuable lesson.
  It's not what you do that defines the quality of your life, it's who
  you do it with And your family...
  Peter: Shhh...It's on.
  Lois: I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie, but you'll thank me when
  you grow up big and strong like your
  father.
  Stewie: A compelling argument. You've swayed me, woman. Mmmm. Oooh,
  that is good. I feel stronger already. It's good tasting and good for
  you.
  Stewie: Nice try.
  Brian: Quadruped.
  Stewie: Mutant.
  [closing theme music]



Title: Chitty Chitty Death Bang

[Cheery instrumental music]
  
  Lois: Well, everything's all set for
  Stewie's birthday
  party. I can't believe he's almost a year old.
  
  Peter: Yeah. I'll never forget the
  day he was born.
  
  Doctor: One more push, Lois. This is
  quite a miracle, Mr.
  Griffin. Would you like to have a look?
  
  Peter: Yeah, you know, I've never
  actually seen a live baby
  being...oh, God!
  
  Doctor: Congratulations, Mrs.
  Griffin. It's a boy. Wait a
  minute. I don't think we're through here.
  
  Lois: Oh, my God! Is it twins?
  
  Doctor: No. It's a map of Europe.
  
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  
  Lois: I just confirmed everything
  with the birthday party
  planner down at Cheesie Charlie's.
  
  Peter: Why Cheesie Charlie's?
  
  Chris: Ah, it's cool, Dad! They have
  this game where you put
  in a dollar and you win four quarters! I win every time! I get to go,
  right?
  
  Peter: Why can't we have the same
  kind of party we always
  do?
  
  Lois: Peter, this could be our last
  first birthday ever. YOu
  know, when Meg and Chris turned one, I had so much to do, I missed
  everything.
  
  [younger Lois slaving in kitchen]
  
  [Kids chattering]
  
  Lois: [Sighs]
  
  Peter: Lois, you're not gonna believe
  this! Meg just said
  "Da-Da!"
  
  Lois: Her first words?
  
  Peter: Then she stood up all by
  herself and started walking!
  
  Lois: Her first steps?
  
  Peter: Yeah. What the hell are you
  doing in here anyway?
  
  [Drums playing]
  
  Peter: All right! Her first drum solo.
  
  [Applause]
  
  Lois: Well, thanks to Cheesie Charlie
  I'm not gonna miss a
  moment of Stewie's party.
  
  Stewie: I say, am I to spend the
  entire day wallowing around
  in my own feces? <clap clap> A little service here! 
  Peter: Hey, Stinky. Have we got some
  big plans for you.
  
  Stewie: Plans? What the devil are you
  talking about?
  
  Chris: It's your birthday, dude.
  
  Lois: Saturday's gonna be real
  special, honey. I've hired a
  professional to make sure everything goes just right.
  
  Stewie: A professional?
  <gasp> There's treachery
  afoot! 
  Meg: [Crying]
  
  Peter: Meg, you're home late.
  
  Meg: I stayed after school to try out
  for cheerleading.
  
  Peter: Well, don't keep me in
  suspense. How'd you do?
  
  Meg: I'll give you a hint. I
  S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked! Sucked!
  
  Peter: Yay! Oh, I mean, sorry, honey.
  
  Meg: God, I hate high school. I don't
  fit in with anyone.
  
  Peter: Oh, boy. Do I know that
  feeling.
  
  [Suspenseful, jazzy instrumental
  music]
  
  [Peter with gang, dancing]
  
  Dancer: Okay, man. Okay. You are
  really throwing me off.
  It's step-kick, step-twirl. Got it?
  
  Peter: I thought we were just gonna
  rumble with those greasy
  Sharks.
  
  Dancer: Not without seven years of
  ballet and two of jazz
  tap, we're not. From the top, people! Look, why don't you just hang
  back and
  stretch?
  
  Meg: I don't get it. The harder I try
  to make friends, the
  more people hate me.
  
  Peter: Listen. Meg, you're a
  one-of-a-kind girl with a mind
  of her own. Now, see, that's what people hate.
  
  Meg: Really?
  
  Peter: I'm telling you, just be the
  girl you think everyone
  else wants you to be.
  
  Meg: Wow, it's so obvious. Thanks,
  Daddy. Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.
  
  Lois: Well, I haven't seen Meg this
  happy since that bus
  broke down in front of our house.
  
  Taylor Hanson: Hi. Can we use your
  phone?
  
  Peter: Holy crap! It's The Children
  of the Corn!
  
  [back on front steps]
  
  Peter: Meg and I just had a little
  father-daughter talk.
  
  Lois: Well, it seems to have worked.
  
  Peter: Hey, I wasn't just blowing
  smoke when I bought this
  T-shirt ("#1 Dad"). 
  Lois: Well, you're the number-one
  husband, too.
  
  Peter: I know. That's why I bought
  this T-shirt ("No
  Fat Chicks"). Whoops. 
  Stewie: <writing in
  diary> "Dear Diary, It seems
  the domestic overseers are plotting against me. Their plans somehow
  relate to
  the anniversary of my escape from the womb. I'm still haunted by the
  memories
  of how I came to be incarcerated in that amniotic Attica. 
  [Epic instrumental music]
  
  Stewie: "As I recall, it was every
  potential man for
  himself. 
  [Whooshing]
  
  Stewie: "I alone had reached the
  target objective,
  thanks to the peerless intrepidity I developed at testicular boot camp.
  But it
  was a trap! I was imprisoned in that uterine gulag for nine grueling
  months."
  
  [in flashback]
  
  Stewie: Day 171. I've sprouted
  another finger. Counting the
  one from yesterday, I'm up to 11.
  
  [back to diary]
  
  Stewie: "As the months of solitude
  passed, I began to
  go insane. It seemed my prison cell was getting smaller and smaller. I
  was
  quite sure that soon I would be dead. But then, a miracle! There was a
  light at
  the end of the tunnel. I rushed to freedom, but suddenly I was ambushed
  by a
  mysterious man in white!" <aloud> The man in white. Of
  course! He
  must be the hired professional of whom they spoke. He failed to thwart
  my escape
  into the outside world. And now, one year hence, he's returning to
  rectify his
  mistake and-put me back in the womb! 
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  
  Girl 1: Boy, it sure is great being
  thin and popular.
  
  Girl 2: Let's go throw up.
  
  Girl 1: Sure!
  
  Girl 3: Good idea!
  
  Meg: Hey, I love throwing up.
  
  Girls: [Laughing]
  
  Meg: [Sighs]
  
  Jennifer: Hi. I'm Jennifer.
  
  Meg: I'm Meg.
  
  Jennifer: Oh, my God. Your hair is so
  beautiful. I just want
  to brush it.
  
  Meg: Really? You want to go throw up?
  
  [Western instrumental music]
  
  Chris: Hey, Dad, let's go whack some
  moles!
  
  Peter: Now, Chris, we're not here for
  fun.
  
  [Children giggling]
  
  Peter: Your mom is counting on us to
  drop off the deposit.
  So let's just deliver the check and uh...Hong Kong Phooey!
  
  Chris: Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat
  my dust!
  
  Peter: Come on, move it! Oh, man!
  Chris, this place is
  great. Hye, pull over, you bastard! Oh, man.
  
  Chris: Hey, Dad, they even got games
  in the bathroom. Look,
  I won a balloon!
  
  Peter: Oh, way to go, Chris. Where's
  my watch?
  
  Boy: All right. I won a watch. What's
  The Dukes of Hazzard?
  
  Peter: Hey, that's mine. Hey, come
  on. Come on, give that
  back!
  
  Boy: Give it!
  
  Peter: Come on!
  
  Uncle Jesse: Folks in Hazzard County
  hadn't seen a watch
  fight in a good long time. Them boys rassled for a
  
  full five minutes before the manager
  stepped in.
  
  Peter: Come on! Come on! Come on!
  
  Boy: Hands off, fatty!
  
  Employee: Sir, I'm going to have to
  ask you to leave.
  
  Peter: Hey, I'm a paying customer.
  Look, I got a deposit
  check for my kid's birthday party right here.
  
  Employee: Ooh, Mr. Griffin. I am
  terribly sorry. We're
  really looking forward to Stewie's special day.
  
  Peter: Well, now I don't know. After
  the emotional trauma
  I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount.
  
  Employee: Sir, our prices are set by
  the corporate office.
  
  Peter: Well then, maybe I'll just
  take my business
  elsewhere. Good luck filling our spot by this Saturday.
  
  Man: I got cash!
  
  Woman: I'll take it!
  
  Man 2: Me first.
  
  Employee: Suit yourself.
  
  Peter: Wait. Wait, I was just
  bluffing. My wife has her
  heart set on this place. [yells after him] Chris, this is a big day for
  you.
  The day you become the man of the house. Because when we get home, your
  mother
  is going to kill me.
  
  Stewie: So the man in white is coming
  to put me back in the
  womb, is he? If I'm to defeat him, I shall require professional forces.
  Here we
  are. "Come to Managua, the Mecca of mercenaries." I must prepare for
  my journey. Let's see. Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios... 
  Lois: So, are we all set at Cheesie
  Charlie's?
  
  Peter: Well, actually, I canceled the
  reservation.
  
  Lois: What? Peter, how could you?
  
  Peter: Lois, I got a very good reason.
  
  Brian: Wait a second. These are
  always classic.
  
  Peter: Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's
  is no good. See, it
  happened like this.
  
  [Spooky instrumental music]
  [Screaming]
  
  Employee: Welcome to Cheesie
  Charlie's. Heil, Hitler!
  
  Peter: Actually, the name's Griffin.
  I was sent by my smart,
  beautiful, and still sexually appealing wife, Lois.
  
  Employee: Ah, yes. We're all set for
  your little boy's
  party.
  
  Peter: I understand we're getting a
  terrific bargain here.
  
  Employee: Oh, absolutely. The
  children get to play our
  games. And if they win enough tickets, they get a prize.
  
  Boy: I have 13 tickets now. Is that
  enough?
  
  Employee 2: Oh, sorry, Timmy. But you
  need 15 tickets to
  live.
  
  Boy: [Screaming]
  
  Employee: They also get food, cake,
  and your choice of
  ice-cream flavors: vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people.
  
  Peter: What was that last one?
  
  Employee: Chocolate. Give me the
  check.
  
  Peter: Hold it!, pal Lois may have
  had her heart set on this
  place, but I love my family too much to risk their
  
  lives. Come on, Chris. We're leaving.
  
  Employee: Oh, no, you're not!
  
  Peter: Oh, please don't make me
  angry, pal. You wouldn't
  like me when I'm angry.
  
  [Eerie instrumental music]
  
  Lois: All right, Peter. That's enough!
  
  Brian: Bravo, Peter. You are the
  Spalding Gray of crap.
  
  Lois: Peter, do you know how hard it
  was to get a
  reservation at Cheesie Charlie's? I had to book it the day of my
  ultrasound.
  We'll never find another place in time! For once, it was all gonna be
  so
  perfect!
  
  Peter: Come on, Lois. It'll still be
  perfect. We'll give him
  the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own
  home.
  
  Lois: Peter, we've been over this.
  
  Peter: Honey, you won't have to lift
  a finger. I got us a
  clown, a cake, a petting zoo, a big-ass pinata,
  the works! 
  Lois: You got all those things?
  
  Peter: You bet I did.
  
  Lois: Wow. Even Cheesie Charlie's
  doesn't have a petting
  zoo. Okay, I'll call the parents and let them know the party's here.
  
  Brian: You don't have any of those
  things.
  
  Peter: How do you know?
  
  Brian: Peter, face it. You're a
  terrible liar.
  
  Man: [Sniffing]
  
  Peter: Uh, it was you.
  
  Brian: YOu know, clowns and petting
  zoos book months in
  advance. You're gonna have a tough time finding a...hold on.
  
  Driver: Ya! Ya!
  
  [Horses neighing]
  
  Brian: Some day.
  
  Ticket agent: Well, hey there, little
  boy. Are you lost?
  
  Stewie: Now, listen to me..."Jolene."
  I've got an
  army to raise, and I must get to Nicaragua. I require a window seat and
  an
  in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles! Oh, God help you if I find
  pickles. 
  Ticket agent: Henry, I have a lost
  little boy.
  
  Henry: Well, hey there, little fella.
  Why don't you come
  with me?
  
  Stewie: No, damn you! You're one of
  them, aren't you? What
  are they paying you? I'll double it! I'll give you whatever you want!
  Money!
  Women! Men?
  
  Chris: Uh, Dad, what are we doing
  here again?
  
  Peter: Pigs, Chris. We're getting
  pigs for Stewie's petting
  zoo.
  
  [Blower starting] [Pig squealing]
  
  [Pigs squealing] [Motor stopping]
  
  Peter: Crafty swine. "UPS!" Little
  bastards ain't
  as smart as... 
  Meg: Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer. She
  gave me a ride home.
  
  Lois: Meg, you made a friend.
  
  Jennifer: What a lovely house, Mrs.
  G. Meg, you didn't tell
  me your mother was just like Martha Stewart.
  
  Lois: Oh, no. Once you get to know
  me, I'm really very nice.
  
  Jennifer: You know what's nice?
  Having a friend like Meg.
  And kittens. It was super swell meeting you. Bye, Meg. Friends forever.
  
  Meg: Forever and ever.
  
  [Giddy laughter]
  
  Jennifer: Wow! What a great yard!
  
  Meg: Guess what, Mom? Jennifer
  invited me to a party on
  Saturday.
  
  Lois: This Saturday? Meg, you can't
  miss Stewie's first
  birthday.
  
  Meg: But Mom...
  
  Lois: Meg, our entire family is going
  to be here for
  Stewie's party. And that includes you. Understood?
  
  Meg: I can't believe you'd put your
  family before your own
  daughter!
  
  Brian: She's a whiny little runt,
  isn't she?
  
  Lois: [gasp]
  
  Brian: I said "runt."
  
  Peter: I don't think I'm in the right
  place. I'm looking for
  a guy to entertain the kids at my son's birthday.
  
  Man: Sure. I can do that.
  
  Peter: You do children's parties?
  
  Man: Yeah. I can do, like, a
  handstand, and some somersaults
  maybe. I can make pretend like the children are little bugs in my web.
  
  Henry: Do you know your phone number,
  son?
  
  Stewie: The only way you'll get me to
  talk is through slow,
  painful torture. And I don't think you've got the grapes!
  
  Henry: Oh, sounds like you don't want
  to go home. Are you
  running away?
  
  Stewie: Stewart Gilligan Griffin runs
  from nothing!
  
  Henry: You know, son, running away
  never solves anything.
  You're getting to be a big boy now. And part of growing up means facing
  your
  problems head on.
  
  Stewie: Hmmm. The ruptured
  capillaries in your nose belie
  the clarity of your wisdom. You're saying I must return to face this
  man in
  white myself. So be it. As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt
  thanks
  will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite!
  
  Brian: well, Peter, you've only got a
  couple of hours left.
  If you pull a party out of your ass, you might want to stand up.
  
  Meg: Dad, my friend Jennifer invited
  me to hang out with a
  bunch of her friends. Can I go?
  
  Peter: Oh no, I'm not fallin' for
  this trick. Did you ask
  your mother?
  
  Meg: Yes.
  
  Peter: Okay, then. Have fun,
  sweetheart.
  
  Meg: Thanks, Daddy!
  
  Peter: Brian, Stewie's birthday is
  gonna suck. The only
  stuff I could get on such short notice was a cake and that big-ass
  pinata. 
  Brian: I sure hope candy comes out of
  that.
  
  Peter: Face it, Brian. I'm a bad
  father, a lousy husband,
  and a snappy dresser. I'll never be able to face Lois.
  
  Brian: Well, the circus is in town.
  Maybe you could run away
  and join it.
  
  Peter: The circus!
  
  [Marching band playing] [Elephant
  trumpeting]
  
  Neighbor: Hi. This is the right day,
  isn't it?
  
  Lois: Oh, yes. Peter should be back
  any minute and then we
  can start the party, I hope.
  
  Peter: Hey, Lois, look. The two
  symbols of the Republican
  party: an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change.
  
  Lois: Oh, Peter, this is the most
  wonderful celebration I
  could have imagined.
  
  Peter: Yeah. Where's Stewie?
  
  Lois: He's upstairs, resting up for
  his big day.
  
  [Oriental instrumental music]
  
  Lois: I'll get him. If you see Meg,
  tell her to take plenty
  of pictures.
  
  Peter: Meg's not here. She went to a
  friend's house.
  
  Lois: What? She's gonna miss Stewie's
  birthday.
  
  Peter: Yeah, I dropped her off an
  hour ago. Boy, is she
  gonna be sorry, or what?
  
  Lois: Oh, Peter. How could you let
  her go?
  
  Peter: Jeez, what's the big deal? So
  Meg's with her new
  friends. They seemed like some nice kids.
  
  Jennifer: I'm glad you could join us,
  Meg. We're gonna have
  a great time on our trip.
  
  Meg: A trip? Like to the beach?
  'Cause I didn't bring my
  bathing suit.
  
  Jennifer: Oh, you won't need anything
  where we're going.
  Excuse me. I've gotta go mix the punch.
  
  [ominous music playing]
  
  [circus music playing]
  
  Chris: Hey, birthday dude! You want
  some ice cream?
  
  Stewie: Yes. But no sprinkles! For
  every sprinkle I find, I
  shall kill you!
  
  Peter: Oh, come on, Lois. I hate to
  see you so upset. Look,
  we got animals, we got clowns. I mean, a party couldn't be any better
  if Jesus
  himself showed up.
  
  Jesus: Okay, everybody. For my next
  miracle, I'm gonna turn
  water into funk.
  
  [Disco music playing]
  
  Lois: Peter, the circus is terrific.
  But it's not just
  Stewie's birthday. We're also celebrating the day our family became
  whole.
  Today means nothing if Meg isn't here.
  
  Jennifer: Meg, you seem sad. Today's
  a happy day.
  
  Meg: I know. It's just that...I
  really like that guy over
  there. But he doesn't even know I exist. He must think I'm a total dog.
  
  Jennifer: Oh, that is so not true.
  
  Meg: Then what is it?
  
  Jennifer: He's a eunuch.
  
  Meg: Really?
  
  Jennifer: Sure. All the guys here
  have been castrated. It's
  cool.
  
  Boy 1: Hey, do you think that girl is
  hot?
  
  Boy 2: No!
  
  Boy 1: Me neither.
  
  [Elephant trumpeting]
  
  Brian: Hey, you. Hit me. There, now,
  if I can just find a
  midget with some gin, I'll be in business. Where are you off to?
  
  Peter: I gotta make things right for
  Lois and get this
  monkey off my back. Ow! Knock it off! Hey! Hey!
  
  Stewie: All right, men, the man in
  white is coming to put me
  back in the womb. Today he comes for me, but tomorrow it could be you
  or you! I
  offer you the opportunity to join me in glorious battle. I know there
  are some
  amongst you whose motor skills are not developed. Sadly, you will be
  used as
  decoys. But your children's children will know that you fell for a
  noble cause.
  Now, who's with me?
  
  Boy: Duckie?
  
  Stewie: Useless, every one of you!
  Fine. I'll defend myself,
  and the hell with all of you! Ah! There, I've gone and soiled myself.
  Are you
  happy now?
  
  [Gong goes off]
  
  Jennifer: Ooh! Our leader is here to
  take us on our journey!
  
  Cult leader: My children, rejoice.
  The hour of
  transformation is close at hand. Who are you?
  
  Jennifer: This is Meg, o wise one.
  Can she come with us?
  
  Cult leader: Perhaps. Do you have a
  mind that seeks
  enlightenment and a heart that seeks purity?
  
  Meg: Well, not really.
  
  Cult leader: Okay. Are you a confused
  adolescent desperately
  seeking acceptance from an undifferentiated ego mass that demands
  conformity?
  
  Meg: Wow, that sort of sounds more
  like me.
  
  Cult leader: Great! Well, then all
  you need is a dark-blue
  jogging suit. Let's see what we have in stock. What are you? About a 9?
  
  Meg: No. A 6.
  
  Cult leader: ...Right. Dispense the
  refreshments.
  
  Peter: Oh, Meg, there you are.
  
  Meg: Dad, what are you doing here?
  Oh, I'm so embarrassed, I
  could die!
  
  Boy: Hey, hey, not before the rest of
  us!
  
  Peter: Meg, your mother wants the
  family together today.
  
  Meg: It's just Stewie's birthday. So
  what if I'm not there?
  Who's gonna remember?
  
  Peter: Your mom will, trust me. She
  remembers everything. In
  fact, she always says the best memories she has are when you kids were
  born.
  Aw, jeez, Meg, that's it. This day is more for your mom than it is for
  Stewie.
  With all she's given us, she oughta get whatever she wants. And, Meg,
  today she
  wants you to be with the family.
  
  Meg: Really? Oh, Daddy, you must
  think I'm the worst
  daughter ever.
  
  Peter: Oh, no you're not, honey. What
  about that fat girl
  from the Judds?
  
  Meg: I'm sorry I've been so selfish.
  
  Boy 1: I miss my mom.
  
  Boy 2: Me, too.
  
  Boy 3: I also miss my nads.
  
  BOy 4: Mr. Griffin, can we come to
  Stewie's party, too?
  
  Peter: Sure. The more the merrier.
  
  Jennifer: Meg, you have the coolest
  family.
  
  Peter: She sure does. Hey-here's to
  family!
  
  All: To family!
  
  Peter: Jeez, look at the time! Come
  on. Come on, kids, let's
  get going.
  
  [Bodies falling over]
  
  Peter: Aw, sorry, Meg. I guess it's
  another bunch of people
  that'd rather fake death than go to a party with you.
  
  Cult leader: Children, the time of
  ascension has arrived.
  Oh, for the love of God. Haven't any of you ever been in a cult before?
  Damn
  it! I can't achieve transcendence by myself. That would just make me
  some kind
  of lone nut. Somebody's got to die with me. Come back, Meg! Whoops.
  Can't
  forget my ceremonial white robe.
  
  Lois: Well, I guess there's nothing
  left but the birthday
  cake.
  
  Meg: Right here!
  
  Lois: Meg!
  
  Meg: I'm sorry, Mom.
  
  Lois: Oh, thank you, Peter.
  
  Peter: No problem. I cannot wait to
  taste this cake. The guy
  who sold it to me said it was delicious and erotic.
  
  Lois: Peter, there's a naked man on
  this cake.
  
  Peter: Well, there were only two
  left. And trust me, you did
  not want the one of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.
  
  Lois: Well, gather round, everyone.
  It's time for Stewie's
  big moment.
  
  [Knocking]
  
  Cult leader: Hello? Is anybody home?
  
  Stewie: Greetings, man in white. I've
  been expecting you.
  
  Cult leader: Who said that?
  
  Stewie: Peek-a-boo! I see you! You're
  getting warmer.
  
  Cult leader: Where are you? What do
  you want?
  
  Stewie: Freedom! What do you want?
  
  Cult leader: I want to get the hell
  out of here!
  
  Stewie: Oh, I'm sorry. We're fresh
  out of that. I'm afraid
  all that's left is untimely death.
  
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  
  Cult leader: What the hell is this?
  
  Stewie: It's a boy!
  
  [Energy pulsing]
  
  Lois: Hey, has anybody seen Stewie?
  
  Meg: Yeah. Where is the birthday boy?
  
  Stewie: Victory is mine!
  
  Lois: Yes. And this cake is yours,
  too.
  
  Chris: Hey, Stewie, make a wish. If
  you blow out the candle,
  it'll come true.
  
  Peter: That's right, little buddy.
  What do you want most in
  the whole world?
  
  Stewie: In the whole world, you say?
  
  [Bombs whistling] [Troops marching]
  [Bombs exploding]
  
  Stewie: Oh, what the hell.

Title: Mind Over Murder

[Cheery music from TV]
  [Mentos commercial showing John Wilkes Booth attempting to assasinate
  Abraham Lincoln, while eating mentos]
  Singer: ? When life is getting to you, put some fresh in your life?
  ?Let Mintos freshen up your life? ?Life is just a breeze when you stay
  fresh and cool? ?Because Mintos puts the fresh in life ?
  Singers: ? Taste that freshness, just can't beat it? ?Mintos freshness,
  let Mintos freshen your life! ?
  Announcer: Mintos, the Freshmaker.
  Meg: These commercials are stupid.
  Lois: They certainly don't make me want a Minto.
  Brian: Totally ineffective.
  Peter: Must kill Lincoln.
  Theme Song
  Lois: [playing classical music on piano]
  [Cheering and applause]
  Peter: [blows kiss]
  [Griffin kitchen]
  Lois: Ow!
  Stewie: Blast you, woman! Awake from your damnable reverie!
  Lois: Honey, I'm doing the dishes.
  Stewie: Oh, well, a thousand pardons for disrupting your flatware
  sanitation ritual. But you see, I'm in searing
  pain!
  Lois: Oh, you're just teething, Stewie. It's a normal part of a baby's
  life.
  Stewie: Very well then, I order you to kill me at once!
  Lois: Oh, honey, I know you're hurting. But Mommy has to clean up the
  house, all right?
  Stewie: No, it's not all right! For the love of God, shake me! Shake me
  like a British nanny!
  Lois: [sighs]
  Peter: Oh, man, this is the life. Hey, hand me another one of them
  Pawtucket Patriots. Guys, guys, I want to say
  a toast to you. Quagmire, Cleveland...
  Brian: Brian.
  Peter: Yeah. Yeah! If you guys were beers, I would drink every one of
  you. And I wish you were 'cause we're out.
  Cleveland:: [Giggling] Oh, that's funny. That's even more humorous than
  that joke you told us last night.
  Peter: Okay, so a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy walk into a bar, right?
  Oh, wait, wait a second. Okay, Jewish guy
  and a Chinese guy walk into a bar. And there's this naked priest
  sitting there. And he...ooh, sorry, Father.
  Priest: No, I've heard them all.
  Cleveland: Oh, look at the time. I promised Loretta I was gonna trim
  the hedges and be tender with her.
  Peter: Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need some time off as much as
  we do. This is when Lois does all those
  little things that women like to do.
  Lois: [Grunting]
  [Car honking]
  Brian: I'll be on your bed. No calls.
  Peter: Hey, Lois. Look, I know you've been busy all day, so I took care
  of dinner.
  Lois: Really?
  Peter: All you gotta do is gut it, clean it, scale it, and cook it.
  [kiss]
  Lois: Peter, I spent all morning cleaning up the house. And in five
  seconds, you turn it into low tide at the
  pier.
  Peter: Aw, jeez. I'm sorry, honey. I'd help you clean it up. But you
  know how lousy I am with housework.
  Remember when I tried doing the laundry?
  [Peter at dryer]
  Peter: Now, let's see. Shirts, pants...her, I'm missing another sock.
  Hey!
  Mr. Tumnus: Welcome to Narnia. I'm Mr. Tumnus.
  Peter: Hey, give me back my sock, you goat bastard! Hey!
  Lois: You're right. It's better if I do it.
  Stewie: Damn it to the bowels of bloody hell!
  Lois: Well, the baby's up. Can you get him?
  Peter: Okay. I hope he doesn't need changing. I'm a little gun-shy
  after what happened last time.
  Stewie: No, no, no, you imbecile! That's not talc! That's paprika! Ah!
  Take that!
  Lois: All right, I'll do that, too! Can you at least take Chris to his
  game?
  Peter: Aw, jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat with my friends,
  drinking beer, telling jokes, and screwing
  around. How about a little me time?
  Lois: Honey, I'm begging you. Just drop Chris off at his soccer game
  and come right home. I need you to look
  after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!
  Peter: All right, all right! You know I spoil you.
  Chris: Thanks for the ride, Dad.
  Peter: All right. Have fun, Chris.
  Quagmire: Hey, Peter!
  Peter: Quagmire? What are you doing here?
  Quagmire: Oh, you know. Soccer moms!
  [Soccer moms giggle]
  Quagmire: All right.
  Peter: I'd like to hang around with you. But Lois needs me at home.
  Quagmire: I got beer.
  Peter: Boo, Lois! Yay, beer!
  [classical music]
  Lois: [shushing] It's okay, Stewie. Where the hell's Peter? That was
  good, Reuben. Now play...Brahms' Lullaby.
?Lullaby and good night?
  Stewie: Oh, enough! The only thing worse than the wretched pain in my
  mouth is the excrement spewing from yours!
  Lois: Oh, I wish I could make the pain go away sooner. But I can't turn
  time forward.
  Stewie: Oh, no? Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine
  that can move time! I shall call it a time
  machine. E-flat, Salieri! E-flat!
  Peter: Go, Chris! Daddy loves you! I-I mean in a platonic way. I'm
  married.
  Referee: [whistle] Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue!
  Mother: That's the 10th time today! Nice grab, orca. Hey, get Moby Dick
  off the field before he burps up a
  license plate!
  Peter: Hey, hey, hey. Easy, fella. That's my kid. Now apologize.
  Mother: Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain-dead stinking blue cheese
  feta!
  Peter: Oh, oh, that's it!
  Chris: Way to go, Dad!
  Boy: You hit my mom!
  Peter: No, I hit your dad.
  Man: Whoa, stand back. Give her some air.
  Peter: You mean, "Give him some air."
  Woman: Call an ambulance. She's going into labor.
  Peter: You mean, "He's going into labor."
  [Baby crying]
  Peter: Whoops.
  [Griffin house]
  Peter: I can't believe I punched a woman.
  Brian: A pregnant woman.
  Peter: I just hope she accepts my peace offering. I sent her a little
  something for the baby.
  [Jack-in-the-box playing "Pop goes the weasel"]
  Peter: Course, I would've brought it over myself if I wasn't under
  house arrest.
  Brian: Well, you're just fortunate this is your first offense, Peter.
  Peter: No kidding. Could've been a lot worse if the cops knew about
  those other times I broke the law.
  [Peter loiters in front of "No loitering" sign; gaze darting back and
  forth]
  Peter: And there was that time I took a whiz in public.
  [Peter in public pool; gaze darting back and forth]
  Peter: And that time I snuck into Wimbledon.
  [Peter at Wimbledon; gaze darting back and forth]
  Quagmire: Well, me and Cleveland are gonna "amscray."
  Peter: Wait, wait, wait. You guys can't leave me here alone.
  Quagmire: Why don't you come with us?
  Peter: I can't leave the premises. They're monitoring my every move.
  [Pong beeping]
  Peter: I gotta get out of here! I gotta get out of here! I gotta get
  out of here!
  Lois: There's my little house husband. It's been so wonderful having
  you home all week.
  Peter: Oh, thanks, honey. But, honestly, I don't know how you stand
  being in the house all day. I mean, I'm so
  bored, I can't even watch TV anymore. All the shows are starting to run
  together.
  Narrator: This contains adult content and is brought to you by the
  letter "H".
  [Phone ringing]
  Bert: [on phone] Hello? Son of a bitch. I'm on my way. [off phone] Some
  poor bastard got his head blown off
  down at a place called Hooper's.
  Ernie: Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much, Bert.
  Bert: Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed!
  Ernie: Bert, you're shouting again, Bert!
  [Comedic instrumental music]
  Peter: I know you can't understand what I'm going through, Lois. I
  mean, all the stuff that makes you happy,
  like cooking and cleaning, is right in the house just waiting for you.
  You are one lucky...
  Brian: Ah-ah. Stop. Now.
  Lois: Peter, I don't do those things because I enjoy them. I do them
  because I love my family.
  Peter: [giggling] Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family. ?Lois
  and the family sitting in a tree? See,
  now, Lois, the guys would've found that hilarious.
  Lois: Why don't I go buy some groceries and make us a nice romantic
  dinner? Like when we were dating. That
  oughta take your mind off the guys.
  Peter: It already has. [pause] I wonder what the guys are up to?
  Cleveland: Oh, that's nasty.
  Peter: Where's the damn pull string? [yells] You never know what you're
  gonna find down here.
  [Dog barking]
  Peter: Ah!
  Pawtucket Patriot: Peter!
  Peter: Hey, hey you're the Pawtucket Patriot.
  Pawtucket Patriot: Verily. Come hither and give heed.
  Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't swing that way, pal. Look, I got a
  date with my female wife. I just came
  down to get some beers.
  Pawtucket Patriot: Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in
  this basement and stock it with
  plenty of frosty Pawtucket Patriots your friends will come down here
  for a beer as well.
  Peter: Build a bar! That's a great idea. Wait, one last question. If I
  walk through you, does that mean, like,
  we've done it?
  Pawtucket Patriot: Jeez. What's with you and the gay jokes?
  [Cheerful instrumental music]
  Peter: [Snoring]
  [Instrumental music slows down]
  Lois: [Sighs]
  [Door opening]
  Lois: Peter, where the hell have you been? We had a date.
  Peter: Aw, sorry, honey. I must've lost track of the time. What do you
  say, eh? You think the guys will like it?
  Lois: This is why you missed our dinner? To make a bar for your friends?
  Peter: Yeah, isn't it great? Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen. I
  build stuff and I have a criminal record.
  [macho grunting]
  [Guys laughing]
  Peter: Okay, okay, guys. I got another one. What's the difference
  between pornography and art?
  Quagmire: [Chuckling] Here it comes.
  Peter: A government grant.
  Cleveland: Peter, you are in the zone.
  Peter: Hey, honey, you know those little clam cakes you always make
  whenever we have company? I need about a
  dozen of-actually, better make it like 600.
  Lois: That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant. And I'm through taking care
  of you and your bar buddies!
  Peter: Jeez. Where the hell did that come from?
  Lois: Watch the kids. I'm taking a hot bath.
  Stewie: Put me down, you Brobdingnagian blunderbuss!
  Meg: He's a little cranky from teething.
  Peter: I can fix that.
  Stewie: [Mumbling] Good God, man! One can only imagine what foul
  regions that finger has erstwhile probed!
  Peter: There you go. My mother used to use whiskey whenever I had a
  toothache.
  [toddler Peter]
  Peter: My tooth hurts!
  [Griffin living room]
  Peter: There. How's that feel?
  Stewie: Well, it's-it's delightful.
  [Bathwater running]
  [Applause]
  Lois: Thank you. Thank you very much.
  Peter: Lois, you are a wonderful woman. Words cannot express the depth
  of my appreciation and love for you.
  Lois: Oh, Peter!
  [Griffin bathroom]
  Lois: Aaah!
  Man: Hey, you must be Lois.
  Stewie: No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is
  quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty.
  What a delightful moniker. You see, Misty...[giggles]...my time
  manipulator borrows axioms from the quantum theory of
  molecular propulsion-I've broken my pencil!
  Girl: I have a Barney pen in my purse.
  Stewie: You are spectacular!
  Lois: Chris, what are you doing here?
  Chris: Sorry, Mom. I'm gonna need to see some ID.
  Lois: Chris, go to your room!
  Stewie: Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one of your
  oh-so-exhilarating games of peekaboo?
  Lois: Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!
  Peter: No, I'm not! Oh, him? Oh, yeah, yeah. He's a real lightweight.
  Lois: Meg, take Stewie upstairs.
  Stewie: ?Show me the way to go home? Everybody! ?I'm tired and I want
  to go to bed? Just the women!
  Lois: Peter, in the 17 years that we've been married I have never been
  as angry as I...what is my piano doing
  down here?
  Peter: Well, it was supposed to be a clam cake buffet, but...never mind.
  Lois: That does it, Peter. Either this bar goes or I do!
  Peter: Lois, honey, I haven't even told you the other reason your
  piano's down here. I wanted you to play it.
  You know, like it was an instrument. I'm telling you the truth. Right,
  guys?
  Men: Yeah. Yeah. Come on!
  Lois: Oh, no, no, I couldn't.
  Man: Come on!
  Lois: Maybe one song.
  Peter: Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks.
  Lois: [Lois chuckles]
  [Starts playing piano]
  Lois: ? You'll never know just how much I love you? ?"You'll never know
  just how much I care?
  Man: Yeah!
  Lois: ? And if I try, I still couldn't hide my love for you? ?You
  oughta know for haven't I told you so? ?
  Peter: Okay, guys. Thank you. You can stop pretending now.
  Guy: All right!
  Lois: ? If there is some other way to prove that I love you? ?I swear I
  don't know how ?
  Man: Sing it, baby.
  Brian: Something troubling you, Peter?
  Peter: Oh, no, nothing. Just all my friends are eye-humping my wife.
  Lois: ? You'll never know if you don't know now ?
  [Applause]
  Guys: Wonderful! Wow!
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Lois: It was absolutely amazing. The second that spotlight hit me, I
  became a whole different person!
  Stewie: Silence, you contemptible shrew!
  Lois: Aw, I bet your gums are still sore.
  Stewie: Oh, you're so observant, aren't you? Are you a detective? Yes,
  my gums are sore! Enough of this! I must
  complete my time machine, move time forward, and end this agony!
  Chris: Hey, Dad! Mom says she was really on last night.
  Peter: Oh, yeah. About that. Lois, see, the guys were just being
  polite. They thought your singing was too...
  Lois: I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better.
  Peter: Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight.
  Lois: ? Gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for? ?You know you got the brand
  of kisses that I die for ?
  Cleveland: Oh, this one takes me back.
  Quagmire: Now that's a woman! That's a house. That's a fish. That's a
  bee!
  Lois: ? You know you made me love you ? I love you! Thank you. Thank
  you. Johnny Muldoon, ladies and gentlemen.
  [Band strikes up]
  Lois: You know, I was born in a little town called Quahog.
  Man: We love you, Lois!
  Lois: [laughs] Let me finish the story, fellas. You don't want to be up
  all night. Or do you?
  Peter: "Or do you?"
  Man: She's a smokin' little pistol, isn't she?
  Peter: Are you a woman?
  Man: No.
  Peter: My house arrest is over, Brian. Round up the guys. Now that I'm
  a free man, we can do anything we want.
  Brian: Uh, the guys only want to do one thing, and that's ogle your
  wife. I tell you, if Lois were my woman, I'd
  keep an eye on her. Then again, I'm the jealous type.
  Man: Wow, Lois Griffin! Hey, I love your act. Nice melons.
  Peter: Hey, listen, pal...
  Lois: Peter, I'm holding melons.
  Peter: Oh.
  Man: And her hooters ain't bad either!
  Peter: Now hang on a second there!
  Lois: Peter, I'm holding hooters.
  Peter: Oh, sorry.
  Man: No problem. Your wife's hot!
  Peter: All right, that's it! Lois, your singing days are over. For
  God's sake, if I wanted to marry Lola Falana,
  I would have.
  [Peter in dressing room]
  Peter: Look, Lola. This whole thing's just going way too fast for me.
  Leslie Uggams: For the last time, I'm not Lola! I'm Leslie Uggams!
  Lois: Peter, having me sing was your idea in the first place.
  Peter: Hey, hey, hey, I just wanted to keep my bar. The whole reason I
  built that thing was so that my friends
  would come to see me, not you.
  Lois: Is that so? Let me tell you something. I love singing! And I will
  continue to sing! And-how dare you
  upset me this close to showtime!
  Peter: Oh, Lois! Hey, watch where you're going, buddy.
  Woman: Griffin! I got a bone to pick with you.
  Peter: Whoa, whoa, listen, pal. I don't want any more trouble.
  Woman: Thanks to your wife, my husband hasn't been home all week!
  Woman 2: That singing hussy is destroying our marriages!
  [Women murmuring]
  Loretta: Mmm-hmmm.
  Peter: Oh, yeah, well then do something about it. Come to my basement
  tonight and drag your husbands out of
  there yourselves.
  Woman 2: Maybe we will.
  Woman: Yeah!
  Peter: Aw, jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside?
  Lois: This next number is dedicated to my very supportive husband,
  Peter. Hit it! ? Don't tell me not to fly I've simply gotta? ?If
  someone takes a spill it's me and not you? ?Don't bring around a cloud
  to rain on my parade?
  Peter: Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh?
  Brian: Yes, your judgment lately has been rather.... Well, you have
  crappy judgment, anyway.
  Stewie: Oh, this is intolerable! This foolishness is preventing me from
  completing work on...egads! The
  blueprints for my time machine! Those are for my eyes only!
  Lois: Thank you. Aw, look everyone, Stewie drew a picture for his mommy.
  Stewie: No!
  Cleveland: Hold up the picture. Let's see.
  Stewie: No, no! No, no! Nothing to see here.
  Man: Oh, how cute. It's a time machine!
  Stewie: No! It's a...blast, what the devil do children draw? It's a
  pheasant!
  Man 2: A time machine. Sure. Here's where the flux capacitor goes.
  Man 3: Oh, I can't wait to build one of these of my own.
  Stewie: I'll not stand idly by while you abrogate my plans. You shall
  rue this day. Well, go on! Start ruing!
  Lois: Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs to kiss you good night.
  Stewie: Burn in hell!
  Lois: Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? ? It's got steam
  heat? ?I got steam heat? ?I got steam heat? ?But I need your love to
  keep away the cold I got... ?
  Woman: All right, break it up!
  Lois: What's going on here?
  Woman: Your little peep show is over! We're taking back our men!
  Lois: Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and
  cook and take care of my kids. And
  nobody cheers. No one even says thank you. But when the band starts
  playing and the music's flowing through me, I feel, I
  don't know, special. I guess you all think that's pretty silly.
  Woman: Not at all.
  Woman 2: You didn't tell us that part!
  Loretta: Uh-uh.
  Lois: Peter, you're behind all this?
  Peter: Yes. And you'll never catch me! [giggles maniacally] [screams
  repeatedly]
  Lois: I bet he also didn't tell you he never helps me around the house.
  Or takes me out to dinner. Or notices
  when I get my hair done.
  Woman 3: Oh, no, that's just...
  Woman: My husband's the same way.
  Woman 2: So's mine.
  [People chattering]
  Quagmire: Oh, this place is full of dead pigeons. I'm gonna go grab
  some ozone. Peter! There's a king in the cards!
  Stewie: They saw my blueprints! What a grievous breach of security!
  Damn! What do to? Wait for it...wait for it...yes! Instead of moving
  time forward to bypass this wretched teething, it might just be
  possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those
  damnable blueprints.
  Man: You'll never get away with this!
  Stewie: Silence!
  Peter: Lois, you make it sound like I don't appreciate you at all.
  Lois: Peter, when was the last time you told me you love me?
  Peter: You know I do.
  Lois: I want to hear it!
  Peter: Is that what this is all about?
  Quagmire: Run for your lives!
  Peter: Holy crap! Ah! Hot, hot, hot!
  [Explosion] [Screaming]
  Lois: There's no way out!
  Stewie: At last! My time device is complete! Just one final adjustment.
  There. Now I shall negate ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.
  Blast!
  Peter: Aw, jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this
  alive I'm gonna help out around the house and say "I love you" every
  day.
  Lois: You mean it?
  Peter: Ah, I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man. And to think, if I
  hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game I never would've learned this
  valuable lesson.
  [People talking backwards]
  [Mystical instrumental music]
  [Backwards speech slowing]
  Lois: Honey, I'm begging you. Just drop Chris off at his soccer game
  and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching
  piano lessons, please!
  Peter: All right, all right! You know I spoil you. My foot! I can't
  walk! I guess you'll have to take Chris yourself. [Giggles]
  Stewie: Ah! My device! Ah! My teeth!
  Incisor: I'm free! Free! I claim this mouth in the name of Incisor!
  Bicuspid: I think not!
  Incisor: Bicuspid! We meet again.
  Bicuspid: Have at you!
  Incisor: En garde!
  Bicuspid:Shall we bite the tongue then?
  Incisor: On three. One, two...
  Stewie: [Screams]

Title: A Hero Sits Next Door

[Cheery instrumental music]
  Stewie: Oh, Machiavelli! You've told me nothing I don't already know!
  Ah, Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."
  Lois: Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the
  Teletubbies.
  Stewie: How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all
  mankind. Ooh, fuzzy.
  Teletubby: [giddy laughter] Tickle.
  Stewie: God, the more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I
  can't look away!
  Teletubbies: Again! Again!
  Stewie: Yes! Yes! Again! Again! Oh, dear God, please once more!
  Peter: Sorry, Stewie. A&E Biography is doing the life of the
  other guy from Wham.
  Stewie: I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies!
  Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and
  painless.
  Theme Song
  Mr. Weed: Attention, please. Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a
  lot of work to do for Saturday's game. Let's not forget how badly we
  were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties.
  [softball flashback]
  Pawtucket players: [Raucous laughter]
  Peter: [Peter giggles] Look at those morons and their stupid glasses.
  [Happy-Go-Lucky Toys factory floor]
  Peter: Oh, man. I hate those guys. More than I hate spinach, traffic
  jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H. You know, when Alan Alda took
  over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy? Huh,
  am I right? Who's with me?
  Mr. Weed: This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret
  weapon: Guillermo.
  Man: [Screaming]
  Mr. Weed: Bravo! I hired Guillermo because I believe he will be an
  asset to our company on and off the field.
  [Mr. Weed's office]
  Mr.Weed You have impeccable credentials. I'm sure I can find a position
  for you somewhere.
  [Happy-Go-Lucky Toys factory floor]
  Mr.Weed: Back to work, people.
  Peter: Heya, Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action
  figures. Facts of Life Transformers, huh? Watch the transformation:
  cute as a button/fat as a cow/radioactive scorpion. Huh? Watch out,
  Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair!
  Mr. Weed: I'll consider it.
  Peter: He'll consider it! Hey, I got another one where Natalie's one of
  those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park.
  [Applause on TV]
  Contestant: Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. "Go tuck yourself
  in."
  Pat Sajak: You got it.
  Chris: Well, you were close, Dad.
  Peter: Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, "My hairy
  aunt." Come on, Brian. I gotta get to softball practice.
  Lois: Practice? I thought we were go next door and welcome our new
  neighbors.
  Peter: Oh, no, no, no. I don't want anything to do with neighbors. Last
  guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.
  Man: If that slut wants full custody of the kids, she's got it.
  [Short-circuiting]
  Lois: Peter, they might be very nice people.
  Peter: "Very nice people." Yeah, that's what they always say. Then you
  open up the septic tank and bam! Skeleton city!
  Brian: [Panting]
  Woman: Pervert!
  Brian: Oh, don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands.
  Mr. Weed: Okay, my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys, time for batting practice.
  Guillermo, you're up. Unfortunately, Johnson isn't here to pitch today.
  His wife is in labor.
  Peter: Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch.
  Brian: Ha. I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or
  Bill Clinton's integrity.
  Peter: Oh, how hard...
  [Laugh track]
  Peter: Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?
  Peter: Okay. Take your base.
  Mr. Weed: Somebody call 911. Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and
  white zinfandel! Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace
  Guillermo, you're fired!
  Peter: Oh, man. What am I gonna do if I get fired? I'll have to go back
  to my old job as a Calvin Klein model.
  Girl 1: I don't wanna be just like everyone else.
  Guy: But I don't want to be different.
  Girl 2: I just want to be.
  Peter: What was the name of the bad guy from Tron? Ah, this is gonna
  drive me nuts!
  Lois: Moving is never easy on a family.
  Bonnie: Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence. But
  with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move. And I
  can't say no to Joe. Ever.
  Lois: Oh, Quahog can be pretty exciting, too. Last week, someone lost
  an eye at Bingo.
  Man: I-17. Oh, darn it. [screams]
  Bonnie: Oh, I haven't played Bingo in years!
  Stewie: Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax
  idiotic! I must escape this infernal babble! Aagh!
  Bonnie: [Chuckles] What a little explorer.
  Lois: Yes. He's so full of wonder.
  Stewie: Oh, to be the Lindbergh baby right about now.
  Bonnie: Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.
  Joe: It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy?
  Lois: This is Stewie. Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson.
  Stewie: You will bow to me.
  Meg: Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.
  Kevin: I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar.
  Meg: Will you go out with me?
  Kevin: I'd love to.
  [Romantic instrumental music]
  Chris: Oh, he's gay.
  Meg: You wish! Get out of here, you mouth-breather!
  Peter: I'm as good as fired. Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as
  strong as Guillermo? One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he
  was bench-pressing Mr. Weed. Ah, great. Lois is getting chummy with the
  new neighbors.
  Brian: I think she wants you to meet them.
  Peter: She's always making me be social. Cocktail parties, school
  functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.
  [field in the Middle East]
  Peter: What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab
  guy and I can't tell the difference.
  Joe: You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
  Peter: Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil. You know, you got a neighbor
  on the other side of your house, too. So, you know, don't think you
  always have to bug me.
  Joe: [laughs] I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I
  can borrow?
  Peter: Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver.
  Then before you know it, you're using my supermarket, my dry cleaner,
  and even my postman. Sheesh, can you believe that guy? "Do you have a
  screwdriver I can borrow?" What an ass.
  Brian: So, Peter, did you find a replacement for the team?
  Peter: No. Believe me, I've been looking.
  Manager: Hideo-san would be honored to play for your team. But he
  wishes to know what compensation you offer.
  Peter: Uh, me love you long time.
  Brian: Gosh, I'd like to help you, Peter. But I've gotta go out in the
  hall and chew on the back of my ass for
  about five minutes.
  Lois: Oh, Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday.
  Peter: Lois, I don't want those people there. See, this is why I ask
  you to submit everything to me in writing first.
  Lois: Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college.
  Peter: He did?
  [at Swanson's door]
  Peter: Welcome to the neighborhood. Hiya, Joe.
  Joe: Peter!
  Peter: Oh, don't get up.
  Joe: This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me.
  Peter: Oh, what? Because of what I said this afternoon. Oh, no, no, no.
  See I have that disease where stuff just pops out of your mouth. Go to
  hell! Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?
  Joe: Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked
  to borrow a screwdriver.
  Peter: Are you kidding? You can borrow whatever you want.
  Joe: Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you?
  Peter: Picture wire? You son of a bitch.
  [Dreamy ringing]
  Peter: Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again.
  Joe: I don't want to impose.
  Peter: No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they
  do? They play on their neighbor's company softball team, like this
  Saturday. What do you say, neighbor?
  Joe: Sounds fun.
  Peter: So much fun it should be illegal like...copyright infringement.
  [Mickey Mouse voice] See you at the game, Joe.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Pawtucket player: Hey, you want a piece of gum?
  Quahog player: Oh, thanks.
  Pawtucket player: Ha-ha! That was joke gum.
  Quahog player: What do you mean?
  Pawtucket player: Now you're addicted to heroin.
  Quahog player: I'm cold.
  Lois: Hey, Peter!
  Mr. Weed: It's nice that your family is here, Peter. If your ringer
  doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them-at home.
  Peter: He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action. He
  can hit, he can throw...
  Joe: Peter!
  Mr. Weed: What's he doing in a wheelchair?
  Peter: Holy crip, he's a crapple!
  Mr. Weed: Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive
  paraplegic?
  Peter: Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on. Stand and
  deliver. Get the hell up.
  Joe: Ha, ha, you're a hoot, Peter.
  Umpire: Play ball!
  Joe: Let's do it!
  Peter: I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to
  him.
  Joe: I got shortstop.
  Bonnie: The movers tracked grease all over my carpet. I tried
  everything to get the stain out.
  Lois: What about lemon juice?
  Bonnie: What about club soda?
  Stewie: What about shutting the hell up?
  Meg: Isn't baseball great? [pause] They say baseball's the national
  pastime. [longer pause] I can't taste salt.
  Peter: Ah, crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe!
  Please don't hit it to Joe!
  [Fans cheering]
  Umpire: You're out!
  Peter: All right, Joe! Way to earn that parking space!
  Bonnie: All right!
  Lois: Did you see that?
  Bonnie: That's my Joe!
  Stewie: What the deuce? Half man, half machine. Why, with that
  technology, I could escape these wretched harridans! Go, cyborg!
  [music as from "The Natural"]
  Mr. Weed: It all rests on that man's broad, rippling shoulders!
  [Whooshing]
  Mr. Weed: All right, Joe! Run!
  Peter: All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!
  Mr. Weed: Hurry! Joe! All right! Yes, vamos!
  Player: Let's hear it for Joe!
  Peter: Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe! Yay. Okay. Huh.
  Joe: That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe.
  Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig
  in a blanket.
  Bonnie: Joe, you're so funny.
  Joe: They love that one down at the precinct.
  Peter: Ah, this sucks, Brian. Joe is stealing my thunder.
  Joe: Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!
  Brian: Face it. He's the life of the party.
  Peter: Ah, yeah? I'll show you who's the life of the party. Hey, look!
  Hey! I fell in the pool with my clothes on! How hilarious is that? That
  is so Peter Griffin. Guys? Huh? Guys?
  Joe: That's my idea.
  Mr. Weed: Peter, come here.
  Peter: Oh, finally. A little recognition.
  Mr. Weed: Joe has the most wonderful idea.
  Joe: Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys. You know, to
  show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!
  Peter: Oh, yeah, that's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie
  Baby in a bubble. What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a
  stink bug.
  Mr. Weed: Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company.
  Peter, make yourself useful. Go get Joe a drink.
  Peter: Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job. But the
  way I wear my hat.... No. No. He can't take that away from me.
  Stewie: You! How came you by this metal construct? I demand to know who
  made you!
  Lois: Stewie, it's not polite to point. I'm so sorry.
  Joe: That's okay, Lois. He's just curious about the chair. About 10
  years ago, I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage. It was
  Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen.
  [Tense instrumental music]
  [Grunting]
  Joe: Reach for the sky, dirtbag! All right, pal! You've stolen your
  last Christmas.
  [70s cop show fight music]
  The Grinch: You think you have won, you think all is well, but kiss my
  green ass, I shall see you in hell!
  [Screaming]
  Joe: Are you Timmy? Merry Christmas, Timmy.
  Stewie: Oh, enough! If you won't share your technological schemata with
  me peaceably, I shall take the information from you by force!
  Lois: Well, looks like you have a fan.
  Peter: Come on. Let's get out of here.
  Joe: Peter, you can't leave.
  Peter: Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream
  vacation to Hawaii, right now. Say aloha, kids.
  Meg: What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's
  stories.
  Chris: He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy.
  Joe: Well, technically, he was killed by the state, but funny story-he
  did curse my name just before the injection.
  Lois: Peter, what's the matter with you?
  Peter: Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe? You're not
  supposed to admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for
  them. Jeez, when did it become okay to be handicapped?
  Lois: Don't talk like that! He's a remarkable man, and the rest of your
  family adores him.
  Peter: Well, fine, then why don't you all marry him? And if he's so
  remarkable, let's see him do this. "Hey, look at me, I'm walking. Ooh,
  I'm a remarkable man."
  [Griffin doorstep]
  Peter: Well, look who finally came home. Jeez, I thought you were gonna
  spend all night over at Joe's.
  Brian: I could have. That man has got magic fingers. He found this one
  spot behind my ear-forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna
  stop.
  Peter: I don't believe this. My whole family worships the ground that
  guy can't walk on.
  Brian: Well, it's not too hard to see why. I mean, the guy's a hero; he
  makes the world a better place.
  Peter: Hey, hey, hey, I've done lots of things to help people. Remember
  that time I sang to the kids down at the Sunday school?
  Brian: Yes, and you forgot the words.
  [Peter with kids at Sunday School]
  Peter: ? Jesus loves me, he loves me a bunch? ?'Cause he always puts
  Skippy in my lunch ?
  [back on doorstep]
  Brian: No, no, no, it's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real
  danger, every day.
  Peter: [sighs] You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero...unless I
  put myself in real danger, too, for my family's sake!
  Brian: Why are the pretty ones always so dumb?
  [Creepy instrumental music]
  Stewie: [Screaming]
  [Cat squealing]
  Dispatch radio: We hava a gang shooting on Third and Main. Three
  wounded, one dead.
  Brian: Is it me, or is rap music just getting lazier?
  Peter: No, no. It's my new police scanner. This hero thing is gonna be
  easy once I find the right crime.
  Dispatch radio: We have a domestic disturbance...
  Peter: Boring!
  Dispatch radio: Report of a stabbing at...
  Peter: Blah blah blah blah blah.
  Dispatch radio: All units! All units! A major bank robbery is in
  progress at Quahog Bank and Trust. Suspects are armed and extremely
  dangerous.
  Peter: Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?
  Brian: Uh, over at Joe's.
  Peter: Well, go fetch 'em. They're about to see a real hero in action.
  To the Batcave!
  ["Batman" music]
  Peter: Uh-oh.
  [Bats screeching]
  Peter: Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
  [driving in car]
  Peter: You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
  Lois: Peter, what's the big rush?
  Peter: All right, you guys wait right here. Daddy's gonna make a little
  withdrawal.
  Robber 1: Let's give Tammy a round of applause. This was her first
  robbery and she was very brave.
  [applause]
  Robber 2: Now before we go...
  Girl: No, don't go.
  Robber 2: Oh, princess, we have to.
  Peter: I hope you brought your striped pajamas, boys. 'cause there's a
  five-year sleepover at the big house, and you're invited.
  Robber 2: You'll never take us alive!
  [Gunshots]
  Peter: Oh, Lois and the kids should be in here to see this.
  Brian: Yes. It's going very well.
  Meg: Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice
  you?
  Chris: Meg loves Kevin.
  Meg: Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!
  Lois: Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl. He'll come around.
  Meg: Such a mom answer.
  Lois: Well, have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom
  answer?
  Meg: Creepy.
  Lois: Oh, I saw some cute dresses down the street. If nothing else,
  it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys.
  Brian: Well, if you want to be a hero, now might be a good time.
  Peter: Jeez, Brian, this isn't what I was expecting. I thought being a
  hero would be all fun and games.
  [Superfriends music]
  [card game at the Hall of Justice]
  Peter: Sorry, Wonder Woman, I got three kings. Now let's see your pair.
  [Wonder Woman sighs]
  Peter: Haha, all right. Hey, Robin, what are you looking at me for?
  Look at her.
  [Superfriends institial whooshing]
  Robber 2: Come on. Let's get out of here.
  [police sirens]
  Robber 1: Oh, perfect.
  Robber 2: We got hostages in here, so don't try anything funny!
  Peter: Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan.
  Brian: Oh, good. I was afraid you were just gonna improvise.
  Peter: Oh. Well, actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human
  shield and run like hell. But improvise, that'll be easier on my back.
  [Superfriends institial whooshing]
  Peter: Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and
  wife. Okay. And where are we?
  Man 1: A bar!
  Man 2: A pet store!
  Old woman: Guadalajara, Mexico!
  Peter: Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable
  owner. All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy.
  Robber 1: Yeah. His name is Sparky.
  Peter: Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms.
  Okay, drop it! All right, you guys. Let's get out of here.
  Cop: All right, stand back!
  Peter: Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. Sorry, no one can leave. Listen,
  the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero. See,
  this wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great
  things and, well...
  Girl: Your family idolizes the lousy cripple and not you?
  Peter: That's right! How'd you know?
  Old woman: We've all been there.
  Chris: Cool! The bank is getting jacked!
  Lois: Officer, my husband's in there! Can you tell me if he's okay?
  Cop 1: What's he look like?
  Lois: He's wearing a white, collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses.
  Cop 2: I got him.
  Lois: Oh, thank God.
  Cop 1: Take him out.
  Lois: No!
  Peter: Hey, there's my family.
  Robber 2: I just want you to know I rob banks because a deaf man stole
  my job at the phone company. So, if anyone's gonna bust me, I'm glad
  it's you.
  [Tense instrumental music]
  Peter: But...but, I was gonna be a hero.
  Robber 2: Nobody's going anywhere!
  Bonnie: Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!
  Tom Tucker: A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a
  terrifying hostage situation. [pause] That's right. A hostage situation.
  Joe: I gotta go.
  Bonnie: I know.
  Robber 1: All right, if we want the cops to take us seriously, we have
  to waste a hostage. But who?
  Peter: Uh, excuse me. Shouldn't that be "whom"?
  Robber 1: Okay, you.
  Peter: Crap!
  Joe: This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out
  together.
  Peter: Aw, jeez, not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair
  accessible.
  Lois: Bonnie, it's Peter.
  Bonnie: Don't worry. Joe's an excellent negotiator. I was a virgin when
  we met. It took him three hours.
  Meg: I can't believe my dad is in there. [pause] This'll probably scar
  me for the rest of my life. [pause] I got a new dress.
  Cop 2: Try talking about him.
  Meg: So do you like music?
  Kevin: Oh, yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved. But it
  interfered with my studies. What do you listen to?
  Meg: You first.
  Kevin: I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur. My parents don't like me
  listening to that stuff. But I do anyway, because I am not a robot!!! I
  also like Radiohead.
  Joe: And even though society has turned its back on you, I promise you
  there are people who care. And you know what? I'm one of them.
  Robber 2: He sure gets it.
  Robber1: Maybe he's right. We can make a new start.
  Peter: Oh, come on, guys. Don't let him sweet talk you like that. Wait,
  wait, wait. You can't leave now. I'm supposed to be the hero here.
  Wait! Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera?
  Dang, stupid robbers
  with your guns and your, your make-out parties.
  [Crowd cheering] [Cops cheering]
  Stewie: Aha! Excellent! They detached the human component from the
  machine. Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go! Engage!
  Blast! Must be some kind of proprietary command system. Now on the
  Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter.
  Lois: There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second.
  Stewie: Augh! One day I shall unlock the secret of that device. And
  when I do, Mother, victory shall be...
  Lois: Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to
  prove?
  Peter: I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy. I guess I was just tired of him
  being your hero.
  Lois: Peter, Joe is a hero, but he's not our hero. You are.
  Peter: Really?
  Lois: Yeah. You're always right there on the couch for us, making us
  laugh when we're upset. Changing the channel when something boring
  comes on. Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight
  over it.
  Meg: Yeah, Daddy. And if you hadn't pulled this stunt I never would
  have learned how to manipulate Kevin.
  Chris: And when the kids at school see us on TV, they'll think you're a
  total psycho. And I can say, "That psycho is my dad!"
  Michelle Kwan: And I would never have won the silver in Nagano, if you
  hadn't driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a.m.
  Peter: I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and
  catching bad guys. It's also about just being there for the people you
  love.
  Old Woman: Help! Someone just stole my purse!
  Peter: Who cares? I don't even know you.
  [closing theme music]



Title: The Son Also Draws

Stewie: Oh, blasted matriarch! She has failed once again to replenish
  this frigid box with potations. I'll give her a piece of my mind at
  once! Agh! Damn it! Now look here, you....oh, my God!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Lois: Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie. What you saw was
  actually a very beautiful thing.
  Stewie: Evidently, madam, you and I differ greatly in our conception of
  beauty. What I just witnessed was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!
  Lois: Stewie, mommies and daddies like to hug each other that way. In
  fact, sweetie, that's sort of how you were created.
  Stewie: Ah! That is a vile and odious lie! How dare you fill my head
  with such loathsome propaganda? Get out, you horrid woman! Get out!
  Lois: Okay, honey. I'll go get your teddy bear.
  Stewie: [moaning]
  Brian: Oh, good Lord, you saw them together, didn't you? You know the
  tub where you take your little baths? They've done it there, too.
  Stewie: [Exclaiming]
  Theme Song
  Scout leader: What in the name of our Christian God? You're out of the
  semicircle! All Scouts have to sit in the semicircle!
  Chris: Why?
  Scout leader: Why? Why? Saunders, tell him why!
  Saunders: Because it's Rule 142-B!
  Scout leader: Because it's Rule 142-B! Good job, Scout. Now drop and
  give me 20!
  Saunders: Thank you, sir!
  Scout leader: Ladies, this Saturday at 0800 there will be a soapbox
  derby, as a reward for all your obedience.
  [Scouts barking]
  [50s style music]
  Richie: Mom, Dad, I really like Potsie.
  Mrs. Cunningham: Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy.
  Richie: No, Mom. I mean, I really like Potsie.
  Mr. Cunningham: We heard you the first time, son. You have a homosexual
  attraction to Potsie.
  Brian: You have anything on that remote lower than mute?
  Peter: I got a surprise for you, Chris. Aw, jeez, it'll have to wait.
  This is the one where the Fonz goes,
  "Heyyyyyyy!"
  Fonzie: Heyyyyyyy!
  Peter: [Laughing] Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go.
  [Griffin garage]
  Peter: Chris, this is the speed machine that's gonna win you the
  soapbox derby.
  Chris: But, Dad, I was supposed to build it myself. It's a rule.
  Peter: Ah, come on. Rules were made to be broken. [grunts] Here, let me
  show you the turbo booster.
  Chris: Uh, Dad, what would you say if I told you I didn't want to be in
  the Scouts?
  Peter: I'd say "Come again?" And then I'd laugh because I said "come."
  But thank God that's not the case. You're a Scout. And you know what
  that means? That means I love you.
  Chris: Meg?
  Meg: Chris, get out of here! You're not allowed in my room.
  Chris: I thought that was just when you were asleep.
  Meg: What do you want?
  Chris: Meg, I don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. I just want to
  draw. Listen, I was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open
  with a joke.
  Meg: Tell him yourself.
  Chris: I can't. I don't want to disappoint him again. You remember what
  happened when he tried to sneak me into
  the County Fair?
  Peter: One, please.
  Chris: [sneezes]
  Ticket Salesman: Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed! And horses can't
  talk! No, no, no! Nothing about this adds up at all!
  Meg: Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his
  lap, give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and
  he's butter.
  Peter: What the hell?
  Chris: Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And I...oh, wait a minute. [kisses
  Peter]
  Peter: Chris, I am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will
  never speak of this again. [walks out of room]
  Chris: [Moans]

  Pops: Speed, I do not think you should be in this race! Ha-ha! The Mach
  5 is not ready! Ha-ha!
  Speed Racer: But Pops, I must be in this race! Ha-ha!
  Pops: Very well. But I am not really your father! Ha-ha!
  Speed Racer: [Exclaiming]
  [Crowd cheering]
  Scout leader: Okay girls, get ready...
  [Scouts making revving sounds]
  Scout leader: ...get set...
  Peter: Please, uh, uh...God, I don't ask you for much. But let my boy
  win this race.
  Scout leader: Do not go until I wave my flag. I can't stress that
  enough. I'll wave it once just to show you how it looks.
  Chris: Look out!
  Scout leader: Griffin is disqualified! Griffin is disqualified!
  [grunting]
  [Quahog Community Center]
  Scout leader: Your boy is out of the Scouts!
  Peter: Jeez, who died and made you President Nixon?
  Scout leader: Look, it's been two years! Your idiot son hasn't earned a
  single merit badge. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to administer
  some spankings.
  Peter: Ah, come on. Give him a little more time, huh?.
  Scout leader: All right, all right! You've got three days to earn a
  badge!
  Peter: Three days! That's tomorrow! We gotta get going!
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Lois: Stewie, look what Mommy made for dessert.
  Stewie: Ooh, Jell-O. How exotic! I feel like I'm on the deck of the QE
  II.
  Peter: Me and Chris will take ours to go. We've only got one more night
  to get that badge.
  Chris: Uh, Dad, maybe we should just give up. I mean, we tried
  everything.
  Peter: We almost got that one for insect study.
  [Peter and Chris hiding in shrubbery]
  Peter: Look, Chris. It's a whole family of WASPs.
  WASP Father: My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham.
  WASP Mother: Perhaps I can't bake a ham. But what I can cook up is a
  little grace and civility at the table.
  WASP Father: Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore?
  Lois: I think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much
  time together. But he's the one who should be earning that badge.
  Peter: Hey, where do you get off telling me how to raise my son? Oh.
  Oh, right. Okay. We'll try it your way,
  honey. [Laughing nervously] Hey, there's my Scout!
  Chris: Not anymore, Dad. I'm out. They made me turn in my uniform and
  everything.
  Peter: What? Those bastards! Don't you worry, Chris. I'll get you back
  in!
  Chris: It's okay, Dad. I'm not really...
  Peter: Don't take no for an answer, Chris. You're a Griffin. And a
  Griffin never knows when to stop.
  [Peter in emergency room]
  Peter: Clear! Clear!
  Victim: [Gasping] You-you saved my life, Doctor!
  Peter: Clear!
  [Griffin living room]
  Peter: I'm calling that damn troop leader right now. We're going over
  his head. Straight to the Youth Scout head office in New York. Pack
  your bags, you guys! The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!
  Speed Racer: Ha-ha! Did you hear? The Griffins are going to New York!
  Ha-ha!
  Pops: This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha!
  Speed Racer: Ha-ha!
  Meg: I can't believe we're actually going to New York.
  Chris: Uh, Dad, you don't really have to do this.
  Peter: Yes, I do. No boy of mine is gonna get booted out of the Scouts.
  Chris: [moans]
  Stewie: What the hell do you think you're doing?
  Lois: Strapping you in, honey, so you don't get hurt.
  Stewie: So I don't get hurt. That's the best you can come up with, you
  dull-witted termagant?
  Lois: I brought your Raffi tape.
  Stewie: ...Play "Wheels on the Bus" and get the hell out of my sight.
  Meg: Where's Brian?
  Peter: Hey, aren't you coming?
  Brian: Thanks byt no thanks. I've been to New York. It's like Prague
  sans the whimsy.
  Lois: Will you be okay by yourself?
  Brian: Oh, I think I'll manage.
  Peter: All right, you guys. We're off! Those Scouts are never gonna
  know what hit them. [backs into neighbor's car] And neither will that
  guy.
  [Tires squealing]
  [Adventurous instrumental music]
  Lois: Okay. I'm thinking of a movie.
  Meg: Is it an action movie?
  Lois: No.
  Chris: Is it a musical?
  Lois: No.
  Peter: Is it a good movie?
  Lois: It has its moments.
  Peter: Cool Runnings.
  Lois: Right!
  [Music on TV]
  Scientist: After years of study, I've discovered the secret to longer
  life in canines. And that secret is...
  Narrator: We interrupt this program for some episodes of One Day at a
  Time.
  Ann Romano: Damn it, Julie. I'm a single mother doing the best damn job
  she knows how! And damn it, Schneider! I asked you to fix that damn
  sink two days ago!
  Schneider: Oh, I'll fix your sink, Ms. Romano. And by that I mean I'll
  have sex with you. And by have sex
  with you, I mean I'll fix your sink. And by "sink," I mean your
  reproductive organ.
  [Laughter from TV audience]
  Schneider: And by "reproductive organ, " I mean the thing between your
  knees. And by "the thing between your knees, " I...well, I guess that
  one's kind of self-explanatory.
  Brian: [Hollers]
  Lois: Peter, we're lost. Would you please ask for directions?
  Peter: We are not lost. And even if we were, you know I can't ask a
  human being for directions.
  Lois: Why not?
  Peter: Because I'm a man. Jeez, haven't you ever seen a stand-up
  comedian, Lois?
  Chris: Dad, maybe we should go home.
  Peter: No way, son. We came to get you back into the Scouts. And that's
  exactly what we're gonna do. [Gurgling]
  Lois: What was that?
  Peter: Nothing. [Gurgling]
  Lois: Peter, the car is making funny noises.
  Peter: You're wrong again, Lois. That wasn't the car. Although you were
  right about that prune smoothie.
  [shudders]
  Lois: Are you okay?
  Peter: I'll be fine. I just have to concentrate on driving.
  [Alarming instrumental music]
  Peter: [sees "Dump, next left" sign][Groaning] [Gurgling][sees "Wide
  Load" sign] [sees "Furniture Sale: All stools must go!" sign][Peter
  groans] [sees "I love my Shih Tzu" sign][Peter groans] [sees "Only 15
  Miles to Bob's House of Feces" sign] Oh, come on! That one's not even
  real! Oh, God! We gotta stop!
  [Car screeching]
  Meg: Wow! An Indian casino!
  Peter: Yeah. I gotta find me the stink lodge! [Moaning]
  [Thrilling instrumental music]
  Peter: Come on, you guys. No time to lose! Hold it. Hold it! Hold it!
  [Moaning]
  Indian robot: How! And welcome to our casino, palefaces. Feel free to
  visit gift shop in lobby and restaurant on second floor.
  Indian Robot 2: Do you have reservations?
  Indian Robot: Only about the veal!
  Robots: [Laughing]
  Peter: Aw, jeez, this is gonna be a photo finish, Lois![Moaning]
  Lois: I'm gonna ask someone for directions. Meg, watch Stewie. Excuse
  me. Can you tell me how to get to New York?
  Sees You Coming: Well, sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am? Don't you
  want to play a little first?
  Lois: Thank you. But I really don't approve of, you know, gambling.
  Sees You Coming: Well, technically, it's not really gambling. It's just
  us trying to rebuild our shattered culture after you raped our land and
  defiled our women.
  Lois: Well, as long as you're not using it for firewater.
  Carrot Scalp: Look, a "bow" tie. [Singing] I'm David "Bow"ie. "Bow"
  Derek!
  Stewie: Oh, very funny! Now tell the one that doesn't suck!
  [Laughter and applause]
  Stewie: Oh. thank you. Thank you. Yes, yes. And what's the deal with
  airline food?
  Peter: Hey, thanks, "Watches You Pee." Where's your mother?
  Chris: Over there.
  Peter: I didn't know you knew how to play poker.
  Lois: Yeah.
  Peter: How you doing?
  Lois: Yeah.
  Peter: That's good, honey. Let's go.
  Lois: Yeah. It's funny. I never knew video poker could be so much fun.
  You win a few hands and all those lights go off. And you just feel so
  good inside.
  Peter: Yeah, gambling is great. No question about it.
  Lois: It felt so good. I just-I kept putting my money in. And before I
  knew it, I'd lost $40. I'm so embarrassed.
  Peter: Ah, that's okay. As long as you learned your lesson.
  Lois: Oh, I did, Peter...for a couple of minutes. Then.... This is so
  silly. I started playing again.
  Peter: Jeez, I could swear I parked here.
  Lois: Yeah, you did. But here's the really silly thing, Peter. I sort
  of bet our car.
  Peter: [Exclaiming] Okay, I'm not panic. I just need to go back in the
  casino and find a high roller who'll pay $1 million to sleep with my
  wife.
  Lois: What? That's ridiculous!
  Peter: C'mon, Lois, these people took $24 for the island of Manhattan.
  They have no idea what things are worth!
  Meg: Nice going, Mom. I finally get my driver's license and you lose
  the car to a poker machine. How ironic.
  Peter: Hey, don't talk about your mother that way. She is not an i-ron.
  Now, c'mon, we gotta figure out a way to get to New York and get Chris
  back into the Scouts.
  Chris: But Dad...
  Peter: I got it. I'll just get Brian to wire us some money.
  [Phone ringing]
  Brian: [laughing]
  Ann Romano: Damn it, Julie! I am not shacking up with my boyfriend. I
  am just going away for the weekend.
  Schneider: Yeah. All the away.
  [TV audience laughing]
  Brian: [Hooting] Oh, damn, Schneider! What won't you say?
  Peter: No answer at the house. You didn't bet that, too, did you?
  Lois: Oh, I'm sorry, Peter. I feel so foolish. It just seemed like such
  a good cause. Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's
  profits.
  Peter: What did you just say?
  Lois: "I'm sorry, Peter."
  Peter: After that.
  Lois: "I feel foolish."
  Peter: After that.
  Lois: "Casino's profits."
  Peter: Before that.
  Lois: "Everyone in the tribe."
  Peter: Now the whole thing.
  Lois: "Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's profits?"
  Peter: That's it! Let's go!
  Leonard Cornfeathers: I'm sorry to hear about your "misfortune." But
  we're not allowed to return gambling losses.
  Peter: Well, I think you can make an exception in our case, Lenny. See,
  I'm an Indian, too.
  Leonard Cornfeathers & Lois: Excuse me?
  Peter: You heard me. I'm a member of your tribe. And that entitles me
  to a share of your wampum, kemo sabe.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast.
  Tell me of your history, of your past.
  Peter: Oh, I come from a long line of...you people. My
  great-grandfather's name was Jeep Grand Cherokee. I mean, Chief Grand
  Cherokee. He was a rainmaker.
  Chief Grand Cherokee: [Native singing] ♪ I'm so happy doing the neutron
  dance♪ [native singing] ♪I'm just burning doing the neutron dance ♪
  Peter: And he also killed a bunch of Krauts at Wounded Knee. So are you
  gonna give me back my car, or what?
  Leonard Cornfeathers: I have to confer with the council of the elders.
  You wait right here.
  Lois: Are you nuts, Peter? You'll never get away with this.
  Peter: Why not? I've fooled people before. You remember that time I
  pretended to be gay?
  Peter: [watching "Caroline in the City"]
  Lois: Peter, there is no way they're gonna believe you're an Indian.
  Indian: He's an Indian, all right.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: How do you know?
  Indian: I can tell.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Oh, you think everyone's an Indian. He could just
  be another mooch trying to get a cut of our profits.
  Frank: Maybe we can put him through a test, you know? Like a really
  impossible stunt to prove he's the real deal.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Hey, way to think outside the box, Frank.
  [back in office]
  Leonard Cornfeathers: To prove you are truly a member of our tribe, you
  must go on a vision quest. Do you know what a vision quest is?
  Peter: ...Of course I do. I'm an Indian. But why don't you explain it
  to my wife? She's a little slow in the head.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey.
  Your husband must go out in the wilderness without food or water.
  Frank: Or shoes.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Yeah. Or shoes. He must remain there until he can
  communicate with nature. He must hear the wisdom of the rocks and
  trees. And then his guiding spirit must appear to him and reveal a
  great personal truth. And it's gotta be a real vision. We're Indians.
  We're gonna know if he's lying.
  Indians: [Howling ominously]
  Leonard Cornfeathers: [Laughing] Sucker.
  Lois: Peter, please don't do this. We can buy another car. I'll give
  extra piano lessons on Sundays.
  Peter: Come on, Lois. All I gotta do is have a spiritual vision. I've
  had one before.
  [Griffin kitchen]
  Peter: Oh, my God. Brian. There's a message in my Alpha Bits. It says
  "Ooooo."
  Brian: Peter, those are Cheerios.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: You must begin your journey now.
  Meg: Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.
  Chris: Are you nuts? I'm not attracted to Dad.
  Meg: Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.
  Chris: Oh. Thanks, Meg.
  Meg: Yipes.
  Chris: Dad, can I come?
  Peter: How about it, Lenny?
  Leonard Cornfeathers: What the hey? The more the merrier. Now get the
  hell out of here, you nut, and go have yourself a spiritual vision.
  [Mysterious instrumental music]
  Peter: Oh, water! Thank God!
  Chris: Dad, I'm hungry. Are we gonna die?
  Peter: Of course not. This isn't the first time I've had to find my own
  food in the wild.
  Little Red Riding Hood: [humming]
  Peter: [shouting]
  Little Red Riding Hood: [screams]
  Peter: [Laughing] Dumb broad. [Screaming]
  [Wolf growling]
  Lois: They've been gone for over six hours. How long do these vision
  quests usually take?
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Huh? Well, you know, it varies, you know?. It
  depends on the person's age, and height, and...sign.
  Lois: You have no idea, do you?
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Of course I...no.
  Lois: Well, then, why would you send my husband and son out into the
  wilderness without any food or supplies?
  Leonard Cornfeathers: 'Cause we really like your car?
  Lois: [sighs]
  Stewie: They're dead, you know.
  [Wolves howling]
  Peter: Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours. Can't feel my eyes. Wonder
  if club-footed midgets get justice in
  heaven.
  Tree 1: Hot enough for you?
  Peter: What?
  Tree 1: I say, "Hot enough for you?"
  Peter: Yeah. I guess. Oh, my God! I'm communicating with nature! Hey,
  Tree, if one of you falls and there's no one around, do you make a
  noise?
  Tree 2: Are you kidding? Scott fell last week. He hasn't shut up about
  it since.
  Scott: Sure. Stand there and bitch! But would any of you take the time
  to help me?
  Tree 3: Ooh, ooh, I'm playing the world's smallest violin, Scott.
  Fonzie: Hey, yo, Griffin!
  Peter: The Fonz!
  Fonzie: Heyyyyyy!
  Peter: What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in the middle of a
  Tuscadero sandwich?
  Fonzie: Yeah. But I'm your spiritual guide, see? And I want to lay a
  little personal truth on you. Now, Mr. C was like a father to me. And
  he always listened, you know? And Griffin, right now, your son needs
  you to listen to him. Whoa!
  Peter: Sure. Whatever you say. Uh, Fonzie? There's something I always
  wanted to ask you. You were with a lot of girls. Did you ever get a
  sexual disease?
  Fonzie: Herpes twice. And the clap. Heyyyyyy!
  Chris: Uh, hey, Dad? Can I talk to you?
  Peter: Not now, son! Oh, uh, sure. Go right ahead.
  Chris: I don't want to be a Scout, Dad. I just don't have fun there. I
  guess you're pretty disappointed in me.
  Peter: Well, yeah!
  Chris: Dad, this is what I really like to do.
  Peter: What? You want to draw? Aw, jeez, son, why don't you just stick
  a knife in my heart? I mean, so, you drew
  this?
  Chris: Yeah. I know they suck.
  Peter: well, not all of them. Some of these look pretty good.
  Chris: Really?
  Peter: Yeah! I didn't know anyone in this family had any talent. Well,
  except for that one thing your mother does.
  Chris: You mean play the piano?
  Peter: No, no. She.... Yeah. I probably don't say this often enough.
  But I'm really proud of you, Chris.
  Chris: Thanks, Dad.

  Tree: Todd, you stupid bastard!
  Lois: Peter? Chris? Oh, thank God. Are you okay?
  Peter: Fantastic, Lois! I saw my guiding spirit.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision?
  Peter: It was amazing! I spoke to the trees. And I saw the Fonz.
  Lois: Really? What's the Fonz like? I bet he's stuck up.
  Peter: A little. But thanks to him, me and Chris have never been closer.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: Oh, I want a spiritual vision, too! Man! I guess
  we've lost touch with our noble roots. I mean, sure this casino's
  brought our tribe money and prosperity. But what is the price of our
  souls?
  Frank: $6 million a week.
  Leonard Cornfeathers: That sounds about right. Hey, you know what, take
  your crappy car back. Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet.
  Peter: All right! We did it! Let's get the hell out of here.
  Stewie: Stupid, greedy savages!
  Lois: Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say. This one particular tribe
  has lost their way. But most Native Americans are proud, hardworking
  people who are true to their spiritual heritage. They are certainly not
  savages. ["The
  More You Know" logo and sound]
  Stewie: That's funny, Mother. Just this morning you said they were
  lazy, like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding. The Mexicans are a clean
  and industrious people with a rich cultural heritage. ["The More You
  Know" logo and sound]
  Meg: Yeah. Not like those dumb, gargantuan Swedes. Actually, the
  Swedish people run the gamut from very short to tall. And did you know
  that Sweden gave us the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel? ["The More
  You Know" logo and sound]
  Peter: Yeah. Which is more than we ever got from those freeloading
  Canadians. [pause] Canada sucks.

Title: Brian Portrait of a Dog

Peter: Come on, everyone. That Eight is Enough reunion show is about to
  start.
  Tom Bradford: Oh, Mary, have you seen Nicholas?
  Mary Bradford: He's up in his room sulking, Dad.
  Nancy Bradford: Yeah. He's still upset because Abby threw out his
  baseball cards.
  Tom Bradford: Oh, well, maybe I should make him a sandwich.
  All: [Laughing]
  Nancy Bradford: Oh, Dad. That's your solution to everything.
  [Tom starts beating on Nancy]
  Nancy Bradford: [crying]
  Mary Bradford: Dad! Dad!
  Tom Bradford: What?
  Mary Bradford: Eight is enough.
  All: [Laughing]
  Tom Bradford: You know, I love you girls.
  Theme Song
  Stewie: Splendid. That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses will make a
  serviceable parachute should I need to abandon my jet in mid-flight.
  Once it's built, of course. Rupert, did you call that engineer at
  Lockheed yet? No, of course you didn't, you worthless little.... There!
  See what you made me do? Do you think I enjoy hitting you? Well,
  actually, I do. I enjoy it so much I'm going to do it again!
  Lois: Oh, Stewie! My clothes are not for you to play with, understand?
  Thanks for telling me, Brian. I don't know what we'd do without you.
  Stewie: I'm on to you. Oh, yes! Your pathetic attempts to hinder my
  work have not gone unnoticed. You prance about this house like the cock
  of the walk. But will you be prancing when...when...when there's
  nothing to prance about? Hmm? Will you be prancing then?
  Brian: Oh, you just want to eat him up.
  Meg: It is so hot out there!
  All: How hot is it?
  Meg: I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.
  Peter: I don't get it.
  Meg: I think I'm a little sweaty.
  Stewie: You! You seem to know all the players in this poorly-acted
  farce. What do they call that one?
  Chris: That's Meg, dude. You know that.
  Stewie: Meg! You vile-smelling girl, you're not to touch any of my
  things! You understand me? Dirty, dirty girl.
  Diane Simmons: Meanwhile, here at home, Quahog remains in the
  sweltering grip of a freak heat wave.
  Tom Tucker: I don't think you should use the word "freak". Some people
  might find it offensive.
  [Tucker kitchen]
  Tom Tucker: Finish your oatmeal, son.
  Jake Tucker: Why bother? I'm just a freak! A freak!
  Tom Tucker: We're all a little different, Diane. Each of us.
  Diane Simmons: Good point, Tom. We're even feeling the effects of this
  heat wave here in our studio. [Sneezing] Freak. So stay inside and stay
  cool.
  Meg: I think I saw one of her nipples!
  Lois: Chris, that's a terrible word! "Nipple." I'll chalk that up to
  the heat, mister.
  Stewie: I say, am I to strut about all day like a beggar child on the
  streets of Calcutta? Fetch me something linen to throw on before I call
  Child Services!
  Lois: Please don't threaten Mommy. She's very hot.
  Meg: Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!
  Chris: Yeah, well, you're hogging up all the ugly!
  Peter: Check this out, you guys. The Rhode Island Dog Show Championship
  is in Quahog this year! First prize is $500!
  Lois: Really? You know, if you won, we could use that money for a new
  air conditioner.
  Meg: Hey, Brian. You could win for sure. You could do your impression
  of a barbershop quartet.
  [Brian in barshop gear, singing in four-part harmony]
  Brian: ? We were sailing along? ?On Moonlight Bay? ?We could hear the
  voices singing? ?They seemed to say ?
  [back in living room]
  Brian: Uh, sorry. I don't do dog shows. It's not my thing.
  Peter: Come on, Brian. All you gotta do is a few simple commands. And
  maybe a trick or two. It'll be like taking candy from a baby.
  [Baby gurgling]
  Meg: Please, Brian.
  Brian: I don't know. I mean I don't even know where my papers are.
  Can't you get the money some other way?
  Peter: Believe me, I've been trying. That's why I went on that game
  show.
  [on set of Jeopardy]
  Alex Trebek: For $800, this chemical dye is found in over 95% of all
  cosmetic products.
  Peter: Diarrhea.
  Audience: [Laughter]
  Peter: What? Oh, oh, sorry, sorry. "What is Diarrhea?"
  [Griffin living room]
  Peter: Come on, Brian. We really need a new air conditioner.
  Brian: [Groaning]
  Peter: Okay, let's go over the commands. Sit. Good. Roll over.
  Brian: Peter, I'm already shvitzing like crazy here. Let's call it a
  night, huh?
  Peter: Look, do you want to win this thing or not? We haven't even
  talked about how you're gonna wear your ears. You know, 'cause I was
  thinking up.
  Brian: I need a cocktail.
  Lois: Don't push too hard, Peter. You gotta take Brian's feelings into
  consideration. After all, it's only a dog show.
  Peter: Lois, honey, I love you, but you're sucking all the energy out
  of the room.
  [Knocking on door]
  Brian: Come.
  Lois: I got you a little something, you know, for the show. It's
  Italian. Do you like it?
  Brian: Oh, it's exquisite.
  Lois: It's not for every day.
  Brian: Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.
  Lois: I know how hard you've been working. And, well, the whole family
  appreciates it.
  Brian: Thank you, Lois.
  Lois: I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs whenever you're ready.
  And Brian-you look very handsome.
  Brian: [Inhales deeply] Showtime!
  Announcer: Welcome to the Quahog Dog Show. Today's competition will be
  almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits.
  [Bird squawks]
  Brian: Peter, I'm not, I'm not really comfortable with all this. Do I
  know you? I-I don't think I can do this.
  Peter: But you can't back out now. How about a pill? Something to relax
  you before you go on?
  Lois: Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?
  Peter: Not drugs, Lois. Just a little blue thing celebrities take to
  help them perform.
  Lois: Well, those celebrities are wrong!
  Peter: Lois! If Liza is wrong, then I don't want to know what right is.
  Stagehand: Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli!
  Liza Minnelli: Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle! It's time to make
  life a cabaret!
  Blue M&M: Lady, for God's sake, I'm just a hard-shelled
  chocolate candy! Get help!
  Stewie: [Grunting] You there, child-woman! I'll give you a shiny new
  dime if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.
  Meg: Let me see if I can find you a juice box, okay?
  Stewie: And get the lead out, pudgy!
  Announcer: Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, "Brain".
  Brian: Well, we're off to a good start.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Announcer: A beautiful performance from "Brain" Griffin!
  Meg & Lois: Go, Brian!
  [Crowd applauding]
  Peter: All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.
  Brian: What-what the hell is this?
  Peter: This? This is the part where you beg for a treat.
  Brian: Oh, I don't think so.
  Peter: Brian, you're embarrassing me.
  Lois: God, he can't expect Brian to do that.
  Chris: It's easier than it looks, Mom.
  Peter: Come on, Brian. We had a deal.
  Brian: Yeah, well, the deal's off. Me and the little shred of dignity I
  have left will be waiting in the car!
  Peter: Brian, come! Hey, don't you walk out on me! I now command you to
  leave. Yep. Keep going. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, flip me off. Good
  boy. [nervous giggling]
  [Griffin car]
  Peter: How could you let me down like that, Brian?
  Brian: Oh, I let you down? Why? Because I refused to demean myself by
  perpetuating the stereotype of the "good dog"?
  Peter: This is the one thing I ever asked you to do for this family.
  Well, you know, this and not do that thing where you drag your ass
  across the carpet.
  Brian: Oh, oh, one time I did that, one time!
  Lois: Peter, Brian, please. Let's just have a nice family car ride like
  we always do.
  Chris: Yeah. Except for the time Dad hit that deer.
  Peter: Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding. Uh, you know, there's no
  reason get the insurance companies involved.
  Deer: Well, I should still take down your information, though.
  Peter: Really? You could probably just buff that out.
  Deer: Yeah, but I...I would really feel better if I got your
  information.
  [Griffin car]
  Peter: You know, you know, Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong. Maybe
  you really don't care about this family.
  Brian: Peter, if you cared about me, you'd never ask me to do something
  so degrading.
  Peter: Look, the next time I ask you to do something, I expect you to
  do it. Understand?
  Lois: Who wants to sing show tunes? ?In olden days...?
  Brian: Stop the car.
  Peter: Is that what you want? Because I'll stop.
  Brian: Pull over now.
  Peter: Fine.
  Lois: Oh, God. Brian, don't do this.
  Stewie: Is the doggie going bye-bye? Oh, I'm so sad. Quick! Back up!
  [Sorrowful instrumental music]
  Brian: Oh, great. Is there a problem, Officer?
  Cop: Can I see your license, boy?
  Brian: "Boy"? Oh-oh, God. I left it on my other collar.
  Cop: You been chasing cars tonight, boy?
  Brian: Look, the name is Brian. I was just out for a little walk.
  That's all.
  Cop: Uh-huh, without a leash. I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down on
  the sidewalk. Down!
  Brian: I don't believe this.
  Peter: I don't suppose you could let us off with a warning, huh?
  Cop: Sorry, sir. But leash laws are for his own good. The fine is $10.
  You behave, little fella, you hear me?
  Brian: [Slave voice] Oh, Lordy, Lordy, I'll never roam again! [normal
  voice] Jackass.
  Peter: Hey, he's the law outside this house, just like I'm the law
  inside this house. And you better start obeying both of us.
  Brian: Oh, look at you. Big man, can't even afford to buy an air
  conditioner for your family.
  Peter: Jeez, what a bitch.
  Diane Simmons: Good morning, Quahog! Well, the heat wave has finally
  broken, Tom.
  Tom Tucker: It sure has, Dian. You know what they say, "If you don't
  like the weather in New England, go back where you came from. "
  Diane Simmons: Uh, I don't think that's the expression.
  Tom Tucker: Yeah, I guess I had one too many Bloody Marys this morning.
  But anyway...[spitting up] Oh, God. I hope the boss isn't watching.
  Diane Simmons: [uncomfortable laughter]
  Peter: I don't know how those two manage to be so perky in the morning.
  Meg: Mmm. Something smells good.
  Lois: Homemade cinnamon buns, fresh from the tube.
  Dough Boy: [Giggling] Nothing says "I love you" like something
  from...hey, what the hell are you doing, you crazy bitch?
  Lois: These oughta cheer Brian up. Cinnamon buns are his favorite.
  Peter: Oh, really? I could've sworn his favorite was "treat Peter like
  crap" buns.
  Lois: Good morning, Brian. My, your summer coat is really coming in
  nicely. Isn't it, Peter?
  Peter: Yeah, yeah. Must be that special jo-jo-ba shampoo I bought you.
  It cost a little extra. But I would do anything for you, Brian.
  Brian: I'll be on the veranda since you're already on the cross.
  Lois: Oh, eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns.
  Brian: May I have one on a plate, or is Peter planning to balance it on
  my nose?
  Lois: Peter, Brian, stop this. Can't you two go back to the way you
  used to be?
  [Ragtime music playing]
  [1920s style black & white cartoon: "Peter & Brian
  'Fixin' the Shed']
  Brian: It can never go back to the way things were, not after the way I
  was treated. Not after the things I've seen.
  Chris: What did you see? Was it breasts!?
  Peter: Aw, jeez, get over it, Brian. I mean, how bad do you really have
  it here? When I found you, you were
  nothin' but a stray.
  Brian: You swore you would never speak of that.
  [Peter in car; Brian is a vagrant]
  Peter: Uh, no, thank you. I just had it cleaned. No. Aw, jeez.
  Brian: All set, sir.
  Peter: I don't have any change. Sorry.
  Brian: Oh. Uh, that's okay. No charge.
  [Sad instrumental music]
  Peter: Wait. [Stammering] You hungry? 'Cause, you know, my wife makes
  this beef-a-roni casserole. Out of this world.
  [Griffin kitchen]
  Peter: Look, you got everything you could possibly want, right here.
  Now, just eat your cinnamon bun and stop being a bad dog.
  Brian: How dare you? How dare you?
  Peter: "How dare I? How dare I?" Where do you think you're going?
  Brian: Out!
  Peter: Hey, you're not going anywhere without your leash!
  Brian: I don't need your damn leash, and I don't need you! I'm goin'
  for a walk.
  Peter: Don't worry. He won't get far without this.
  [Quahog Mini-Mart]
  Brian: And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered. What? Oh, that. Yeah. I'll
  clean that up on my way out.
  Clerk: See that sign? Now why don't you go tie yourself up to that
  parking meter? I don't want any trouble. " Daughter: Mom, have you ever
  had a problem with "freshness"?
  Mother: What do you mean, honey?
  Daughter: You know. Have you ever felt not so fresh?
  Mother: I'm not sure what you're...I don't follow you.
  Daughter: Have you ever felt like you're, you know dirty? Down there?
  Mother: [Exclaiming] Oh, God, no!
  Lois: Oh, that was Brian's favorite commercial.
  Peter: "Brian." "Brian." "Brian." No, it's not ringing a bell.
  Lois: Oh, stop it! We all miss him. Go find him, apologize, and bring
  him home.
  Peter: Look-you heard him. He doesn't want to be a part of this family.
  And we don't need him-we can get another pet.
  Chris: No way, Dad. No one can take Brian's place.
  Stewie: Silence! Silence! That mongrel is probably decomposing on the
  side of a dirt road as we speak. Let's get a kitty!
  Peter: See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea.
  Lois: I don't know, Peter.
  Peter: Lois, trust me. We'll get a lovable kitty-cat and everybody will
  feel a lot better.
  [cat hissing]
  Peter: Here, kitty, kitty. Come on down, nice and easy. That's a good
  kitty. [Gasping] What the hell was that?
  Brian: Uh, something near a window. Preferably a booth.
  [tossed into alley]
  Brian: Aargh! Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans in the kitchen! Yeah,
  that's authentic Italian.
  [Lady and the Tramp doing spaghetti scene]
  Brian: Oh, don't do that. That's what they expect you to do.
  Tramp: [barks]
  Brian: Okay, fine for you. But what about your puppies? And your
  puppies' puppies? Am I the only one who's outraged here? I'm sorry.
  Enjoy your dinner.
  Peter: Hey, how come you're still setting a place for Brian?
  Lois: Because when he comes home, I want him to know he never left our
  thoughts. I know you're thinking about him, too, Peter.
  Peter: Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me. Besides, we have a new
  pet. And we love our fluffy kitty.
  Woman: Oh, gross. Did he just drink from the fountain?
  Cop: Hey! Hey, you! Stay!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Brian: Joyce DeWitt? So that's where you've been.
  Joyce DeWitt: Shh.
  Security Guard: Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside. No dogs allowed
  in the bus station.
  Brian: My blind guy's in the john.
  Security Guard: I'll point him in your direction.
  Peter: [sigh] Brian's tennis ball. Man, he loved to play with this
  thing.
  Referee: Double fault!
  Brian: Augh! Come on, Brian.
  Lois: Peter, why don't you just admit you miss Brian?
  Peter: You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding? This family needs Brian. I
  need him.
  [Cat howling]
  Peter: God, I hate this freakin' cat.
  Brian: Can you spare some change?
  Man: Why? So you can go buy yourself another bottle of booze? Why don't
  you try and make something of your life, like this dog?
  Brian: That's me! I mean, that was me.
  Man: Yeah, sure.
  Brian: No, I mean it. That was me.
  Man: Get away from me, you crazy animal!
  Brian: All right. All right. You want me to be a crazy animal? Okay,
  I'm a crazy animal!
  Man: Stop! Help! Help!
  Brian: All right, who wants to be next? You? You?
  Peter: Hey, Brian. Brian! I'm here to bring you...
  Cop: You're going downtown, pal.
  Peter: ...home.
  Brian: Hi. How's it going? Oh, God. Uh, I know karate! [Kung fu noises]
  [Dog growling]
  Brian: Oh, look! A tasty little baby! Well, I see somebody's been
  neutered.
  Felicia: Come on, sugar. It's time.
  Brian: Thank God.
  Judge: He's cute. Aren't you precious? Lethal injection. Next!
  Brian: What?
  Peter: Oh, no! You can't do this!
  Stewie: Well, who's up for a little lunch, hmm? Something festive. Did
  someone say Tex-Mex?
  Felicia: I'm sorry, sugar.
  Brian: Help me.
  Peter: Don't worry, buddy. I'll get you out of this! I'm gonna get us
  the best help there is. <writing letter>
"Dear MacGyver, Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip, and a drinking
  straw. Please save my dog."
  MacGyver: Aaugh!
  Lois: You're looking well.
  Brian: Don't get too close. They say I'm dangerous. That's why the
  man's gonna put me down.
  Lois: Don't say that, Brian. Peter is working on your appeal. You'll
  see. Everything's gonna work out.
  Brian: Ha! I may have been born with my eyes closed, but now I see the
  world for what it is. I'm a second-class citizen, Lois.
  Peter: Brian! Great news! The City Council agreed to hear your case!
  Brian: You're kidding! If I prepare my case, I might have a chance
  after all. Oh, I don't know how to thank you, Peter.
  Lois: We're family. This is what we do for each other. Right, Peter?
  Peter, don't stare!
  [Intense instrumental music]
  Felicia: Oh, good luck, sweetness.
  Brian: Thanks, Felicia.
  Councilman: This meeting was called to review the judgment in City of
  Quahog v. Brian Griffin.
  Brian: Justice. For all? Or for some? Does a dog not feel? If you
  scratch him, does his leg not shake? Yes, he is man's best friend. But
  what, what manner of friend is man? I would like to cite, if I may, the
  case of Plessy v. Ferguson...
  Councilman: Wait a minute. Why are we listening to a dog? Take him away!
  Brian: But, but does not every dog have his day?
  Peter: Wait! Please! Please! I gotta say something! Look, all Brian's
  ever wanted is the same respect he gives
  us. Well, you know, that and Snausages. He's mental for those
  Snausages. And sure, sometimes we have arguments, like when he's
  sleeping on the bed and Lois is in the "oodmay" but Brian won't
  "amscray."
  Lois: Peter...
  Peter: Okay, okay, okay. Look. The point is, he's a member of our
  family first and a dog second. And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy.
  Sometimes we all need a second chance. Sometimes we all need to forgive!
  Chris: I stole $10 from Meg's room!
  Meg: I stole $10 from Mom's purse!
  Lois: I've been making counterfeit $10 bills for years.
  Councilman: Mr. Griffin, this dog is a danger to society. Albeit an
  articulate and charismatic one. But the law is the law and can't be
  circumvented by pretty words.
  Peter: I'll give you each $20.
  councilman: Deal. He can go.
  [All cheering]
  Stewie: Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial!
  [Triumphant instrumental music]
  Cop: No. Let him go.
  Lois: Anybody want more pizza rolls?
  Peter: Yeah. Quiet, Lois. Murder She Wrote.
  Jessica Fletcher: Charles Montrose, after all these years.
  'Charles Montrose: Jessica Fletcher! Why, I haven't seen you since you
  had the, the...
  Jessica Fletcher: You can say it, Charles. I'm not ashamed. Abortion.
  Peter: Aha! So she's the murderer!
  Lois: Come on, kids. Bedtime. Good night, Brian. And welcome home.
  Chris: Good night, you guys.
  Meg: Good night.
  Stewie: Dog?
  Brian: Yeah?
  [Brian licks Peter's face]
  Brian: If you ever tell anyone about that, I will kill you.
  [closing theme music]



Title: Peter Peter Caviar Eater

Theme Song
  Stewie: I say, Mother, this hot dog has been on my plate for a full
  minute and it hasn't yet cut itself.
  Lois: Honey, I'll be right there.
  Stewie: Oh, by all means, take your time. Oh, and when you do finally
  get around to it, I'll be the one covered
  in flies, with a belly that protrudes halfway to bloody Boston!
  Meg: Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping in Chris' room this weekend! It
  smells like old milk in there!
  Chris: Hey, if I could find it, I'd clean it up!
  Lois: Kids, keep it down. I haven't even told your father that
  <whisper> Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit.
  Peter: Who said Marguerite?
  Lois: Peter, it's just for a week.
  Peter: A week! Aw, jeez. No, no, no, no. Please, God, kill me now. No,
  no, damn, damn, crap, damn it to hell, son of a...
  Lois: Peter!
  Peter: Lois, sometimes it's appropriate to swear.
  Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the
  truth, so help you God?
  Peter: I do. You bastard.
  Lois: I love Aunt Marguerite. Because if it wasn't for her, I never
  would've met you, Peter.
  [younger Lois at pool]
  Lois: Aunt Marguerite, have you seen my towel?
  Aunt Marguerite: Have the towel boy bring you another.
  Lois: I don't want to bother him.
  Aunt Marguerite: Nonsense, dear. You're a Pewterschmidt. Towel boy!
  [Dreamy instrumental music]
  Peter: Hi, my name is towel. I have a Peter for you. My name is Peter,
  and I'll be your nipples...towel boy! Aw, jeez.
  [Doorbell ringing]
  Lois: Okay, everyone. Give Aunt Marguerite a big Griffin family
  welcome. Aunt Marguerite!
  Aunt Marguerite: Lois! [gasp]
  Lois: Oh, my God! She's dead!
  Peter: Whoa! Careful what you wish for, huh, Lois?
  Chris: What if they bury her, and she like, wakes up because she wasn't
  really dead, she was only sleeping?
  Meg: Yeah. That's what happened to our big brother, Jimmy. That's why
  Mom and Dad adopted you.
  Chris: What?
  Lois: Peter, you remember Coco, my friend from Newport?
  Coco: Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm.
  Lois, where are your parents? Don't tell me they're still on safari.
  Lois: You know Daddy. He won't rest until he kills something on every
  continent. But I'm hoping they'll be back in time for Christmas.
  Peter: Yeah, it just wouldn't be Christmas without your parents.
  Carter: Oh, I dropped my watch. Peter, would you be a sport and fetch
  it for me?
  Peter: Sure thing, Mr. Pewterschmidt. [Screaming]
  Carter: Peter, we've got to put that out!
  Peter: Ow! Ow! Ow!
  [Quahog Funeral Home]
  Peter: I'm telling you, Brian, nothing changes. These bluebeards still
  treat me like scum, just 'cause I'm not loaded. Well, I got news for
  them. I am as elegant as anyone in this room.
  Lois: Peter, we have to meet with Aunt Marguerite's lawyer tomorrow.
  She left us something in her will.
  Peter: Holy crap! Ah, you sweet old broad, I love you!
  [Mourners gasping]
  Peter: [humming] Oh, my God. She's dead.
  Lawyer: Madam Pewterschmidt's passing has saddened us all.
  Peter: Yeah, it's a real tragedy. What did we get? What did we get?
  Come on, big money, big money, big money! No whammy! No whammy! Stop!
  Lois: Peter, please! I'm sorry. He's stricken with grief.
  Lawyer: Before she passed, your aunt recorded a message for you.
  Robin Leach: Newport, Rhode Island. Home of New England's most elegant
  and historic estates: the Breakers, Rosecliff, and exquisite Cherrywood
  Manor, the palatial mansion of Marguerite Pewterschmidt. Marguerite is
  a shining example of how people with a lot of money are just plain
  better than everyone else.
  Aunt Marguerite: Lois, you were always my favorite niece. I just knew
  you'd find a wonderful man who would make all your dreams come true.
  But I was wrong.
  Peter: And now you're dead. Score one for Peter.
  Lois: Shhh!
  Aunt Marguerite: It's time you started living like a Pewterschmidt.
  That's why I'm giving you my summer home in Newport.
  Lois: Cherrywood? That's so generous of Aunt Marguerite.
  Peter: Our own summer house! Now I feel kinda bad for doing that thing
  with her toothbrush.
  [Broadway showtune music]
  [at Cherrywood]
  Servants: ?We only live to kiss your ass.?
  Sebastian: Kiss it? And we'll even wipe it for you!
  Servants: ?From here on in, it's Easy Street.?
  Peter: Any bars on that street?
  Sebastian: 24 happy hours a day.
  Peter: Oh, boy!
  Servants: ?We'll stop Jehovah's at the gate.?
  Guard: Can I see that pamphlet, sir? <Whacks Jehovah's Witness
  with the pamphlet and smiles.>
  Peter: ?My God, this house is freakin' sweet.?
  Chef: ?I make brunch, Clive cooks lunch,?
  Chef and Clive: ?each and every day.?
  Blake: ?Chocolate cake, a la Blake!?
  Peter: ?Hundred bucks: Blake is gay.?
  Servants: ?We'll do the best we can with Meg.?
  Meg: Are you sayin' I'm ugly?
  Servant: It doesn't matter, dear. You're rich now!
  Servants: ?We'll do your nails and rub your feet.?
  Lois: Oh that's not nece-oh my.
  Servants: ?We'll do your homework every night.?
  Chris: It's really hard.
  Sebastian: That's why we got that Stephen Hawking guy.
  Peter: ?My God, this house is freakin' sweet!? ?Used to pass lots of
  gas; Lois ran away. Now we've got 30 rooms! Hello, beans. Goodbye,
  spray!?
  Servants: ?We'd take a bullet just for you.?
  Stewie: Oh, what a coincidence, I've got one.
  Lois: Stewie!
  Servants: ?Prepare to suck that golden teat. Now that you're stinking
  rich, we'll gladly be your bitch.?
  Peter: ?My god, this house is-?
  All: ?freakin' sweet!? Welcome!
  Servant: That's a wrap, people. Now let's get the hell out of here.
  Peter: Wait a second, where you going?
  Servant: The old bag only paid us up through the song.
  Lois: Well, we can just pick up after ourselves. After all, we'll only
  be here on weekends.
  Peter: No, no, Lois. It's time you started living like the piece of
  Schmidt you are.
  Lois: That's "Pewterschmidt."
  Peter: W-W-Wait, you guys! You guys, you're all hired to be full time
  Griffin servants.
  Lois: Peter, where are we going to get the money to pay all these
  people?
  Peter: Simple. I, uh, sold our house in Quahog.
  Lois: You sold our home?!
  Peter: Surprise!
  Lois: Peter, how could you?
  Peter: Whoops. ?I recognize that tone. Tonight I sleep alone. But still?
  All: ?this house is freakin' sweet!?
  Lois: Peter, how could you sell our house in Quahog without even asking
  me?
  Peter: Ah, honey, this is where you belong. You deserve a big house and
  nice stuff. Like diamonds.
  [Classical instrumental music]
  [parody of the DeBeers diamond ads]
  Lois: But I love our old house. You have to buy it back.
  Peter: It's too late for that. Our stuff is packed. It's on its way
  here. Come on, Lois, you'll love living in Newport. Sure, this house is
  big, but it's also very intimate. [Echoing] Intimate. Intimate.
  Meg: So we're really gonna live here now?
  [echo: "Intimate"]
  Peter: That's right, honey.
  Lois: I don't know, Peter.
  Meg: Please, Mom. Look, there's a pool.
  Chris: Yeah. And there's a chair.
  Sebastian: The solarium is at the far end of the west wing.
  Twins: Come play with us, Stewie, forever and ever and ever.
  Stewie: Yes. All work and no play makes Stewie a dull boy.
  Sebastian: Across the hall from the library we have the billiard room.
  And here we have the lounge.
  Brian: Sweet Mary, mother of God! Jackpot!
  Bartender: What can I get you, sir? We have 10 varieties of single malt
  scotch and a wine cellar with over 10,000 bottles.
  Brian: Don't make me beg.
  Lois: Well, I did love spending time here when I was a kid.
  Chris: All right, Mom!
  Coco: Jonathan and I just returned from sailing our yacht around the
  world.
  Peter: Oh, oh. Funny sailing story. All right, this guy's on his boat,
  in the middle of the ocean, right, and he sees a little black dog. And
  let me tell you, this dog's been swimming for days, and he stinks like
  a dead otter, right?
  Lois: Peter, maybe this isn't the place for...
  Peter: Hang on, Lois, hang on. So the guy takes the dog into the vet.
  And the freakin' vet tells him, get this, "It's not a dog. It's a rat."
  A big, stinkin' Mexican rat. True story.
  Meg: Dad, that's just an urban legend.
  Peter: Hand to God. I'm telling you, it was a huge freakin' rat. Five
  times as big as that guy's steak.
  Lois: Oh, Peter, that rat gets bigger every time you tell this story.
  Peter: Oh, I got a million of them. Like the time my buddy's sister's
  boss, he was drinking with a hooker in this Vegas bar. Bam! Woke up
  without his kidney.
  Man: [Vomiting]
  Peter: I can't believe they kicked me out of the yacht club. I barely
  had time to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket.
  Brian: Face it, Peter. You have a knack for saying the wrong thing.
  Peter: This sucks. Lois' friend "Yacht boy" and his lovely wife "Caca"
  invited us to some hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon. I don't want
  to embarrass her again. You gotta help me, Brian. Teach me how to be a
  gentleman.
  Brian: Well, Peter, it's not really that hard. Let's start with polite
  conversation. For example, "It's a pleasure to see you again. Lovely
  weather we're having." Now you try.
  Peter: "It's a pleasure to see you again. After Hogan's Heroes, Bob
  Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having
  rough sex." How's that?
  Brian: Wow, perfect. My work is done. But just for the heck of it,
  let's try again.
  Sebastian: More coffee, madam?
  Lois: I can get that, Sebastian. To tell you the truth, we're all a
  little uncomfortable being waited on.
  Stewie: Cut my egg!
  Servant: Your eggs are cut, sir.
  Stewie: Cut my milk!
  Servant: I can't, sir. It's liquid.
  Stewie: Imbecile! Freeze it, then cut it! If you question me again,
  I'll put you on diaper detail. And I promise, I won't make it easy for
  you!
  Lois: Oh, Meg, you're gonna love Newport High. It has a beautiful
  campus.
  Meg: Yeah, filled with beautiful people. And I'm gonna bag me a rich
  one.
  Lois: Meg, that's a terrible thing to say. You should marry someone you
  love. That's what I did.
  Meg: Yeah, and he got us kicked out of the yacht club.
  Lois: Oh, you can't be mad at your father for being himself. That's the
  reason I fell in love with him in the first place. Oh, he was so
  different from everyone else.
  [Waltz music playing]
  Jonathan: Coco, the day I graduate from Harvard I'm gonna carry you off
  into the sunset on a white horse.
  Coco: It better be a stretch horse with leather seats and a chauffeur.
  Jonathan: Isn't she a bit of terrific?
  Both: [Laughing]
  ["Do You Love Me" by the Hollies playing]
  Lois: Kids, if you marry for love, your life will be filled with its
  own riches. Money doesn't buy happiness.
  Stewie: Oh, I beg to differ. [Rings bells] You! Bring me The Wall
  Street Journal! You two, fight to the death!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Brian: Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to shock
  therapy, but your progress has been.... Well, who are we kidding? You
  haven't made any progress. Now, the left TV is tuned to Frasier. The
  right TV has Ricki
  Lake. If you so much as glance at the right TV, I'm gonna give you
  10,000 volts.
  Peter: Got it.
  Niles: Well, Frasier, you're so corpulent that when you sit around the
  magnificently appointed Tuscan villa, you sit around the magnificently
  appointed Tuscan villa.
  Peter: Huh. This is the smartest show on TV.
  Guest: Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend. She ain't supposed to be having
  no penis!
  Peter: [Electricity surging]
  Sebastian: Master Brian, do you really believe you can pass him off as
  a gentleman at the auction?
  Brian: Well, we've got a long road ahead. But, hey, I've worked
  miracles before.
  Presenter: And the Oscar goes to Marisa Tomei!
  Lois: Peter was supposed to meet us here an hour ago. I hope he didn't
  change his mind.
  Brian: Maybe he's already here. Maybe he's fitting in so well, we just
  can't tell him from the other bluebloods.
  Lois: Well, I don't think we have to worry about that.
  [Trumpet fanfare]
  Footman: Lord Peter Lowenbrau Griffin the First.
  Peter: Play me down the stairs, boys.
  [big band music]
  Peter: Good day. Enchanté. Pasta Fazul.
  Lois: [gasp]
  Peter: Looking good, fellas.
  Lois: Brian, do you know anything about this?
  Brian: Lois, please. I'm just a dog. A stupid dog. Vodka stinger with a
  whiskey back. And step on it!
  [Piano playing]
  Coco: Peter, you're simply enchanting. You must join us tomorrow for a
  game of baccarat.
  Peter: Right baccarat at you.
  Coco & Jonathan: [Laughing]
  Lois: Brian, what happened to Peter? He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres
  in his mouth, or asking anyone to pull his finger. That's not the man I
  married.
  Brian: So, I guess, technically, that-that makes you available.
  Lois: What?
  Brian: Lighten up, toots. It's a party. [Laughing] Hey, barkeep, it's
  like the damn Sahara over here! How you doing, honey?
  Lord Brandywine: Welcome to the Historical Society auction. Our first
  item is a 17th-century gilded vessel. We'll start the bidding at
  $140,000.
  Peter: What a marvelous vessel. It would look smashing in Lois's
  crapper. I mean "crapier".
  Coco: You are so right. Any woman would love to have that vase adorn
  her...crapier. Jonathan!
  Jonathan: Oh. Uh, $140,000.
  Peter: $150,000.
  Lois: Brian, that sounded like Peter.
  Brian: Hey, come here, you! [Laughing]
  Jonathan: $160,000.
  Peter: $170,000.
  Jonathan: $180,000.
  Peter: $190,000.
  Jonathan: $200,000.
  Lord Brandywine: We have a new record for the Historical Society! The
  vessel goes to...
  Peter: $100 million!
  Lord Brandywine: To Mr. Peter Griffin for an astonishing $100 million!
  Brian: ? ...Money, money, money! ?
  Coco: Peter, we had no idea you were such a philanthropist.
  Woman: It's a fabulous vase, Peter, darling. Do you collect objets
  d'art?
  Peter: If that's French for "Star Wars collectors glasses," then
  sí.
  Rich people: [Laughing]
  Lord Brandywine: Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man since Ted
  Turner.
  Ted Turner: I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift the whole world can
  appreciate. I've colorized the moon.
  Lois: Peter, you don't have $100 million!
  Peter: Of course I do, my dear.
  Lord Brandywine: Now, would that be cash or check?
  Peter: Drop by Cherrywood this evening. I'll have the money wired to me
  from my Swiss bank account.
  Lord Brandywine: Very good, sir.
  Lois: You don't have a Swiss bank account!
  Peter: Right. [aside to Brandywine] My lawyer's advised me to keep some
  of my assets a secret, in case things don't work out.
  Lois: I'm going home. Where's Brian?
  Brian: Listen, I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL. Can you help me
  out?
  Lois: I'm sorry. But I've made my decision. We're moving back to Quahog
  just as soon as we can get packed.
  Meg: Ugh, Quahog, that one-horse town?
  Horse: Shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up. You shut up. You're
  the one talking. Well, there's no one else here. Look, everybody just
  shut up! What's that? The wind!
  Peter: A pox on Quahog!
  Brian: Easy!
  Chris: If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just so I can poke poor
  people with a stick!
  Peter: Bon Jovi, everyone.
  Lois: Now I remember why I left Newport! It changes people. You kids
  have lost your values. You've lost your mind! And I don't much care for
  Stewie's new friends.
  Man: The Pacific Rim economy is still a tad shaky for my taste.
  Stewie: Oh, oh, stop it, stop it! You can't become a bloody fiscal
  hermit crab every time the Nikkei undergoes a correction! Asia's market
  has nowhere to go but up!
  Man: Interesting.
  Stewie: Indeed.
  Lois: I wish we'd never come here in the first place.
  Peter: [Sighing snobbishly] Here, go buy yourself some more money.
  Peter: Hey, old bean. Hey, what are you doing with my Star Wars glass?
  Brian: Illustrating a point. Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium
  Falcon to Cloud City, he found that Lando Calrissian had turned control
  of the station over to Darth Vader. Lando had forgotten who he was. It
  was only after Han was encased in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett to
  Jabba's palace, that he was able to see the error of his ways. Look
  inside yourself. You're not a Newport millionaire. I created you. In a
  way, I am your father.
  Peter: That's not true! That's impossible.
  Brian: Damn it, Peter! Snap out of it!
  Peter: No! I just had the craziest dream where I bought a $100 million
  vase.
  Sebastian: A Mr. Brandywine from the Historical Society is at the front
  gate. He'll be here in half an hour.
  Brian: That wasn't a dream, Peter. He's here for the money.
  Peter: Oh, Brian, I'm screwed. If I welsh on that debt, I'm just gonna
  prove to everyone that I'm not good enough for Lois. If I only had
  something worth that much money. Man, I never should've dropped "Mean"
  Joe Greene's jersey.
  [Peter in tunnel at football game]
  Peter: Good game, "Mean" Joe. You want some of my Coke?
"Mean" Joe Greene: Hey, kid. Catch.
Peter: Wow. Thanks, "Mean" Joe.
[back at Cherrywood]
Peter: Hey, what about this house? I could give him the house and call
  it even.
  Brian: Cherrywood isn't worth $100 million.
  Peter: Brian, it's the Historical Society. Look, we just gotta convince
  him that $100 million worth of history happened here.
  Lord Brandywine: So you're saying that Jesus carved his name into this
  mantle 51 years before he was born.
  Peter: Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything. And look over here. That's
  where the stock market crashed.
  Lord Brandywine: Mr. Griffin!
  Peter: Oh, I'm tellin' you, you can't take a step in this house without
  uncovering something historical.
  [model train choo-chooing]
  Peter: Wait a second. Could that be Harriet Tubman's secret underground
  railroad? It is! Go, Freedom Train! Go!
  Lord Brandywine: I've seen enough. I happen to know that nothing of
  historical significance ever occurred here.
  Please, have our money ready by tomorrow. Good day!
  Peter: Wait, wait, wait! Look, this is where the Pilgrims landed at
  Fraggle Rock!
  Lois: Excuse me, Lord Griffin. Your family is going back to Quahog. If
  you get tired of being a snob, look us up.
  Peter: Lord Griffin is dead. It's just me, Peter the towel boy.
  Lois: Peter, you're back! Oh, let's go home!
  Peter: We can't. I sold our home. Our beautiful home with the stolen
  cable and the little man with the penis for the light switch.
  Lois: So, we'll find another place.
  Peter: Your Aunt Marguerite is probably laughing at me while she's
  burning in Hell, may she rest in peace. She was right. Everyone was
  right. I'm not good enough for you.
  Lois: Peter, I don't care what anyone else thinks. All that matters is
  that I love you.
  Peter: I love you, too, Lois.
  [Gears grinding]
  Peter: [gasp] Lois, our problems are over!
  [historians in room]
  Peter:Our mansion is historical, all right. Cherrywood was America's
  first presidential whorehouse! See, there's Lincoln, Grant, Robert E.
  Lee.
  Lord Brandywine: Those are fake!
  Peter: Oh, they're real. And, FYI, Lincoln had the jungle fever.
  Dr. Huxtable: So you see, Chubby Franklin lived across the street, you
  see. Chubby Franklin would always make a face like this.
  Theo: Dad, you're not listening. I have a serious problem. I got a girl
  pregnant. What do I do?
  Dr. Huxtable: And when we saw Chubby Franklin make his face, we would
  all make this face.
  [Audience laughing]
  [Rubbery warbling]
  Theo: Oh, God! Oh, my God!
  Meg: Hey, Dad, you never did tell us how you got our house back.
  Peter: Simple. I just offered the people I sold it to double what they
  paid.
  Lois: What? But how could you afford that?
  Peter: I kept one of those Lincoln pictures and held a little auction
  of my own. Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our house back, and I
  learned a valuable lesson. It doesn't matter if your family doesn't
  think I'm good enough for you.
  Lois: That's right, because all that's important is that I love you.
  Peter: No, because your ancestors were nothing but a bunch of pimps and
  whores. [Laughing]
  [closing theme music]



Title: Holy Crap

Theme Song
  Doctor: Mrs. Lipstein, I have bad news. The tumor is malignant. I'm
  afraid you only have six months to live.
  Woman: Oh, my God!
  Announcer: Got milk?
  Peter: Hey, listen up, everybody. Your Grandpa Griffin is finally
  retiring.
  Meg: Grandpa Griffin?
  Chris: Is he that guy who smells like firewood and has those big gray
  pussywillows in his ears?
  Lois: Chris, that's a terrible word. "Pussywillows."
  Peter: My dad worked at that mill for 60 years. That's almost 80 years.
  Tomorrow night they're throwing a big dinner, and we're all going to be
  there to honor him.
  Meg: Why? We barely know him.
  Chris: Yeah. How come he never visits us?
  Lois: Well, kids, your grandfather has never been comfortable with the
  fact that I'm not Catholic.
  [Church bells ringing]
  Peter: Hey, hey, hey, Dad loves all of us. He's just too busy working
  to show it. He's been that way ever since I was a kid.
  Man: And now the winners of the father-son three-legged race: First
  place, Bobby Hamill and his dad. Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his
  dad. Third place, Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn.
  Peter: Now that he's retiring, me and him can finally spend some time
  together. I want us to have one of those father-son moments, like on
  TV. You know, where we hug and the music goes la-la-la.
  [band playing sentimental music]
  Peter: Thanks, boys. Just like that.
  Brian: Hey, can you guys do that fluttery thing, like when the Brady
  kids run down the stairs?
  [Band playing fluttery music]
  Cindy Brady: I don't want to tattle. But is Bobby really a doctor?
  [Trombone sputtering]
  Meg: Mom, I can't eat. I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.
  Chris: I know. They're like a big, gray, enchanted forest.
  Lois: Kids, your grandfather's ears are not gross. And they are
  certainly not an enchanted forest.
  Ear creature 1: [High-pitched noise] ["Let us run to the meadow and
  dance."]
  Ear creature 2: [High-pitched noise] ["You first. I'm self-conscious."]
  Man: [blows noisemaker] But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket
  Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee,
  Francis Griffin. Francis?
  [Applause] [Whistling]
  Francis: At mass this morning, it occurred to me that I may never see
  any of your faces again. I just want to say that Jesus loves you. But
  in my eyes, you're a bunch of sinners and slackers who forced a
  hard-working old man to retire. So you can take this shiny watch and
  shove it.
  [Gasping]
  Stewie: I adore this man!
  Peter: That was some speech, Dad.
  Lois: Yes. It's a shame Grandma wasn't there to hear it.
  Francis: Bless her heart. She's on another one of her prayer missions
  in Las Vegas.
  Peter's Mom: Hit me, you five-card stud. [Hacking cough] Cocktail!
  Francis: Aye, she's a rose. It's a pity you couldn't find yourself a
  nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.
  Lois: Oh ho ho. Francis, this must be embarrassing for you. I'm in the
  car.
  Peter: Dad, now that you're retired, you're coming to stay with us. No
  more excuses. I'm putting my foot down.
  [Brakes screeching]
  Peter: Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad?
  Francis: I don't want to be a bother.
  Peter: It's no bother, is it, Lois?
  Lois: Of course not. It'll be fun.
  Francis: You're a good woman, Lois. Perhaps you won't burn in Hell
  after all. Maybe you'll just go to purgatory with all the unbaptized
  babies.
  Peter: Hey, there you go, Lois. You love kids.
  Peter: Look at that. Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never
  did for me.
  Francis: <reading Bible> "So God cast the pagans and
  sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell, where their flesh burned in
  agony forever and ever." The end. Ah, children love a good bedtime
  story from the Bible.
  Stewie: Yes, charming. Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.
  Isaac: Hey!
  Francis: [yawning] That was a lovely service, Francis.
  Meg: Super. And only three more hours till school.
  Chris: I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. Mass. I didn't even
  know there was a 5:00 a.m. What else haven't you told me?
  Stewie: You know, I rather like this God fellow. He's very theatrical,
  you know. A pestilence here and a plague there. Omnipotence! Got to get
  me some of that.
  Peter: Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house.
  Francis: Really? What's your favorite book of the Bible?
  Peter: Uh, that one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man
  in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital.
  Francis: [Knocking] Open this door! Open it, I say!
  [Toilet flushes]
  Chris: Sorry, Grandpa. Uh, you might want to give that a minute or two.
  Francis: I know what you're doing in there, and it's a sin! If you ever
  do it again, you'll burn in Hell!
  Chris: But I do it every day. Sometimes twice.
  Francis: Mark my words, lad. You may think you're alone in there, but
  God's watching. Don't do it again!
  Chris: God's watching me do number two? Oh, man. I'm a sinner, and
  God's a pervert.
  Francis: Megan! How was school?
  Meg: Good. Kevin walked me home.
  Francis: Kevin?
  Meg: He lives next door.
  Francis: He lives next door to a harlot!
  Meg: Grandpa, we were just holding hands.
  Francis: Well, it'll be easy for him to take your hand when God strikes
  your sinful heart with leprosy. He can take it right home with him!
  Lord, it's great to see you kids.
  [almost but not quite the theme from The Dick Van Dyke Show plays]
  Lois: Francis, we were watching that.
  Francis: Well, I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast, and
  God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants!
  [Baseball organ music playing]
  Peter: Yeah, not a bad way to kick off your retirement, huh, Dad? Yeah,
  the magic of baseball has brought fathers and sons together for
  millions of years.
  Francis: [mutters]
  Peter: Stewie's having fun.
  Stewie: Why does that man drop his club before he runs around? I would
  bring it with me.
  Peter: Hey, who wants a Fenway frank? Nothing says, "Please talk to me,
  Daddy," like a Fenway frank.
  Chris: Is there a bathroom here? I don't think I can wait anymore.
  Francis: In a public restroom, lad? For the good of your soul, show
  some restraint.
  Peter: Hey, hot dog guy!
  Francis: I'll get him.
  Peter: Oh, no, no, Dad, they bring them to you.
  Francis: Well, la-di-da. I don't need my food brought to me. I'm not a
  broken-down old mule! I can still work! I can still take orders!
  Peter: Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad, look! Hey, Dad! Dad! Aw,
  crap. That was money well-spent.
  Lois: He just left without saying anything? Where would he go?
  Peter: I don't know. I asked him to buy me some peanuts and cracker
  jacks.
  Brian: I don't care if he ever gets back. I wasn't being cute. I really
  hope he's dead.
  Diane Simmons: Well, Tom, the city of Boston is examining its
  conscience tonight in preparation for a visit from the Pope.
  Tom Tucker: That's right, Diane. And I'll tell you what else will be
  examined, this cock. Yes, the Rhode Island Cock Society will be
  sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't
  know why they went with such a suggestive name. They could've just as
  easily gone with "rooster." Diane?
  Peter: I'm telling you. Something must've happened to him. He's
  probably hurt, or lost, or shanghaied by pirates! That renegade pirate
  ship captained by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon!
  [Phone ringing]
  Lois: Peter, calm down. It's his first night of retirement. He's
  probably out enjoying himself.
  Brian: He's in jail.
  Peter: Dad, my God, are you okay?
  Francis: Don't be using the Lord's name in vain!
  Peter: He's okay! Thank God!
  Cop: It seems he broke into the old mill after hours. We found him
  working at a kick press.
  Peter: Dad, you left the ball game with me to go work in a mill?
  Francis: Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!
  Peter: But, Dad, you're retired.
  Francis: I'd rather be dead.
  Vaudville Tumbler: Dead? I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville. You
  know what killed it? The talkie pictures. But you can still make it,
  kid. You just need a gimmick. I, for one, am a tumbler. Here, watch my
  round-off. Hey, kiddo, be a sport. Take the pills out of my pocket and
  put one under my tongue.
  Peter: I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always been the secret to male
  bonding. It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell and his father in A League
  of Their Own.
  Lois: Peter, I hate to say this, but it doesn't seem like your dad is
  interested in bonding with you. All he cares about is work.
  Peter: Wait a second. Work! That's what'll bring us together. We can
  start our own father-son business.
  [Theme from Sanford & Son]
  Francis: What are you doing with all them bathtubs, you heathen dummy?
  Peter: Pop, why you gotta be like that? We cut 'em in half, stick a
  Virgin Mary in them and sell them as shrines.
  Francis: That's my boy. At least, that's what your mama always told me.
  Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sammich.
  Lois: Or, you could just get your father a job with you at the toy
  factory.
  Peter: That's an even better idea! Lois, you're a genius. Now give me a
  hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich.
  Lois: Peter, I can't hug you. Cut it out. I'm serious.
  Peter: And this is the nerve center of the whole factory, my station. I
  assemble our new action figure, Zeke, the moody drifter.
  Francis: You mean to tell me you stand here all day playing with dolls?
  Peter: Dad, it's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a
  tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket.
  Doll: [Coughing] Any of you kids want to see a dead body?
  Peter: Ooh. Wait here, Dad. Hey, Mr. Weed?
  Mr. Weed: Peter!
  Peter: Listen, I was wondering if you might have a job for my dad.
  Mr. Weed: Your father? He must be a man of at least 70.
  Peter: Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape. Except his prostate. At 2:00
  a.m. last night, I thought a horse was using the bathroom.
  Francis: Peter! All finished. What's next?
  Peter: Oh, Dad, you did my whole day's work in five minutes. We should
  sell you to the circus, you freak!
  Mr. Weed: I've never seen such productivity. How is this possible?
  Peter: I'll tell you how it's possible. Because this man always put his
  job before everything else. His wife, his health, even his own son.
  Especially his own son.
  Mr. Weed: I need hear no more. Everyone, this is your new shop foreman.
  Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit.
  Peter: Dad, after all these years, you and me together, side by side,
  father and son, uh?.
  Francis: Peter, this is truly a miracle. I'm so grateful.
  Peter: Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on.
  [Sentimental music playing]
  Peter: Go ahead, Dad.
  Francis: Thank you, Jesus. I have a purpose in life again. Hey! Break
  up the sewing circle and get back to work!
  Stewie: My, my. What a thumping good read! Lions eating Christians,
  people nailing each other to two-by-fours. I
  say, you won't find that in Winnie the Pooh.
  Chris: Please don't say "pooh."
  Lois: Peter! Are you all right? Where's your father?
  Peter: Still at the factory. He's turning the break room into a chapel.
  Lois: A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch?
  Peter: Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin. Bestiality is a
  sin. I'm not sure how that came up
  exactly, but me and Dad have never been closer. Having him at the
  factory is the best... [Snoring]
  Man: Hey, Peter, your dad stinks. I'm working triple shifts, and I'm
  still not Employee of the Week. How am I supposed to compete with that?
  Peter: Hey, where is he anyway?
  Jesus: This'll be for my fourth birdie. Looks like someone's in the
  zone.
  Man: Oh, tough break there, Jesus.
  Jesus: Yup. Or was it? Oop, oop, oop. Boo-yah!
  Francis: Back to work, all of you! What's going on here?
  Peter: Uh, Dad, some of the guys think that, well .since you took over,
  work is no fun.
  Francis: Work's not supposed to be fun.
  Peter: Well, why not?
  Francis: Why not? Why not? That's Satan talking! You're a failure as a
  worker and as a father!
  Peter: Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect, but at least I love my
  kids enough not to spend every minute of the day working! I'm a damn
  good father, and that's more than I can say about you!
  Francis: [Gasping] Peter, you've never spoken to me like that before.
  You're fired!
  Peter: Well, in that case, I'm suing you for sexual harassment. I'll
  see you at home.
  Francis: What do you think you're doing, lad?
  Chris: Nothing!
  Francis: Something's wrong with your shower. The water's not cold
  enough. I like me showers colder than a well digger's kerblocken.
  Lois: I think it's time someone sits his kerfluffin down and has a talk
  with his unemployed son.
  Francis: If Peter needs to talk, he'd best go to confession to beg
  forgiveness for all his failings! Have a glorious day.
  Lois: Peter, how can you just sit there and let him talk like that?
  Peter: He's right, Lois. I am no good. Even my own dad doesn't love me.
  Face it. I'm going to Hell.
  [Peter in Hell]
  Peter: Wow. Adolf Hitler, Al Capone, John Wilkes Booth. Hey, what are
  you doing here?
  Superman: I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster
  than a speeding bullet, so I ripped her in half like a phone book.
  Stewie: Yes, the fat man's going to Hell. And from the looks of his
  midsection, he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity. Oh! I love
  God! He's so deliciously evil.
  Lois: Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband, a
  loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand, a very
  devoted son.
  Peter: That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly, it means nothing coming
  from you.
  Tom Tucker: Well, the moment has arrived at last. We now go live to
  Logan International Airport where the Pope's plane has just touched
  down.
  ["I Can't Turn You Loose" by Otis Redding playing]
  Emcee: Hello, Boston! Are you ready to humble yourself before God?
  [Crowd cheering]
  Emcee: What? Have you all taken a vow of silence? Come on!
  [Crowd cheering]
  Emcee: Then put your hands together for the one, the only His Holiness,
  the Pope!
  Peter: Hey, I just got a crazy idea! Augh! Why? Why? Why? Hey, I just
  got another crazy idea!
  Cardinal 1: Huh. Hey, did you ever notice this? On page 375, it says
  "Jebus."
  Cardinal 2: It's supposed to be "Jesus," right?
  Peter: Room service!
  Manager: We didn't order no room service.
  Peter: Actually I just wanted to check the honor bar. 'Cause uh, the
  last Pope we had here filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers.
  Manager: All right, wise guy, who are you?
  Peter: I'm just a faithful Catholic man with a family crisis only His
  Holiness can resolve. I've never asked the church for anything, but I
  don't know where else to turn.
  Cardinal 3: Dust him!
  Peter: Augh!
  Driver: My heavens, son! Are you okay?
  Peter: Yeah. I just got bounced by the Pope's road crew.
  Driver: It's good you missed me. I'm set to drive the Popemobile, and
  any slight bump on the head knocks me unconscious for a few hours. I
  always wake up feeling fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be
  knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this.
  [Crowd cheering]
  Luke: Taking it off here, Boss.
  Sheriff: Take it off there, Luke.
  Dragline: Wiping it off, Boss.
  Sheriff: Wipe it off, there, Dragline.
  Luke: Waving at the Pope here, Boss.
  Sheriff: Wave at the Pope there, Luke.
  The Pope: Are you sure this is Boston?
  Peter: Yeah, it's Boston. See, look, there's Harvard.
  The Pope: That's just a barn.
  Peter: Ooh, someone went to Yale.
  [Griffin house]
  Peter: Lois, put the coffee on.
  Lois: Careful. I just cleaned the floor.
  Peter: Good thing, huh?.
  The Pope: Mmmm, lemony.
  Lois: Your Holiness, this is such an honor. Please, go into the living
  room, and make yourself at home! Peter, what is the Pope doing here?
  Peter: Relax, honey. I just hijacked his bubble car so he can convince
  my dad I'm a good guy.
  Lois: You kidnapped the Pope? Peter, this is the most reckless thing
  you've ever done!
  Peter: Come on, Lois. What about the time I was on that airplane?
  [Peter on airplane]
  Peter: [Giggling]
  The Pope: Peter, you've raised a fine family.
  Peter: Yeah, well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up. Matter of fact, I was
  hoping you could change his mind. He'd have to believe you. You're
  God's go-to guy.
  The Pope: Well, your father is entitled to his opinion. But more
  important is what you think. Look deep in your heart, my son. Do you
  think you're a screw-up?
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Peter: No. I'm not. You know what? I'm a damn good father. And I have
  great kids.
  Meg: That's not what Grandpa says.
  Peter: Well, Grandpa is wrong. Meg, it's not a sin for a girl your age
  to like boys.
  Meg: Thanks, Daddy.
  Peter: And Chris, what you do in the bathroom is between you and God.
  And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you.
  Chris: Thanks, Dad!
  Lois: Good for you, Peter. But isn't there someone else you should
  speak to?
  Peter: Yes, there is. Scarecrow, you've had brains all along. Same goes
  for your heart, Tin Man. And Kristy McNichol, come back to television.
  We miss you.
  Lois: I meant you should talk to your father.
  Peter: You're right. You with me, big guy?
  The Pope: Peter, I go where I am needed.
  Peter: To the Popemobile!
  [Theme from Batman]
  Workers: [Desperate muttering]
  Peter: Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's
  birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it.
  Man: Wow, it's the Pope!
  Francis: Slothful sinners! You're here to work, not sit around with
  your.... Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father. I am not worthy.
  The Pope: Rise, my son. You are indeed worthy, for you have raised a
  fine son. His zest for life is an affirmation
  of God's great love within us all.
  Peter: Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope! So I guess you were
  wrong about me, huh, Dad?
  Francis: I was wrong all right.
  Peter: Stand by, boys.
  Francis: I was wrong about you! You've gone soft on me, Holy Father!
  Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist could tell this boy's no good!
  The Pope: Are you calling me a liar?
  Peter: Whoah, easy, Pontiff.
  The Pope: Because I'll excommunicate your sorry...
  Peter: Okay, time out.
  The Pope: Oh! I have never met such an infuriating man! You must have
  the patience of a saint.
  Peter: Well, he's my dad. And I just want him to love me.
  Francis: Peter, how could you say such a thing? I love you with all me
  heart.
  [Sentimental music playing]
  Peter: You do?
  Francis: Of course. I just don't like you. I don't like anything about
  you!
  [Music stops]
  Peter: Keep playing, you guys. I think this is as good as its going to
  get. Dad, to be honest, I don't like you, either. Aw, jeez, that's a
  terrible thing to say. I guess I am going to Hell.
  The Pope: Peter, the good Lord said to honor thy father. He never said
  anything about liking him.
  Peter: Well, in that case, Dad, I'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on
  Sundays, laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant
  wife. But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it.
  Francis: Well, fine. I'll be on me way. Take back your job, and give
  your old man a hug.
  Peter: I love you, Dad.
  Francis: I know you do, son.
  Peter: What are you gonna do now?
  Francis: I don't know. I guess the good Lord doesn't have much use for
  an old man like me.
  The Pope: Well...I suppose I could use another pair of hands on my tour.
  Peter: You'd give Dad a job, even knowing what a jerk he is?
  The Pope: I have to. As you said, Peter, "I am the freakin' Pope."
  [Crowd cheering on TV]
  Francis: All right, get back! No flash photography, or you'll go
  straight to Hell! You! You're in God's house, you heathen! Take that
  cap off before I take it off for you!
  Lois: Well, I think your father found the perfect job.
  Peter: Let's hope so. I love being a good father. But I don't want to
  have to be a good son again for a long, long time.
  [Knocking]
  Peter's Mom: Peter, open the door, and break out the schnapps! Guess
  who needs a place to sleep it off for the weekend?
  Peter: Mom!?
  Brian: Oh, my God, no!
  Peter: Quick, everyone! Into the pod!

Title: Da Boom

Theme Song
  Diane Simmons: And that concludes our special half-hour salute to the
  past 1,000 years.
  Tom Tucker: We leave you this New Year's Eve with a look back at some
  of those we've lost this millennium.
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Meg: Kevin asked me to Quagmire's millennium party! I am so psyched!
  Peter: There's nothing like a party at someone else's house. You never
  have to worry about cleaning.
  [Peter at party]
  Peter: [Chanting conga music]
  Chicken mascot: well, looks like someone's going to a big party
  tonight. You should pick up a chicken-strip party pack for all your
  friends. Here's a coupon.
  Peter: Whoa, whoa, look, pal. I don't take coupons from giant chickens.
  Not after last time.
  [Peter at checkout line]
  Peter: Oh, yeah. And that nice chicken outside gave me this coupon.
  Clerk: I'm sorry. This has expired.
  Peter: You son of a...
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Man 1: I'm gonna need these by Friday.
  Man 2: Ooh. Is that gonna give us enough time to crosscheck the...
  [Intense instrumental music]
  Peter: [panting] Chicken gave me a bad coupon.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  [back outside the market]
  Peter: Some other time, pal.
  Chicken Mascot: There won't be any other time. The world is gonna end
  at midnight tonight! Y2K!
  Peter: Y2K? What are you selling? Chicken or sex jelly?
  Chicken Mascot: Haven't you heard? At midnight, every computer in the
  world is gonna fail! Planes will fall out of the sky, and all the
  world's nuclear weapons will explode, annihilating the entire planet!
  Peter: No! Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids. Damn long-ears, trying to
  take Easter away from Jesus. Sorry. What were you saying?
  Cleveland: Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know, a balloon tied to a
  mailbox is the international symbol for "party over here"!
  Peter: Forget the party. The world's gonna end! Y2K! I heard it from a
  chicken-man.
  All: [Laughing]
  Cleveland: Oh, Peter, you are the height of just-too-mucherie.
  Peter: Well, laugh all you want. But when you die, you'll have to go to
  heaven. And you know what? You know what? I bet you run into those two
  dead bailiff ladies from Night Court. You're not gonna know which one
  is which. And it's going to be really awkward. So bite me.
  Brian: Hey, can you help me with these damn studs?
  Lois: Aren't you a little over-dressed?
  Brian: Oh, well, actually, I'm just stopping off at Quagmire's. There's
  a benefit gala at the Boston Pops tonight, and...well, I'm trying to
  nail the flautist.
  Lois: Oh, Stewie! You're adorable!
  Stewie: Yes, yes. I rather like the sash. But do the Huggies make my
  ass look big?
  Lois: Peter, come on! You've had 1,000 years to get ready for this
  party. It always takes him so long to get dressed.
  (Lois is in the bathroom wearing a violet-and-lavender striped dress.)
  Lois: Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you
  dressed yet?
  (Enter Peter wearing the same dress as Lois.)
  Peter: Oh, crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change. (Pause.)
  [sighs] Unzip me.
  Lois: Where's your father?
  Meg: He's still down in the basement.
  Lois: Peter, you've been down there all day. I hope you're already...
  [screams]
  Chris: Oh, my God! The government is here! Run, ET, run!
  ET: [Screaming]
  Peter: The end of the world is coming. Now, come on, get in your
  radiation suits.
  Lois: Peter, we are not missing a once-in-a-lifetime event because of
  some wacko doomsday theory.
  Peter: Okay. Okay. Hey, guys. You know that one Christmas present you
  really wanted, but didn't get?
  Meg: A phone?
  Chris: A pony?
  Brian: A humidor?
  Stewie: A dead Lois?
  Peter: Yeah. Well, it's in the basement. Come on. Let's go see.
  Meg: My own phone!
  Chris: I'm gonna name him Sparky.
  Lois: Peter, if you want to stay here, that's fine. But we're going to
  the party. Kids!
  Peter: Honey, are you pregnant?
  Lois: No.
  [Loud crashing]
  Stewie: Oh, dear me, yes, yes. This is how I wanted to enter the new
  millennium. Locked in a basement with imbeciles dressed like a gay Neil
  Armstrong.
  Brian: Thanks a lot, Peter. Right now, I could be in Boston, pretending
  I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi.
  Meg: Yeah, and I could be getting felt up by Kevin.
  Lois: Now, Meg, don't you give it all away up front. Make him work for
  it. And shame on you, Peter. Scaring the kids with your
  nuclear-holocaust nonsense.
  Peter: You said "nuclear." It's "nucular," dummy. The "s" is silent.
  Chris: It's almost midnight.
  Diane Simmons: We now go live to Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa.
  Tricia, what can you tell us?
  Tricia Takanawa: Diane, Quahog's fabled alabaster clam is about to
  descend and usher in a new millennium.
  Crowd: 10, 9, 8...
  Peter: This is it!
  Crowd: 6, 5, 4...
  Peter: Hold on tight!
  Crowd: 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year!
  [Cheering]
  ["Auld Lang Syne" playing]
  Brian: A flautist, Peter!
  Lois: Well, I hope you're happy. Come on, kids. We can still make the
  party if we...
  [Earth rumbling] [Whooshing] [crashing]
  Military Guy: Nice work, Lieutenant. Very festive.
  Lieutenant: Actually, sir, each of those lights represents a missile
  launching by itself. The pattern is just a coincidence.
  Military Guy: Oh, well, now that you mention it, the "Y" is a little
  misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing.
  [Explosion]
  Bill Clinton: Oh, what the hell. Come here, Hillary.
  Alien abductee: What did I miss?
  Peter: Holy crap! Anybody else feel that?
  [Griffin kitchen, post-apocalypse]
  Peter: Good morning, family. Hey, Lois, you remember when I was the
  third Hardy Boy?
  Lois: Peter, there was no third Hardy Boy.
  Peter: Oh, really? Just like there was no apocalypse? He shoots! He
  scores!
  [Crashing]
  Lois: Okay, we were wrong about the end of the world, and you were
  right. Can we please just drop it?
  Meg: It's just not fair. I finally get a date with Kevin, and he gets
  vaporized!
  Chris: He's just using that as an excuse. [Laughs]
  Lois: Let's just be grateful we survived the apocalypse healthy and
  mutation-free.
  Cleveland: I said I can do it.
  Quagmire: Hey, shut up!
  Peter: Hey, Clevemire.
  Quagmire: That's "Quagland."
  Cleveland: "Quagland?" Oh, you must be dreaming.
  Quagmire: Not about kicking your fat ass!
  Lois: Boys, please. You used to be so close.
  Cleveland: Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby, on account of the
  fact that neither one of us has had any food since we got fused
  together.
  Lois: Well, we just finished off what was left in the kitchen. When I
  think of all the food we've wasted in this house...
  [Peter attempting to feed television]
  Peter: Here, Tom Selleck. Come on. Down the hatch. Come on. Hey! Hey!
  None for you, Higgins! Trying to steal Tom Selleck's food! No. No!
  You've had yours!
  Lois: Thank goodness Peter bought a supply of dehydrated meals before
  the blast. Peter, what are you doing? You just ate a year's worth of
  food!
  Peter: What a waste of money. I'm still hungry.
  [Slushy oozing]
  Peter: Everyone leave. I have to poop. Now!
  Brian: Well, so much for finding food at the Stop 'N Shop.
  Peter: Figures. The one time I remember my Value Club Card.
  Brian: Wait a minute. I smell barbecue.
  [Gasping]
  Tom Tucker: So what do you think, Diane? Can I cook, or what?
  Diane Simmons: Mmm, delicious, Tom. I guess we should be eating her
  with chopsticks.
  Brian: Oh, my God! They're eating Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa.
  Peter: That's crazy. They're just gonna be hungry again in an hour.
  Chris: Come on, Woody. We're gonna search for food.
  Peter: Sorry, Chris. The plant can't come.
  Lois: It's his best friend.
  Peter: Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed. I'll take care of
  Woody, son.
  [Gunshot]
  Chris: What was that?
  Peter: Nothing. Let's go.
  Lois: Go where? If there's no food in Quahog what makes you think
  there's gonna be food anywhere else?
  Peter: Lois, everyone knows there are only two things that can survive
  a "nucular" holocaust cockroaches and Twinkies. And there's a Twinkie
  factory in Natick.
  Lois: Twinkies?
  Peter: Yeah. I saw a story about them on A&E.
  Announcer: And now back to A&E's Biography, "Twinkie the Kid."
  Greg Twinkee: [stammering] It was difficult for Twink to play with
  other children. He was different. He was definitely... He had no bones.
  And he couldn't really play any sports.
  Sheila Twinkee: Yeah. That's why, you know, we got him the lasso.
  Greg Twinkee: Yeah.
  Sheila Twinkee: He'd spend hours in the backyard, playing Wonder Woman.
  [Laughing] He's gonna kill me.
  Greg Twinkee: He loved that lasso. Not as much as the baton. But we put
  a stop to the baton. He was different enough, you know?
  Peter: We just gotta get to that Twinkie factory, and we'll have all
  the food we need.
  Lois: Well, good-bye, sweet home. Maybe someday we'll return.
  Peter: Hey, Joe, can you keep an eye on the place?
  Joe: I might as well. I'm melted to the ground.
  Meg: There you go, Mr. Swanson. These oughta keep the rats away.
  Joe: Thanks, hon. Stay in school!
  Mutant Rat: [Roaring]
  Joe Swanson: Bring it on!
  Lois: Look, Peter! People!
  Jorad: Halt!
  Peter: Uh-oh.
  Jorad: I am Jorad. I and my band of highway warriors control this
  territory. Do you have any food?
  Peter: Uh, no. That's why we're on the road.
  Jorad: Then you may not pass until you answer the following question.
  Name something you take on a picnic.
  Meg: Blankets.
  Brian: Potato salad.
  Chris: Chicken.
  Stewie: A dead Lois.
  Peter: Okay. We're gonna go with potato salad.
  Jorad: Show me "potato salad"!
  Peter: [Whispering] Maybe we should go now.
  [in car]
  Peter: Aw, jeez! Out of gas?
  Chris: Hey, Dad, look!
  Old Man: Well, howdy, strangers. You look plumb tuckered. Like to sit a
  spell?
  Lois: Actually, we are tired.
  Chris: And hungry.
  Old Man: Well, we got plenty of room here and all the fresh apples you
  can eat.
  Lois: Oh, Peter! We found a new home!
  Peter: What are you talkin' about? We're going to Natick!
  Meg: For what? A Twinkie factory that might not even exist anymore?
  Brian: She's right. Besides, this place is paradise.
  Old Man: Sure is. Except for Randy Newman.
  Peter: Randy Newman?
  Old Man: Yup. Just sits there all night and day singing about what he
  sees.
  [Playing piano]
  Randy Newman: ? Fat man with his kids and dog? ?Drove in through the
  mornin' fog? ?Hey there, Rover, come on over ?
  Lois: Well, it's nice to have music while we eat.
  Randy: ? Red-headed lady, reachin' for an apple? ?Gonna take a bite,
  nope, nope? ?She's gonna breathe on it first? ?Wipes it on her
  blouse...? ?She takes a bite, chews it once,? ?Twice, three times, four
  times, stops? ?Saliva workin'? ?She takes a long hard look at Randy?
  ?Five times? ?Fat old husband walkin over ?
  Lois: Let's get the hell out of here.
  Randy: ?Yeah, they're walkin' down the road? ?Left foot,right foot,left
  foot,right foot,left-- ?
  [Apple hits Randy in the head]
  Chris: ? Left foot, right foot? ?Left foot, right foot?
  Lois: Please, Chris, Mommy's going to have a big...
  Chris: ?Left foot, right foot? ?Left foot... ?
  Lois: Chris please... Stop it! Thank you sweetie. Now, Peter, we've got
  to find some food.
  Brian: Oh, my God! Look!
  Peter: It's Natick.
  All: [Cheering]
  Meg: There's no factory?
  Stewie: Ha! Very good, fat man! We follow the Pied Piper of Hamsteak to
  the gates of oblivion, and look what it's brought us! We're finished!
  We're done! Game over, man! Game over! Augh! Damn it!
  Lois: Stewie, get out of that nuclear waste! Who knows what animals
  have been in there?
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  [Cheering]
  Stewie: It's about damn time!
  Peter: No words...should have sent a poet.
  Brian: There's enough food to last us forever!
  Lois: Peter, we're saved! You were right. We can settle down here and
  build a house, just like we had in Quahog.
  Meg: Yeah! And we can build a mall, so I'll have a place to hang out!
  Chris: And two Denny's, so we can always say, "Let's not go to that
  one. Let's go to the good one."
  Lois: We can have Quagland get Joe out of the driveway. And we can
  build a community, just like the one we had.
  Peter: No! We'll build a better one. I hereby proclaim this city New
  Quahog!
  [Energy pulsating]
  Stewie: Well. This isn't very good, now, is it?
  [Cheerful instrumental music]
  Quagmire: [screaming]
  Chris: Guess who?
  Meg: Stop it, Chris.
  Chris: Wrong! Ha ha ha ha! Oh, wait. Did you say "Chris"?
  Lois: Stewie, time for breakfast! Did you wash your tentacles, my big
  handsome boy?
  Stewie: What the devil are you talking about? "Handsome." I'm
  repugnant! I'm a radio-bloody-active freak!
  Quagmire: Eh, I fold. Come on, let's go home and get tender with your
  wife.
  Cleveland: I don't know, Quagmire. Lovemaking with Loretta has somehow
  lost its intimacy.
  [bedroom with Loretta and Quagland]
  Quagmire: All right!
  Brian: Ah, excuse me, Mr. Mayor. We have an outsider who wishes to join
  our community.
  Peter: Welcome to my fair city! If you want to become a citizen, you
  have to get a job.
  Man: Well, before the disaster, I was a physician.
  Cleveland: That's terrific. We need a doctor.
  Peter: We sure do. Let's hope you get it. Now pick a job out of the
  hat. Ah, "Village idiot." That's a good one. On Tuesdays, you get to
  wave your penis at traffic. Congratulations.
  Joe: Peter, maybe we should've just let him be a doctor.
  Peter: No! These are the rules of New Quahog. Besides, that's how
  everyone else got their jobs.
  Old lady: Go! [Frantic screaming]
  Patient: You see, Doc, my back tooth is killing me. [screaming]
  Peter: And things have worked out fine so far.
  Cleveland: Peter, no offense, but that's because we all pitched in.
  Joe: That's right. We built schools, and hospitals.
  Brian: Yeah, not to mention the theater.
  [Brian on stage as Truman Capote]
  Brian: "But when I saw the movie, it looked like Audrey Hepburn not
  only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's, she hadn't eaten anything in a
  year. [hooting] I am such a bitch!"
  [back in office]
  Brian: We have everything we need. And no crime, no guns, no pollution.
  Peter: Brian's right. We've left ourselves defenseless. Guys, we need
  to make some guns.
  Cleveland: Guns? Guns only lead to trouble.
  Peter: Right. And when that trouble happens, we'll be ready to blow its
  freakin' head off! Besides, without guns how would our forefathers have
  settled their differences?
  Forefather: 8, 9, 10, and turn!
  Lois: Honey, Mommy's making you some new feetie pajamas. And look, it
  has a little trap door for when you gotta make inky.
  Stewie: I'll show you inky!
  Lois: Let's see if they fit, mmm?
  Stewie: Never! [Mocking laughter] Look at me! I'm Fred Astaire! Ah!
  Lois: Gotcha. Oh, you are getting heavy. I'll gonna have your father
  flood the basement so you can get some more exercise.
  Stewie: Yes, yes, I do seem to have gained a bit of girth. Actually, my
  gullet seems to be rumbling. [Grunting] There we are. Oh, I say. I've
  laid an egg! Well, that wasn't so bad. I don't know what these women
  are always complaining about... Augh!
  Peter: Attention, New Quahogians. Today my vision for our future comes
  true. A chicken in every pot, and a cap in every ass!
  Lois: Peter, put that away! Where did you get the metal for all those
  guns?
  Peter: Recycling. I used the pipes from our irrigation system.
  Woman: Are you crazy? You destroyed all our water pipes?
  Man 1: We don't need guns! We need food and water!
  Man 2: I have a canker sore on my lip! And I keep poking at it with my
  tongue! But that's only making it worse!
  Peter: There's a reason I'm in charge here, all right? I knew the world
  was gonna end. I'm the one who found the Twinkie factory and started
  this town. And I'm the one who gave elocution lessons to Rosie Perez.
  Man 1: That's nothing to be proud of!
  Peter: [Imitating Rosie Perez] Don't be stupid! She speak good and
  everything!
  Crowd: Let's get him! Throw him out!
  Lois: Wait! We can work this out!
  Peter: Jeez, I haven't been thrown out of any place since I was a
  counselor at the bulimia clinic.
  [Peter at clinic]
  Peter: Aw, man, did anybody else throw up after eating that fish last
  night?
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Man 1: That's the last of them!
  Man 3: Good riddance! What the hell would we ever need guns for?
  Stewie: Victory is ours.
  [Citizens screaming]
  Man 1: Quick! Grab the guns! They're our only hope!
  Man 4: Hey, Bob. You remember the other day, you asked me what the
  definition of "irony" was, and I said...
  [screaming]
  [Explosions]
  Peter: Honey, I'm sorry I got us kicked out of New Quahog. I guess
  nobody really needs guns. I'm not always right, after all.
  Lois: Oh, Peter. Hearing you say that almost makes it worth having the
  world blown up.
  Meg: Where are we gonna go?
  Peter: I hear there's a Carvel factory in Framingham.
  Chris: All right! Fudgie the Whale! And Cookie Puss! And Cookie O'Puss!
  And Nutty the Chocolate Ghost!
  Lois: Come on, everybody. Let's sing a song.
  Chris: ? Left foot, right foot?
  All: ?left foot, right foot?

  Pam: Bobby!

  Pam: Oh, Bobby. I just had the weirdest dream. I dreamt I saw the
  strangest episode of Family Guy. And there was a giant chicken! And
  Stewie was an octopus.
  Bobby: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on now. It's all right. Everything's
  gonna be okay. What's Family Guy?

Title: Brian in Love

[music a la the theme from "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"]
  Mr. Rogers: Hello, neighbor. I'm glad we're together again.
  [Bell rings]
  Mr. Rogers: Oh! I think I hear our friend Trolley.
  Stewie: Actually, it's your mortal enemy, Stewie.
  Mr. Rogers: What the...
  Stewie: I wouldn't bother visiting the Neighborhood of Make-believe
  today, Mr. Rogers. I dare say, you'll find it quite in ruin.
  Mr. Rogers: What?
  Henrietta Pussycat: Meow, meow, meow, skin graft. Meow, meow, meow,
  meow.
  Mr. Rogers: Oh, my God!
  Stewie: That's right, all dead. And now, Mr. Rogers...Fred. May as well
  drop the bloody formalities, I'm going to kill you anyway.
  Mr. Rogers: No, please. Don't!
  Stewie: How ironic. "Rogers." It almost rhymes with: "eliminate."
  Mr. Rogers: No!
  Stewie: What, what? What the devil?
  Lois: It's okay, Stewie. You were just talking in your sleep.
  Mr. Rogers: But now it's time for you to meet Mr. Death.
  Stewie: Aaugh!
  Theme Song
  [Theme from The Jetsons]
  George Jetson: Help! Jane! Stop this crazy thing! Stop! Help!
  Jane Jetson: Oh, my God! George!
  George Jetson: Did you not hear me out there?
  Elroy Jetson: Dad, are you...
  George Jetson: Go to your room, Elroy.
  Elroy Jetson: But what happened?
  George Jetson: Go to your room! For 45 minutes I was out there
  screaming. I know that because my damn watch is broken.
  Jane Jetson: I'm sorry.
  George Jetson: Oh, "I'm sorry!" "I'm sorry!" Jane is sorry! I could've
  been killed!
  Chris: So, uh, what are you wearing? Wow! I bet you could see right
  through that.
  Lois: Chris, who are you talking to?
  Chris: Grandma.
  Lois: Oh, no!
  Brian: What is it?
  Lois: It looks like Stewie had an accident on the carpet.
  Brian: Oh, Lois, again?
  Lois: That baby just does not want to keep his diaper on.
  Stewie: Here you are! What the hell is this?
  Lois: Sweetie, that's tuna salad.
  Stewie: Oh, is that what it is? Really? Because I could have sworn it
  was mayonnaise and cat food! Here's 50 cents. Do me a favor,
  sweetheart. The next time you're out shopping, why don't you splurge on
  a tin of solid white albacore?
  Lois: Stewie, are you upset because you went wee-wee on the carpet?
  Stewie: What did you just say?
  Peter: Hey, Lois, I...hey, did you pee in here?
  Stewie: In a moment! What did you just say?
  Lois: Peter, we have a serious problem we need to discuss.
  Peter: Aw, jeez. This isn't another one of those interventions, is it?
  [Griffin kitchen]
  Lois: Peter, you've been wearing that giant foam cowboy hat for eight
  months now. Please, for your family, take it off.
  Peter: Hey. Hey, I can take this hat off anytime I want. I just don't
  want to. Get away!
  [living room]
  Lois: No, it's Stewie. He peed on the carpet.
  Peter: Do I-do I hit him?
  Lois: No!
  Stewie: Bend down, Mother.
  Lois: Yes, honey?
  Stewie: How dare you sully my good name by spreading your slanderous
  filth!
  Lois: Stewie, no hitting! Use your words.
  Brian: Oh, he's probably just ashamed, Lois. You're just a helpless
  little carpet tinkler, aren't you?
  Stewie: Well! The outrages I have suffered today will not be soon
  forgotten! I will not be forgetting those outrages! No, no! No, they
  won't be forgotten! Not the...
  Brian: "Outrages," yeah. I think we got it.
  Stewie: Ah!
  Lois: Maybe it's time for Stewie to start potty training.
  Peter: Isn't he a little young for that? You know what happened to the
  Lindbergh baby.
  Mrs. Lindbergh: Charles, he's only 6 months old.
  Charles Lindbergh: Honey, would you relax? God, I flew across the
  Atlantic by myself. I'm a national treasure, for God's sake. I think I
  know how to...ah! Oh, God! Oh, God! All right. He was kidnapped. You
  call the police. I'll write the ransom note.
  Mrs. Lindbergh: What about Amelia? She saw everything!
  Charles Lindbergh: You leave her to me.
  Lois: Come on, honey. He's been having accidents. Maybe he's trying to
  tell us he's ready. This could be a nice way for you and Stewie to bond.
  Peter: Bond? James Bond. All right, Lois. I'll do it!
  Brian: Oh, God. Not again, Brian. Why can't you stop peeing on the
  carpet? Damn it! It's not coming out.
  Lois: Brian, is that you?
  Brian: Uh, yeah. It's me.
  Lois: Is everything okay?
  Brian: Yeah, yeah. I couldn't sleep. I'll be up in a minute.
  Lois: Okay.
  Brian: [disgusted sigh]
  Bob Barker: Join us tomorrow for more Price is Right. This is Bob
  Barker reminding you to help control the pet population. Have your pets
  spayed or neutered.
  Brian: Oh, just die, already.
  Meg: Mom, Stewie peed on the rug again!
  Brian: No!
  Lois: Oh, this has gotta stop.
  Meg: God! It smells gross.
  Brian: well, Princess, I don't see anyone dabbing yours behind their
  ears.
  Lois: That's odd. It looks like someone already tried to clean it up.
  Brian: No, it doesn't.
  Chris: Mine smells like soda.
  Peter: Yeah, I'm looking for toilet-training books.
  Clerk: Oh, yes. We can help you there. "Everybody Poops" is still the
  standard, of course. We've also got the less popular "Nobody Poops But
  You."
  Peter: Huh. Well, see, we're Catholic, so...
  Clerk: Then you want "You're a Naughty Child And That's Concentrated
  Evil Coming Out the Back of You."
  Peter: Perfect!
  Lois: Brian, what are you doing?
  Brian: Oh, hi, Lois. I was just washing some things.
  Lois: Those look like our sheets and our quilt.
  Brian: They are. I'm washing them in some fabric softener, because last
  night they were so itchy, I couldn't sleep. Which is why I was
  downstairs when you asked me if everything was okay and I said I
  couldn't sleep. You know, because it was so itchy.
  Peter: Come on, Stewie. Don't you want to pee in a toilet bowl, like a
  big boy? I remember when I learned to use a potty all by myself. I was
  so proud.
  [current-aged Peter in living room]
  Peter: Hey, Lois! I did it!
  [back to bathroom]
  Stewie: Well, perhaps I could give it the old college try. Why don't
  you put your hands right there? It'll help me relax.
  Peter: Okay, buddy. Augh! Maybe you don't have to pee. Hey, I oughta
  give you beer. It goes right through you.
  Stewie: Wonderful, and while we're at it, we could light up a doobie
  and watch porn.
  Peter: Y-yeah?
  Stewie: Listen, you, I'll use these facilities when I'm damn well
  ready. Until then, you shall continue to sanitize my crevasse and be
  damn grateful for the opportunity! Starting right...[grunting]. Well
  not now. But soon!
  Peter: Oh, oh, and I want these, and these, and these.
  Lois: Only one.
  Peter: But that man over there got two!
  Lois: Peter, I don't care what the other men are getting. You're only
  getting one.
  Peter: I hate you! Hey, what's that sound?
  Stewie: You're urinating! So, it's been you all along! Oh, this is too
  perfect! I've been taking the blame for Rex.
  Meg: Ew, it's everywhere!
  Lois: It's okay. Meg, hand me my sweater.
  Peter: Jeez, Brian, where do you think you are? Payless?
  Stewie: I say, I say, Paco, grab a mop. For God's sake, could somebody
  get Patches the hell out of here before he decides to bend a fresh
  biscuit on the conveyor belt?
  Lois: It's okay. We'll meet you in the parking lot.
  Brian: Oh, God, Lois. I need help.
  [Quahog Medical Center; pychologist's office]
  Brian: Look, I really don't even know why I'm here. The urologist said
  I was fine.
  Dr. Kaplan Well, sometimes these things can be psychological.
  Brian: Doubt that! I mean, I've got a very comfortable life. I live
  with a great family. All my needs are met. Okay, look. So, maybe this
  isn't where I thought I was gonna be at 7 years old. It's just that
  I.... God, is it okay if I smoke in here? Thanks. It's just that things
  don't always work out the way we plan. Do you know I've never been to
  Europe? Now look at me. Middle-aged, alone, and peeing in supermarkets.
  Man, didn't see that coming. I had this dream last night. Did you ever
  see Logan's Run?
  Intercom: Last day. Capricorn 2537. Our next dedication goes out to
  Tommy from Kim.
  ["All Out of Love" by Air Supply over PA system]
  [Tense sci-fi instrumental music]
  Man: We've got a runner in Sector G.
  Brian: What about him? He's gotta be in his 50s.
  [back in office]
  Brian: So what do you think?
  Dr. Kaplan: I think you're very sensitive, and you put up a tough
  front. I think you're in pain.
  Brian: Damn it, Brian, do not cry.
  Dr. Kaplan: I'd like to pet you, Brian. Would that be okay? You're a
  good dog, Brian. A very good...
  Brian: Keep it above the waist, Doc.
  Tom Tucker: And now part two of our very own Asian correspondent Tricia
  Takanawa's special report on sex.
  Tricia Takanawa: Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom of Judy and Glen
  Isaacs. Ten years married and still in love. What's their secret? Judy
  has an inoperable brain tumor the size of my fist. And that just
  happens to be Glen's fetish.
  Lois: Brian, how'd it go?
  Brian: Well, Lois, I think I have little bit of "me work" to do. But
  I'm feeling things, and that's a start.
  Lois: Oh, that's wonderful. You know, like most other people, I used to
  think therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs. Isn't that silly?
  Peter: Hey, Lois, I...hey, Brian. How you doing? They let you out
  already?
  Brian: I was in a therapy session, not a lunatic asylum.
  Peter: Hey, hey, hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have gone on to
  lead normal, successful lives.
  Lois: What did your therapist say?
  Brian: Dr. Kaplan thinks the "accidents" are linked to some kind of
  mid-life crisis. He suggests I go out into the world and pursue my
  dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow.
  Parachutist: Whoops. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. I gave you one
  of the ones with silverware in it. Take this one instead. That one's
  probably fine.
  Brian: Beautiful.
  Man: Augh!
  Brian: Oh, my God! Are you Stephen King?
  Man: No. I'm Dean Koontz.
  Brian: Oh.
  [Engine starts]
  Man: [Gurgling]
  Brian: But, you know, thanks to these sessions, I think I'm okay. Being
  out in the world, feeling my power, and no accidents! I've been dry for
  two weeks now.
  Dr. Kaplan: Mazel tov.
  Brian: Well, good-bye, Dr. Kaplan. And thank you.
  Tom Tucker: Look, I know Stacy isn't your mother but upside-down face
  or not, you have to respect her.
  Brian: Hey, you're Tom Tucker...[yelps]
  Jake Tucker: Hey!
  Brian: Oh, God. That was rude. I apologize. Wow.
  Stewie: [Urinating] ? I'm a little teapot short and stout? ?Here is my
  handle, here is my spout? ?When I get all steamed up, hear me shout?
  Lois, it looks as if Puddles has done it again! Goodness, he's wet
  everything. [laughter]
  Brian: I-I swear, I don't even remember doing it. I don't understand
  this.
  Lois: Now, Brian, we know you're not doing this on purpose. But maybe
  we should consider...crating.
  Brian: Oh, God.
  Peter: Or you could be an outside dog. Eh? Would you like that? Eh?
  Outside?
  Brian: And how embarrassed was I when the word "crate" came up? I
  thought I was past this. I traveled the world, for God's sake. Do you
  know how much I spent?
  Dr. Kaplan: Well, obviously we haven't hit the real issue yet. Drop it.
  Tell me, Brian, the last accident you remember, did anything unusual
  happen that might've triggered it?
  Brian: No, no. It was a normal day.
  [Peter washing the car]
  Peter: Oh, Catwoman.
  Lois: Peter, no "Catwoman" today. I'm tired.
  Peter: What's the matter? Is the mighty Catwoman afraid of a little
  Catwoman melting spray?
  Lois: Peter, no.
  Peter: Come on.
  Lois: All right. Okay. Enough, Batman. I don't want...
  Peter: Not so mighty now, are you, Catwoman?
  Lois: Peter!
  Peter: Take that. I spit water on you.
  Lois: Peter! Batman, I can't breathe! Peter! I'm using my special cat
  power to get Batman all wet.
  Peter: Hey, knock it off.
  Lois: [meowing]
  Brian: You know, just the usual stuff. Wait a minute. All that running
  water. That's gotta be it!
  Dr. Kaplan: Mmm-hmm. Brian, tell me about Lois.
  Brian: Lois. Well, she's a fantastic woman. She's compassionate and
  charming, attractive. Well, stunning, really. I guess you could say I
  really...
  Dr. Kaplan: Love her?
  Brian: No, of course not! Me and Lois? That's sick! I mean, come on.
  She's my best friend's wife.
  Dr. Kaplan: Mmm-hmmm.
  Brian: Look, I love Lois, but I'm not in love with her.
  Dr. Kaplan: Who are you trying to convince, Brian? Me or you?
  Brian: Oh, Brian, Brian, what a mess. Don't get antsy. I got three
  minutes left.
  Peter: So, what the hell, Brian? You cured yet? 'Cause, you know, I
  don't want to have to live in a house with plastic on the furniture
  like some Italian family.
  Brian: My therapist thinks he's figured out what my problem is.
  Peter: Oh, yeah? What does Sigmund "Fraud" think it is?
  Brian: He thinks I'm in love.
  Peter: Oh, my God! You can talk!
  Brian: [lengthy pause] Never mind.
  Peter: Well, does this girl love you back?
  Brian: I can't imagine.
  Peter: You gotta find out for sure. You don't want to spend your life
  wondering what could have been.
  Waiter: Sir, I need a decision.
  Peter: Uh, uh, salad. No, wait! Soup!
  [back in living room]
  Peter: But it was too late. And to this day, I still lay awake at night
  wondering about the soup that got away.
  Brian: Thanks, Peter. I'm gonna go find out how she feels.
  Man: I've taken you for granted.
  Peter: Oh, get a room!
  Lois: Hey, you. The news is on.
  Brian: Where is everybody?
  Lois: Stewie's taking a nap, and Peter and the kids are out. Come sit
  with me.
  Brian: O-okay. [shuddering]
  Diane Simmons: And now part three of Asian correspondent Tricia
  Takanawa's special report on sex.
  Tricia Takanawa: Thank you, Diane. Sex. Some people have it
  anonymously. What kind of person would do that, you might ask? Well,
  I'm about to find out. I just picked up a complete stranger in a hotel
  bar and he's in the bathroom right now, possibly doing drugs. Watch as
  I have sex with this potentially dangerous man as we take you in-depth
  and undercover.
  Quagmire: I've never had a Spanish chick before. O-lé!
  Lois: It is so refreshing to see something other than violence on the
  news. Brian, your tail keeps hitting me.
  Brian: If it's bothering you, I can stop.
  Lois: No, it's okay. The breeze feels good. It's so warm in here. Ooh,
  that's better.
  Brian: I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my
  skin. [awkward laughter] [to self:]Smooth.
  Lois: Well, I'd better go start dinner.
  Stewie: Well, well, well!
  Brian: How long have you been there?
  Stewie: I came along about the time you started pummeling her with your
  tail.
  Brian: You shut up!
  Stewie: You love her! Ha! Oh, this is so good, it just has to be
  fattening.
  Brian: I said, shut up!
  Stewie: Oh, by the way, nice rap. "I'd take my sweater off, but I'm
  afraid it's attached to my skin." Ha ha ha! Imbecile!
  Meg: Then, Brittany and Amber were like, "Let's go to the mall." And I
  was like, "Okay, I'll go to the mall." But then Amber wasn't gonna go,
  so I went to the mall. And you're not gonna believe it-they both showed
  up!
  Peter: Hold on. Meg, Meg. I'm sorry. That is a really boring story. I
  haven't been this bored since that stupid drive-in movie.
  [drive-in; Peter's car facing the wrong way]
  Peter: This sucks.
  [back in dining room]
  Brian: Lois, this pasta, better than Italy.
  Lois: It's just my Noodle Caboodle. I did use a different brand of
  potato chips for the crust, though.
  Brian: Your culinary prowess is surpassed only by your unfailing grace
  and the uncommon, sometimes haunting glow of sensuality that surrounds
  you.
  Lois: It's just Noodle Caboodle.
  Peter: Hey, what are these hard things?
  Lois: M&Ms. I ran out of paprika.
  Brian: [blows kiss] Magnificent.
  Stewie: Up. Up. Stewie wants to go uppie!
  Lois: You want me to pick you up, sweetie?
  Stewie: Mmm, Momma's skin's so soft.
  Lois: My goodness, you're affectionate tonight. Well, let me give my
  big boy a kiss.
  Stewie: Another! Another! Yes! Momma has candy kisses!
  Brian: All right, that's enough! I mean, would you all excuse me,
  please?
  Lois: Stewie...did you unhook Mommy's bra?
  Brian: Uh, hi.
  Lois: Well, hello, Brian.
  Brian: I think we should talk.
  Lois: Sure.
  Brian: Lois, did your heart ever want to ask something, but your head
  was too afraid of what the answer might be?
  Lois: Oh. Oh, God. Sometimes it's best not to ask those questions.
  Sometimes we should cherish what we already have. Like a very special
  friendship, let's say like the one you and I share that someone like me
  wouldn't change for anything in the world.
  Brian: Someone like me wouldn't change it for anything in the world
  either.
  Lois: I'm glad.
  Brian: Okay, just to be clear, we were talking about me being in love
  with you, and you rejecting me, right?
  Lois: Yes.
  Brian: Just making sure. Say we were both drunk, and we knew we
  wouldn't remember?
  Lois: Well, I'd have to be really, really...no!
  Brian: I tell you, Peter, I wish I'd taken this up years ago.
  Peter: Yeah, you know, my great-great-great uncle, Angus Griffin,
  invented the game.
  Angus Griffin: So, we're all clear on the rules then? No Jews and no
  blacks.
  All: Aye!
  Peter: Whoa, you're like the Arnold Palmer of golf.
  Brian: Yeah, life is good. I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards
  right I've got another seven years ahead of me.
  Peter: Hey, what ever happened to your lady friend?
  Brian: We decided to stay good friends. I found out that there are
  different kinds of love, and ours was perfect the way it was.
  Peter: So she dumped you, huh? Ah, the hell with her! She'll probably
  end up with some idiot. Serves her right. Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn.
  Mulligan. Damn.
  [closing theme music]



Title: Love Thy Trophy

Diane Simmons: Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons. A stunning development
  tonight, as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent. We have the identity of
  the real killer. But first...
  Tom Tucker: It's fall! The time of year when the leaves turn that
  pretty, purpley-orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest
  Festival Parade.
  Diane Simmons: Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa joins us live from the
  ceremony where they're choosing this year's theme.
  Tricia Takanawa: Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves. Gently
  tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by
  ordinary citizens of Quahog. And here to pick this year's winning theme
  is "Ten Commandments" star, Charlton Heston.
  Charlton Heston: Let my pigeons go!
  [Wings flapping]
  [Gun loading] [gunshot]
  Tricia Takanawa: He nailed one! We have our theme!
  Cleveland: I submitted "togetherness." A simple theme. But powerful,
  nonetheless.
  Joe: Come on, "overcoming adversity"! Let's go, "overcoming adversity"!
  Quagmire: Show me "women I gave the clap to"! Oh!
  Charlton Heston: And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: "The episode
  of 'Who's the Boss?' where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower."
  Peter: Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable! [Cheering]
  Stewie: Oh! Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley must be turning over in his
  grave. Wait a minute. He's not dead...yet. "Michael Flatley."
  Lois: Peter, it's great they picked your theme, but isn't it a little
  esoteric?
  Peter: Esoteric?
  [conference room inside Peter's brain]
  Man 1: Could it mean "sexy"?
  Man 2: I think it's a science term.
  Man 3: Fellas, fella, esoteric means "delicious."
  Peter: Lois, "Who's the Boss?" is not a food.
  Brian: Swing and a miss.
  Theme Song
  Meg: I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse!
  Peter: What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched
  her-
  Lois: Peter! Honey, what happened?
  Meg: Well, it was lunchtime and...
  Girl 1: I love the color of your Prada bag.
  Girl 2: Yeah, but yours has that great clasp.
  Girl 1: Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch? Oh, you know what? There's
  no room in my car for your big, ugly purse.
  [Girls laughing]
  Mrs. Canner: Meg, let me tell you about popularity.
  Girl 1: Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?
  Mrs. Canner: Bye!
  Meg: Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag.
  Peter: I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10?
  Meg: More like $1,100.
  Peter: [Laughing] You wish I loved you that much!
  Meg: [Sighs]
  Peter: We're never gonna get this float done in time for the parade.
  Pick up the pace, guys!
  Joe: Peter, your theme is a dud.
  Cleveland: Yeah. I've never even seen "Who's the Boss?"
  Quagmire: Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00...and home
  by 11:00. Oh!
  Peter: But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's
  the boss. It's not Tony or Angela. It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's
  all of us. Quagmire, you're the boss because you never give up, like
  with the ladies.
  Quagmire: Gemini. Augh! Capricorn. Augh! Well, I know you're not a
  Virgo! Augh!! Hey, from down here, you look like a Pisces! Augh!!!
  Peter: And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to
  detail. Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots,
  I just want to crack you with a cue stick. But I don't because that
  would be a hate crime, and I love you. And Joe, I've had new neighbors
  before, but none of them were half the man you are. And since you're
  half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't
  even measure.
  Joe: Peter's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's
  in?
  Quagmire: Go, Spooner Street!
  [Heroic instrumental music]
  Kevin: My dad always says, "Measure twice, cut once."
  Cleveland, Jr.: My daddy always says, "Cleveland, Jr., quit jumping on
  the bed!" [Laughing]
  Kevin: We didn't measure! We didn't measure!
  Brian: Amazing, Peter, you've inspired the whole neighborhood to work
  together.
  Peter: You know what's really amazing, Brian? I haven't brushed my
  teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing.
  Meg: Hey, Stewie, if I had a job, I could buy the bag myself.
  Stewie: Hmmm. I squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats
  video! Perhaps I should seek employment. Mother teaches piano; I
  suppose I could as well.
  [Stewie at piano bench with kid]
  Stewie: All right, try it again, Richard. And remember, the wrong keys
  are electrified.
  ["Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" misplayed] [Electric shock]
  Richard: Augh! I don't want to play the piano!
  Stewie: Indeed. Would you rather play the bassoon?
  Girl: [Playing bassoon] [Screams]
  Flappy: No experience? No, thanks.
  Lois: [Sighs]
  Waitress: [Whispering]
  Flappy: Oh, nuts. Young lady! What's the little guy's name?
  Meg: What do you care?
  Flappy: Well, I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street
  without a job.
  Meg: Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.
  Stewie: [spits out cookie]
  Diane Simmons: Welcome to the 83rd annual Quahog Harvest Festival
  Parade. Are you as excited as I am, Tom?
  Tom Tucker: Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...and clipped onto
  this piece of wood is a list of this year's float entries.
  Diane Simmons: Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme
  wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.
  Tom Tucker: And here's our first float.
  Diane Simmons: Oh, looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street.
  That's not Angela. That's Mona, Angela's mom.
  Tom Tucker: Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though.
  Diane Simmons: Mmm-hmm.
  Tom Tucker: This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. Well, that's just
  plain wrong.
  Diane Simmons: Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of
  them-
  Tom Tucker: Oh, baby! Look at that!
  Joe: Peter, the float turned out great.
  Peter: Yeah, our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire
  figured out how to get us free cable.
  Cleveland: We are not bad people. We just don't want to pay $12 a month
  for Cinemax.
  Diane Simmons: First place goes to Spooner Street.
  All: [Cheering] We won! All right! [Uncomfortable laughter]
  Loretta: Come on now! This is damn foolish!
  Peter: My theme, my trophy!
  Quagmire: My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself, Peter! I'm the boss!
  Cleveland: Well, he said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland
  got his due.
  Bonnie: Joe, my feet are starting to swell.
  Joe: You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes. You'd be
  amazed how little you have to eat when your legs don't work.
  Peter: There's only one way to settle this. Russian Roulette. Three
  bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first. No, no, no, wait
  a minute, this is crazy. You first.
  Brian: Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy
  the trophy.
  Peter: Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again!
  Lois: Perfect, Peter. Now we can all enjoy it.
  [Muttering approval]
  Cleveland: Here's to togetherness!
  Peter: Car. Car! Car!
  [Car approaching]
  Flappy: Meg, order up!
  Waitress: Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.
  Stewie: I don't care if they're from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!
  Waitress: Try them. You'll like them.
  Stewie: Yes, well, I rather doubt that. I-oh. Yes! These are
  delectable. Flappy, good news! I've decided not to kill you!
  Woman: What a precious little boy.
  Meg: Oh, that's my-uh, son.
  Woman: Your son? But you're just a baby yourself. Henry, give the
  little skank a nice tip.
  Meg: $20! Welcome to Flappy's. Why don't you have a seat next to my
  little baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support.
  Stewie: [Belching] Ha!
  Peter: [Horrified scream]
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Lois: Peter, what is it?
  Cleveland: What's going on out here?
  Joe: Clear the way! I'm a cop! Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on.
  I'm so sorry.
  Charlton Heston: That's okay, son. It's your right as an American
  citizen. [moaning]
  Quagmire: What's all the noise, boys? I was just jerk-ed out of a sound
  sleep.
  Cleveland: Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of
  our Golden Clam?
  Quagmire: Maybe it fell.
  Peter: Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.
  Bonnie: You think one of us stole it?
  Peter: I never said the word "stole." Looks like someone has a guilty
  conscience.
  Joe: Guilty conscience! Ha! I'm the only guy on this block who actually
  pays for his cable.
  Bonnie: Oooh.
  Cleveland: Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag
  out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!
  ALL: Oooh.
  Quagmire: You're one to talk. Out there every trash day picking through
  my garbage. That's an invasion of my privacy.
  ALL: Oooh.
  Loretta: He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth.
  If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the damned time, you
  could do it yourself, like the law says you should.
  ALL: Oooh.
  Peter: Oh, it's on now!
  Joe: Wait a second! What about Peter? He's the one who wanted the
  trophy all along!
  Peter: I couldn't have stolen it. Last night I was stealing Joe's
  ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight.
  Lois: Peter!
  Peter: What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch
  off a dead guy.
  Bonnie: Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe. Real oddballs. I
  don't trust them.
  Lois: I saw them taking coupons out of our mailbox.
  Quagmire: I don't like the look of her!
  Rod Serling: I offer you a recipe. Combine one part small-town
  neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is
  a gumbo fit only for a madman. A gumbo served almost exclusively in The
  Twi-
  Peter: Who the hell is that? I bet he took it!
  Joe: Where are you going, Serling? Want some of this?
  Quagmire: Come back here!
  Meg: Well, I'm off to work.
  Peter: Okay, honey. One of our neighbors took that trophy, Lois, and
  I'm gonna find out who.
  Meg: I'm taking Stewie with me again.
  Lois: Fine, sweetie. This whole thing just makes me sick!
  Peter: For crying out loud, we played Pictionary with them!
  Lois: Bastards!
  Stewie: Giddy-up, you stubby little mare! To the pancake house! Hiya!
  Meg: Well, bye.
  Lois: And to think they used to be our best friends!
  Peter: That was then and this is now! And this is a chair. And that's a
  lamp. And you have boobies. And I'm gonna find that trophy!
  Joe: Well, to be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you
  invited us over.
  Peter: Well, we realized our friendship is a lot more important than
  some stupid trophy.
  [Kettle whistling]
  Peter: Oh, there's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right,
  Bonnie? [forced laughter]
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Peter: Damn, it's not here!
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Peter: Not here either.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music] ['60s lounge music on stereo]
  Peter: Huh. Nothing.
  Lois: Oh, my God! We were robbed!
  Peter: Is anything missing?
  Lois: No. I don't think so. Hey, where's that picture of me in my
  two-piece at the Cape?
  Chris: Should I call the cops?
  Peter: No, I'm guessing a cop may have had something to do with this.
  Or a pilot. Or a deli owner. Okay, you dirtbags! This means war!
  Lois: Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security.
  Peter: Do you guys have those round metal things that you bury in the
  ground and, when stepped on, they explode?
  Clerk: Land mines?
  Peter & Lois: Land mines.
  Peter: It was land mines.
  Peter: Quagmire.
  Quagmire: Peter.
  Joe: Cleveland.
  Cleveland: Joe.
  Lois: Bonnie.
  Bonnie: Lois.
  Quagmire: Cleveland.
  Joe: Lois.
  Cleveland: Bonnie.
  Lois: Quagmire.
  Bonnie: Peter.
  Loretta: [Clears throat]
  Cleveland: Loretta.
  Lois: Come on, Peter.
  Peter: That ought to slow them down.
  Meg: Being a single mother is hard. But the real challenge is having a
  baby that's addicted to crack. Right, Stewie?
  Stewie: What's that? Oh, yes. I love crack. I'm absolutely coo-coo for
  crack!
  Meg: This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in
  three weeks. Well, here's your check. God bless.
  Waitress: Here, honey.
  Stewie: What's this? Blueberries? Oh, my.... Oh, that's better than sex!
  Sandy Balfour: Oh, and could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to
  help her baby.
  Lois: What are they up to?
  Peter: Well, Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I
  haven't seen Joe all day.
  Joe: Freeze!
  Kevin: Dad?
  Joe: Careful. There's a bear trap two feet to your right.
  Kevin: Thanks, Dad.
  Joe: Look out for your mother!
  Bonnie: There's a sandwich on the counter, honey.
  Loretta: Cleveland, these lobster traps aren't going to catch any
  intruders.
  Cleveland: Yes, they will. I baited them with these plump and tasty
  Fenway franks.
  Cleveland, Jr. Daddy, we got one! Daddy, we got one! Ha ha! Fat boy
  smelled a hot dog. Couldn't help it. Went right in. [Laughing]
  [Classical instrumental music]
  Sandy Balfour: Hello.
  Quagmire: Hey, get the hell off my...well, hello, lips, legs, breasts,
  and ass.
  Sandy Balfour: Yes. I was hoping I could ask you about your neighbors,
  the Griffins.
  Quagmire: The Griffins! A bunch of card-carrying Commies if you ask me!
  All right. No! No, no! It's not all right!
  Cleveland, Jr. Hey, fat boy!
  Cleveland: The Griffins are not to be trusted.
  Loretta: Mmm-mmm.
  Joe: Those people are nothing but vile, cheating, lying scum.
  Bonnie: And their carpet and drape scheme...[finger down throat]
  Stewie: No! No, I won't! Get that puree of loathsomeness away from me!
  Lois: But you love mashed turkey and peas.
  Stewie: I'm sorry. What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
  Did you just tell me what I love? Hmm? Write this down, you toad-faced
  frump. I love pancakes!
  Sandy Balfour: Hi, little fella. Is Meg Griffin here?
  Lois: No, she's not.
  Sandy Balfour: Probably out scoring more rock. Sandy Balfour, Child
  Services. We're placing this baby in a foster home.
  Lois: What?
  Stewie: For God's sake, feed me!
  Sandy Balfour: Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow? What an awful home
  for a child!
  Lois: How dare you! This is a wonderful home!
  [Gunshot]
  Peter: Quagmire, you rat bastard! Come near my fence again, and that'll
  be your head!
  Quagmire: Hey, shut up!
  Sandy Balfour: Honey, would you like some pancakes?
  Stewie: Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!
  Lois: Stewie!
  Meg: Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new...
  Lois: Oh, Meg, a woman from Child Services came and took Stewie! She
  said we fed him dog food!
  Meg: Dog food, huh?
  Lois: Meg, is that a real Prada bag? How in the world did you make
  $1,100 as a waitress in one week?
  Meg: It's easy...when you're the unwed teenage mother of a
  crack-addicted baby. [laughing nervously]
  Peter: Wait a minute. Meg, when did you become a teenager?
  Lois: She's 16, Peter.
  Peter: You knew about this?
  Sarah: Welcome to your new foster home. Baby Stewie, say hello to your
  new brothers and sisters.
  Hispanic baby: Hola, Stewie.
  Chinese baby: Ni hao, Stewie.
  African baby: [click click] Stewie.
  Stewie: Good God! I've been adopted by a Benetton ad!
  Mrs. Stevens: I promise, it'll never happen again.
  Clerk: I hope not, Mrs. Stevens. Because next time we won't just take
  him away, we'll kill him. Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!
  Chris: So this is where babies come from?
  Brian: Yes, Chris. This is where babies come from.
  Chris: You told me I came out of your vagina!
  Clerk: Next!
  Peter: Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins.
  Clerk: Griffin, Griffin...I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork.
  Lois: Well look harder! I want my baby back!
  Peter: Lois, Lois, please, let me handle this. The name's Griffin.
  We're the ones who fed dog food to our crack-addicted baby. Jeez, I
  never was any good at dealing with the authorities.
  [Peter driving car, being pulled over by cop]
  Peter: Don't worry, Brian. I know how to handle this.
  Cop: Sir, are you aware you were going 50 in.... I'm gonna have to ask
  you to put your shirt down, sir.
  Peter: Ah, crap. I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island.
  Stewie: [screams angrily] Damn it! I want pancakes! You people
  understand every language except English! Yo quiero pancakes!
  Donnez-moi pancakes! Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!
  Sarah: Poor little guy. "Pancakes" must be street for "crack." Damn
  those parents of his.
  Jack: Sarah, forgiveness. Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the
  others?
  Chinese baby: Stewie, come complete our rainbow!
  Stewie: I've got a better idea. Let's go play "swallow the stuff under
  the sink."
  Lois: You lied to them!
  Peter: You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on
  our taxes and worship some guy named Stan.
  Bonnie: Um, actually, I said Satan. That's a typo.
  Quagmire: We didn't know who that woman was! It's not our fault!
  Lois: No? Then whose fault is it?
  Brian: It's all of yours! You were all working together just fine, but
  then you won that stupid trophy. You put some shiny hunk of metal
  before your own friendships.
  Lois: Brian's right. We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost
  sight of what was really going on. Well, now we have a real problem to
  deal with.
  Peter: That's right! Somebody tipped off the cable company about our
  free Cinemax. Joe? ...And we have to get Stewie back! I remembered.
  Cleveland: Well, we're here to help. And we must get our baby back.
  Joe: Right on! Let's do it! Rock their world! Rock their world!
  ALL: Yeah! Come on! Let's go! We can do it!
  Sarah: See kids? One day the world is going to be just like our home.
  All races living together in harmony and love.
  [Creaking]
  Stewie: Pancakes!
  Sarah: He must still be working the junk out of his system. He needs
  hugs!
  [Doorbell ringing]
  Stewie: Doorbell! Doorbell!
  Cleveland: Hi. We're from the One World, One People Book-of-the-Month
  Club. Is there something missing in yourlife?
  Jack: You know, I just bet there is. Sarah, we have guests! And one of
  them is a homosexual!
  Bonnie: They're in place! God, it gets me hot when Joe lies to
  strangers. When I get him home, I swear to God I'm gonna grease up...
  Lois: That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris.
  Chris: Here we go, Dad!
  Indian baby: Stewie, would you like to learn how to wrap a turban?
  Stewie: Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl? Or perhaps she can
  learn after her people invade your country.
  Indian baby: Yee, would your people really do this?
  Stewie: Oh, try and stop them. And try and stop Pablo's people from
  using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who will in turn
  sell them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse the rest of
  this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a
  family. So now you all understand, yes? You all hate each other?
  All: [Crying]
  Stewie: Oh, hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils.
  Peter: Oh, hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus. Just practicing for Christmas.
  Indian baby: But you're white. Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian.
  African baby: Don't be stupid! Santa is black!
  Indian baby: Santa can't be black. We do not fear him.
  Chinese baby: Cram it, Gandhi! Santa is Asian.
  Hispanic baby: How can he be Asian? Santa doesn't drive his sled 20
  miles under the speed limit with his blinker on! Go back to your rice
  paddy, Mulan!
  [Yelling]
  Peter: Come on, Stewie. We're out of here.
  Stewie: Dance, puppets! Dance!
  Peter: Lois, we got him. It's all over.
  Lois: Careful, Peter. Joe and Cleveland can't stall them anymore.
  They're heading your way!
  Peter: Oh, crap!
  Jack: Hold it right there!
  Peter: Or what?
  Stewie: Don't shoot! Now shoot!
  Lois: So, we're terribly sorry we broke into your home. But we just had
  to get Stewie back somehow.
  Sarah: Well, that's a very long story. But we've grown attached to
  little Stewie. Plus, the law's on our side.
  Peter: Oh, you people can kiss the fattest part of my ass! We'll be
  back, Stewie.
  Sarah: Wait!
  Jack: Is that a real Prada bag?
  Peter: I'd like to propose a toast: to our neighbors! Sure they may be
  black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound, but hey-if they moved
  out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in.
  Joe: Hear, hear!
  Cleveland: Hey, where's Quagmire?
  Lois: Yes, if it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where
  Stewie's foster family lived.
  Peter: He said he'd distract that social worker.
  Sandy Balfour: Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do
  for a living?
  Quagmire: Hey, I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here?
  Joe: What the heck happened to that trophy anyway?
  Brian: I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved.
  All: [Chattering]
  Brian: [moaning]
  Rod Serling: Submitted for your approval. A family pet with the
  uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard. A shameful
  secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire
  neighbor...
  Lois: Stewie seems a little feverish after his ordeal. And he keeps
  asking for pancakes. Let's just let him rest.
  Stewie: Oh! Flappy, what have you done to me? It's so hot. Now I'm
  freezing! Oh, what I wouldn't do for one syrup-soaked bite. [Screams]



Title: Death is a Bitch

Theme Song
  [Crickets chirping]
  Morley Safer: I'm Morley Safer.
  Mike Wallace: I'm Mike Wallace.
  Ed Bradley: I'm Ed Bradley.
  Lesley Stahl: I'm Lesley Stahl. And one of you is hung like an elf.
  Lois: [Laughing] I feel so naughty.
  Peter: Lois, what are you doing? Neither of us is drunk.
  Lois: [Giggling]
  Peter: Knock it off!
  Lois: Oh, my God! I found a lump! A breast lump!
  Peter: [screaming]
  Lois: The important thing is to stay calm. It's probably nothing, honey.
  Peter: That's easy for you to say. You get to keep both your cans.
  Lois: Peter, don't talk like that! You'll see a doctor tomorrow and...
  Peter: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois. The healthiest
  thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist. Just
  like we do with the squid.
  Lois: Earthquake.
  Peter: Truck going by.
  [front walk]
  Peter: I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. Nothing to worry about.
  [black cat hisses]
  [black vulture screeches]
  Black man: Morning.
  Peter: Ah!
  [at health care center]
  Peter: Give it to me straight, Doc. How long do I have?
  Dr. Hartman: Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have about a month to live. But
  hey, what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever
  had. Look at the size of this file. This is...wow. Let's just wait for
  the test results.
  Lois: Finish up, honey. Then I'll put you down for a nice nap.
  Stewie: No. No! I shall put you down for a nap, Mother! Blast!
  Lois: I'm so worried about your father.
  Chris: You mean because he's a borderline alcoholic?
  Lois: No. Mommy's made peace with that.
  Chris: Oh. 'Cause he's got a lump on his boobie.
  Lois: Chris, that's a terrible word, "boobie."
  Meg: Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned
  out okay.
  Lois: Really? Who's Debbie Miller?
  Meg: A girl I just made up.
  Peter: Oh, look. There they are-my family. You know, guys, I don't say
  this often enough, but, uh, I'm gonna die.
  Lois: Oh, my God.
  Stewie: High five! Anyone? Anyone?
  Chris: You can't die! Who's gonna take me to the Father-Son dance?
  Peter: Listen, I've had a good life. And you can always be proud of
  your father and all of his accomplishments.
  Meg: What accomplishments?
  Peter: Go to your room.
  Lois: Peter, there's no way you could die. You're the most important
  character in this family.
  [Somber music playing]
  Peter: I'll take this one. But I won't pay a cent over $60.
  Salesman: Sir, that casket costs $1,000.
  Peter: Okay, $70.
  Salesman: What?
  Peter: $2,000.
  Salesman: That's twice what it costs!
  Peter: $40.
  Salesman: What?
  Brian: He doesn't know how to haggle.
  Lois: Peter, what's going on?
  Peter: I'm selling all my worldly goods, so you'll have some cash when
  I'm dead. Yeah, a lot of memories here. Look, my first bike. Boy, I had
  so much fun playing with that.
  [child Peter]
  Peter: More tea, Mr. Bike?
  Lois: Peter, this is ridiculous. You're going to be fine.
  Meg: Dad, the doctor called. Your test results are in.
  Dr. Hartman: This doesn't look very good. No, this doesn't look very
  good at all. My nephew drew my portrait. It doesn't look a thing like
  me. Look at the nose. It's all, all...
  Lois: Will you just tell us about Peter's tests?
  Dr. Hartman: Okay, okay!. Mr. Griffin, all your tests came back
  negative. As it turns out, the lump on your chest was just a fatty
  corpuscle.
  Peter: Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian
  from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom?
  Dr. Hartman: Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine.
  Peter: I'm fine? What, are you coming on to me now?
  Lois: Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that
  you're healthy.
  Dr. Hartman: Can't it be both?
  Lois: [Kissing] My sweetie is okay.
  Peter: Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all
  the little things in life, like you and the
  kids. Is this the price of my bill or my phone number?
  Clerk: Your phone number.
  Peter: Oh. [Sheepish laughter] Well, it's still pretty pricey!
  Lois: Peter, who cares how much the bill is? You've just got the most
  important bill of all, a clean bill of health.
  Peter: Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting to crack out that gem? Aw,
  this sucks, Brian. Why should I have to pay this? There's nothing wrong
  with me.
  Brian: Yeah, it's a shame you're not dying.
  Peter: Wait a second. That's it! They can't make a dead guy pay his
  bill. All I gotta do is write "deceased" right here where it says
  "name." And where it says "sex," I'll write, "No, thanks. I'm dead."
  It's bulletproof.
  [Crickets chirping]
  Stewie: But you promised the fat one would perish.
  Lois: I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well
  and we can be a family for a good long... [Knocking]
  Peter: Who are you?
  Death: I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm
  Death. Which one of you is Peter Griffin?
  Peter: Uh, he is.
  Death: Come on, man. Which one of you is Peter Griffn?
  Peter: This is Peter Griffin.
  Death: [Laughing] Hey, that's a good one. [Continues laughing]
  Lois: Why are you...
  Death: No, wait. I'm not finished holding my sides. [Continues laughing]
  Lois: Why are...
  Death: [Continues laughing]
  Lois: Why...
  Death: [Continues laughing]
  Lois: Why are you here? The doctor said Peter was okay.
  Death: Oh, the doctor! Well, I guess he must know, right? I mean, he's
  a doctor and everything, and I'm just Death!
  Stewie: Excuse me. Hello! I'm Stewie. Big fan.
  Peter: Look, Death, you made a mistake. I'm not really supposed to be
  dead.
  Death: I made a mistake, huh? Then what do you call this?
  Lois: Peter, is that your handwriting?
  Peter: [Nervous laughter] How did you get that?
  Death: It was emailed to me by your HMO.
  Peter: Look, I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to
  call him names.
  Lois: I don't care what that says! You can't take my husband!
  Stewie: Mother! Where are your manners? Don't argue with our guest!
  Won't you join us for dinner, Death?
  Death: Oh, no. I don't want to impose. Hey, is that turkey?
  Lois: Yes, Death. We were in the middle of a turkey dinner-to celebrate
  Peter's good health.
  Death: Oh, do you mind?
  Stewie: Mind? Of course she wouldn't mind. It would be an honor. No,
  no, no, no, it would be a privilege. I-oh, dear. Listen to me prattling
  on like a schoolgirl. Come, come. You, heat up some gravy for our
  guest! My last helping of white meat was drier than Oscar Wilde.
  Meg: Ew. How did you do that?
  Death: Oh. Well, let's just say, when I was younger I did some films
  I'm not...particularly proud of. Well, that does it for me. Let's go,
  Peter.
  Lois: Wait! You can't go. After dinner, we usually go into the living
  room and live for another 40 or 50 years.
  Death: 40 or ...[Laughing] Let's go.
  Peter: I guess this is good-bye. Meg, you're the man of the family now.
  Be strong.
  Meg: Oh, Daddy.
  Peter: Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here to see you become a man.
  Stewie: Yes. I think we all know what that's going to be like.
  [flash to middle-aged Stewie]
  Stewie: A 20-minute call to Larchmont!? Who do we know in Larchmont?
  Stewie's Wife: My sister-in-law.
  Stewie: Oh, yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes. That's right. How is Carol?
  Peter: Brian.
  Brian: Oh, God.
  Chris: Daddy, can I come with you?
  Peter: Ask your mother.
  Lois: No, you can't go with him! Oh, Peter.
  Peter: Lois.
  All: [Crying]
  Death: Okay, okay, that's good. Come on now.
  Peter: Hey, Death, you got a file on me?
  Death: Yeah, somewhere, it's in the car, I think.
  Peter: Does it mention that I ran two weeks of Junior Varsity track?
  Death: Oh, let's not do this. Hey, look, I caught Flo Jo. You don't
  think I can catch you? [Screaming] My ankle! Yeah, listen, don't help
  or anything. I'm totally fine. Damn Irish.
  [back in house]
  Death: Yeah. That felt good, dropping me hard on the couch like that.
  Lois: Here's a couple of Tylenol.
  Death: Oh, great, Tylenol. Yeah, I asked for Advil. But, you know,
  Tylenol, whatever. That's good.
  Meg: I got a B-plus in Health. Is there anything I can do?
  Death: Yeah! Why don't you boil some water and rip up some sheets
  there, Einstein. It's a sprained ankle. I just have to stay off it for
  a few days.
  Peter: W-w-wait. You can't stay here.
  Death: Why not?
  Peter: You're trying to kill me! Besides, how are we supposed to
  explain you to Mr. Roper?
  Lois: Oh, it's okay, Death. You just worry about feeling better.
  Peter: Lois, what the hell are you doing?
  Lois: Peter, don't you see? As long as he's here, you can't die.
  Peter: Go on.
  Lois: That's it.
  Peter: Wait a minute. So no matter what I do, I won't die? Hey, uh,
  make yourself at home, Death. I'm going out for a while.
  Death: Hey, way, wait. You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity
  discovers I'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be
  dire.
  Peter: Go on.
  Death: That's it. What the hell do you see in him?
  Lois: Peter, where are you going?
  Peter: Lois, 10 minutes ago, I was staring Death in the face. But now
  that I've been given another chance I'm gonna do the one thing I've
  always dreamed of doing.
  [Peter on top of building]
  Peter: I'm gonna jump off this building.
  Cleveland: Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had
  something crazy in my ear.
  Quagmire: Hold the phone. You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl
  and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this?
  Peter: $1,000 says I live.
  Quagmire: 1,000 clams, huh?
  Cleveland: What the hell?
  Quagmire: Okay.
  Peter: Look at that. I beat my loogie.
  Quagmire & Cleveland: [Grumbling]
  Lois: It's your turn, Death.
  Death: You know, I know I should find this ironic, but really, I'm just
  bored as hell. Hey, how old is this TV? You can probably getthe DuMont
  Network on this thing.
  Lois: You know, Peter is a good man and a wonderful father.
  Death: Here it comes.
  Lois: Could you please find it in your heart to spare him? After all,
  it isn't really his time.
  Death: What did you make this cocoa out of, crap?
  Lois: If you want me to make it again, I...
  Death: Sorry, Lois, it's my fault. I just assumed you were gonna make
  it with milk, not crap!
  Lois: I'll be right back.
  Meg: I brought you something to read.
  Death: Glamour, great. I can learn how to please my man. Go get me an
  Entertainment Weekly. I hear it's got a great picture of me sneaking up
  on Tom Snyder.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Lois: [Screaming]
  [Saw buzzing]
  Stewie: Victory is mine!
  Lois: Wow. I should really watch where I'm going.
  Stewie: What the deuce? Of course! It seems with Death incapacitated,
  my matricidal efforts are futile. I must do all I can to accelerate his
  convalescence. "Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone"
  Cleveland: I can't believe you drank 300 bottles of beer without
  succumbing to alcohol poisoning. Peter, are you a witch?
  Peter: Yeah. But don't tell anyone. The consequences could be dire!
  Hey, you guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking
  bikers and say: "Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons?"
  Quagmire: Peter, no!
  Cleveland: Peter, now you're just being brainless.
  Peter: Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons?
  Biker 1: Hey!
  Peter: Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend, Richard Simmons?
  Biker 2: Shut up!
  Peter: [Laughing]
  [gunfire]
  Cleveland: Hey.
  [Everyone laughing]
  Death: Ah, that feels good. You know, actually, kid, I kind of fell
  into this gig. You know, I really wanted to be a wood nymph. But, man,
  the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: "I have no son.
  I have no son," and Mom...Mom just stood there.
  Stewie: Yes. Mothers can be quite the botheration, can't they? That's
  why we've got to get you well.
  Death: What was that?
  Stewie: Nothing!
  Lois: Stewie, leave Death alone.
  Death: He's okay. You know, he reminds me a lot of me at that age. I
  hope his teen years go better than mine. Boy, talk about awkward.
  [car rocking on beach]
  Girl: Oh. Oh, yes.
  Death: Oh, Sandy! Sandy! Sandy? Oh, not again. I'm gonna be a virgin
  forever. Or am I?
  Lois: Can we please talk about Peter? He has so much to live for,
  Death. He loves his children and me...
  Death: Okay, okay. I'll spare his life. But you owe me, if you get my
  drift. What the hell are you doing? I was talking about another fruit
  cup. Not bad, though.
  Lois: Peter, Death just agreed to let you live.
  Peter: Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV.
  Tom Tucker: Our top story tonight, the rules of Death no longer apply.
  Diane Simmons: That's right, Tom. Our own Asian reporter, Tricia
  Takanawa, filed this report, all by herself!
  Tricia Takanawa: I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he
  withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die. Peter, are you saying
  that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be
  completely unharmed?
  Peter: Why don't you give it a shot?
  Tricia Takanawa: Okay, here goes.
  Peter: [Screaming]
  Tricia Takanawa: What have I done?
  Peter: [Laughing]
  Tricia Takanawa: Oh, you're awful.
  Diane Simmons: Fascinating story, Tom.
  Tom Tucker: It sure is, Diane. And since the laws of Death no longer
  apply, I can do this.
  Diane Simmons: That's right, Tom.
  Tom Tucker: Ha-ha! And now it's time for sports.
  Death: Great. The whole world is laughing at me. This is high school
  all over again. Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them! Oh, my
  God, that hurts!
  Lois: Oh, no. You're not killing anyone tonight, mister! Not on that
  ankle.
  Death: This is all your fault. And there's only one solution. You have
  to go out there and do my job. You have to be Death!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Peter: Boy, this doesn't leave much to the imagination, does it?h
  Lois: Death, there is no way Peter can do your job. He could never kill
  anyone.
  Peter: Yeah! I mean, you know, I've thought about it, like in church
  and stuff, but I don't think I could ever do what you do.
  Death: Why, you think you're better than me? I'm tired of always being
  the bad guy. What I do has to be done.
  Brian: He's right, Peter. You've disturbed the natural order of things.
  People need to be able to die.
  [Sentimental instrumental music a la "Titanic"]
  Kate Winslet: No!
  Leonardo DiCaprio: You know, actually, I think I'm gonna be okay.
  Kate Winslet: Oh, Jack. Now we can get married and everything you
  promised.
  Leonardo DiCaprio: Yeah, about that. Uh, I was pretty sure I was gonna
  die...'cause actually, there's this girl in New York, and it's getting
  kind of serious. But, you know,thanks for letting me draw you naked. I
  still can't believe you let me do that!
  Peter: So what, you're saying the only way to make the world right is
  for me to kill someone?
  Stewie: I know! Why don't you kill Lois?
  Death: No. One death isn't gonna do it. You have to do something that
  will get everyone's attention, something huge.
  Chris: How about if you blow up the Earth?
  Death: Too huge. But you're thinking. I like that.
  Meg: You could kill all the girls who are prettier than me.
  Death: Well, that would just leave England. Wait. Wait, I have it. I'm
  a genius. You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek!
  Peter: I knew it! I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I
  said: "I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids."
  Lois: It's true. He did say it.
  Death: A bunch of hot, young celebrities. It's perfect! The kids are on
  their way to LA to renegotiate their contracts. But...but their plane
  is gonna be making a little stopover in Rhode Island. If you go right
  now, you can catch the flight.
  Peter: Forget it, Death. I'm not going to do your dirty work. There's
  no way I'm getting on that plane. Absolutely no way, and that's final.
  See? I'm still here. And there's nothing you can say that'll change my
  mind.
  Death: Either you kill them, or I kill you.
  [Peter on plane]
  Peter: Aw, crap! Nice plant. Note to self, do not go to the bathroom.
  Man: Look, James, your last movie killed at the box office. Your
  Q-rating's through the roof. It's time we ditched the WB and
  concentrate on features.
  James Van Der Beek: Sir, I don't know who you are, but just because
  you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career
  advice.
  Man: Oh. Will you sign my ass?
  James Van Der Beek: You have a pen?
  Peter: Hello, Death? Guess where I'm calling from? A plane!
  Death: That's great. Listen, those kids on board?
  Peter: Yeah. About that, I don't think I can go through with it.
  Death: Peter, listen, without death, the world would be a terrible
  place. Imagine a world where Hitler was still alive.
  Announcer: Today on "Hitler!", we'll be talking with Hollywood hunk,
  Christian Slater.
  Hitler: Now, they tell me in your next movie, we get to see your butt.
  [Girls cheering]
  Christian Slater: Yes, yes, you do.
  Hitler: Can we see it right now?
  Christian Slater: Well, all right, Hitler.
  Hitler: Oh! He's going to do it!
  Announcer: If you're going to be in the Los Angeles area, und would
  like tickets to Hitler call 213-du werdest eine Krankenschwester
  brauchen!
  Death: Look, Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna
  crash in LA. Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies.
  Peter: Jeez, everybody?
  Death: Except you. Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda?
  Peter: Still me.
  Death: Brenda?
  Peter: "Yes?" Just kidding, it's still me.
  Pilot: We now begin our final approach into Los Angeles International.
  If you look out the window to you're right, you'll see the San Fernando
  Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn.
  We'll be on the
  ground in 10 minutes.
  Peter: Aw, jeez.
  Girl Scouts: ? We like being alive, we like being alive? ?We like
  being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive ?
  Peter: I guess it's their time.
  [the theme from Dawson's Creek ("I Don't Want To Wait" by Paula Cole)
  playing]
  Pacey: Boy, for a teacher, you sure make love good.
  Teacher: Actually, it's "well," Pacey. You mean to say, I make love
  "well." You're good to go again, right?
  Pacey: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
  Death: Peter? Hello, Peter? Peter, are you there? I can hear you
  breathing!
  Peter: Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it. I've changed my mind. I
  don't care if you do kill me, I'm not gonna kill those kids. If they
  die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays...other than the fine
  programs on Fox. Hey, open up in there!
  Pilot: Hey, what are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot
  in the world!
  Peter: I'm here to keep you from making an error. A pilot error. Jeez,
  I probably should've worn mittens!
  James Van Der Beek: Nice going, fat...
  Peter: Hey, I was just trying to save your lives. But now you're all
  gonna die. No one can land this plane.
  Karen Black: I can.
  Peter: Thank God! It's Karen Black! She landed a busted plane in
  "Airport '75"? It was a movie, in the '70s. Ah, you damn kids with your
  music.
  Tom Tucker: Both of the pilots were killed. Fortunately for the other
  passengers, actress Karen Black, star of such films as "Nashville" and
  "Five Easy Pieces," was on board.
  Diane Simmons: Our hats are off to Miss Black for proving once again,
  that, given the opportunity, actresses over 50 can land large aircraft.
  Tom Tucker: Karen Black. What an obscure reference.
  Death: Hey, what the hell? I told you to waste those kids from
  "Dawson's Creek."
  Lois: You're missing the important thing here. You said you wanted
  everyone to know the rules of death apply. And now the whole world does.
  Death: Yeah, I guess so. You know, my ankle's starting to feel better.
  I should probably get out of your hair.
  Stewie: Oh, but you just got here! Oh, we can stay in touch, can't we?
  Oh, oh, oh, what's your e-mail? Mine is "LoisMustDie," all one word,
  @yahoo.com."
  Peter: Wait a second. Death? I used to fear you, but now I'm glad we
  met. Because you've given me a great gift-the complete Boz Scaggs. How
  did you know?
  Death: I just had a feeling.
  Lois: We're gonna miss you, Death.
  Death: Hey, don't worry. I'll be back...really, really soon. [Laughing]
  "Is he joking?" Okay, see you later.

Title: The King is Dead

Theme Song
  Tom Tucker: It was a moving scene today at Hatch Pond as six members of
  the Pawtucket fire department struggled valiantly to save the life of a
  fish, trapped under the frozen ice. Rescue workers managed to get the
  fish out of the water, but unfortunately it died shortly after. Diane?
  Diane Simmons: Well, Tom, another life was tragically cut short today.
  Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog
  Players, passed away this afternoon.
  Lois: Oh, my God!
  [Phone ringing]
  Diane Simmons: Kimble was a hands-on director who often appeared in his
  own shows, most recently, Miss Saigon.
  Robert Kimble: ?La la la la la, Miss Saigon ? ? La la la la la, Miss
  Saigon?
  Lois: Yes, I just heard. It's so sad. Really? They want me to be the
  new artistic director of the Quahog Players!
  Chris: All right, Mom!
  Meg: Are you gonna do it?
  Lois: I don't know. It's such a big responsibility. I need a moment to
  think. [pause] Okay, I'll do it.
  Tom Tucker: This just in: Lois Griffin is named the new artistic
  director of the Quahog Players.
  Lois: All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that
  old hack have finally paid off.
  Brian: Oh, Lois, congratulations! Our little theater group finally has
  a committed visionary at its helm. And such an attractive one.
  Lois: Brian, you'll have to audition just like everyone else.
  Brian: Oh, God, of course. I...you didn't think...you thought I
  was...Lois!
  Chris: I can paint scenery.
  Meg: Can I be in the show, Mom?
  Stewie: Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and
  cries because nobody finds her attractive. [vicious laughing]
  Peter: Hey, you guys.
  Lois: Peter, guess what? I am gonna...
  Peter: Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for
  the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus.
  Chris: Hey, Dad, why don't you invent the Frisbee? That's an awesome
  toy.
  Meg: It's already been invented.
  Chris: Then how come I never heard of it?
  Peter: This is my chance to prove how valuable I am to the company!
  Sorry, Lois. What's your news?
  Lois: Well, I-
  Peter: Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board, may I present this
  year's hottest toy...Mr. Zucchini Head. He's got stupid cool hip-hop
  style with his little hat and his Doc Martens.
  Mr. Weed: Thank you, Peter, that's enough.
  Peter: Wait, wait, wait. This is the best part! He dances!
  Man 1: I've seen enough.
  Man 2: Inappropriate.
  Man 3: I haven't had sex in four years.
  Mr. Weed: Gentlemen, I apologize for wasting your time. Peter is an
  adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company
  does not pay him to think. [Laughing]
  Peter: [Nervous laughter]
  Mr. Weed: I'll take this. No calls.
  Lois: Come on, kids! The director can't be late for the auditions.
  Peter: You should've heard them laughing at me, Lois. I got great
  ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser. Except that
  guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine.
  Lois: Peter, a lot of creative people had mindless jobs. Michelangelo
  worked in a marble quarry. Herman Melville was a customs agent. Albert
  Einstein worked for the patent office.
  Albert Einstein: And what is it you want to patent, Herr Smith?
  Smith: I call it "Smith's Theory of Relativity."
  Albert Einstein: Hey, look at this.
  Smith: What?
  Brian: I think what Lois is tying to say is you have to find a way to
  express yourself creatively. For example, Chris has his drawing, Meg
  does her birdcalls, I sing-beautifully.
  Lois: So I've heard.
  Brian: And Lois has her theater group.
  Lois: Yes. And for my first production, I've chosen The King and I.
  It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces
  culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal...Peter, please don't
  wipe your nose on the couch. Look, I have to go. Part of being creative
  is figuring out what you're good at. I know you can do it if you put
  your mind to it.
  Peter: You're right, Lois. Man was meant to create. That's why God
  invented Shrinky Dinks.
  God: It works! Look how tiny they are! Oof!
  [Sweeping instrumental music]
  Brian: ?Oh, no not in springtime ? ? summer, winter, or fall ? ? No,
  never would I leave you ? ?at all ?
  Joe: Bravo!
  Lois: Brian, that was beautiful! Thank you!
  Brian: No, no, no, thank you. And that note you gave me, "louder," I
  was thinking that, and then you said it-
  Lois: -okay-
  Brian: -you're so intuitive. It's a pleasure...
  Lois: Okay. All right. Next! Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's
  play?
  Stewie: "Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by
  this sun of York. And all..."
  Lois: Why don't you sing "Itsy Bitsy Spider"?
  Stewie: How dare you reduce my finely hewn thespian stylings to mere
  Mother Gooseries!
  Lois: Oh, sing "Baa Baa Black Sheep"!
  Stewie: You know, Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen
  Hayes, once said: "I'm going to kill you!"
  Peter: Hey, can somebody give me a hand with all this talent?
  Lois: Peter, what are you doing here?
  Peter: Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity, like you said. First
  I took an art class.
  [Peter in art class, with male nude model]
  Peter: Am I supposed to draw the penis?
  [back with Lois]
  Peter: Then I tried sculpting.
  [Peter in sculpture class, with male nude model]
  Peter: Am I supposed to sculpt the penis?
  [back with Lois]
  Peter: Then I tried music.
  [Peter conducting musicians]
  Peter: Am I supposed to conduct with my penis?
  [back with Lois]
  Peter: I was starting to think there was nothing I'd be good at. But
  then I realized that this is it. Lois, my penis belongs on stage.
  Lois: Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition. You know, sing, dance.
  Peter: [Laughs] I get it.
  [Peter gets on stage]
  Peter: Hello, everybody. This is just a formality, since I happen to be
  doing the director. [Laughs] Five, six, seven, eight.
  Peter: [out of tune] ?Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine
  expedition ? ? Met the greatest earthquake ever known ? ? High on the
  rapids, it struck their tiny raft ? [Yells] ? And plunged them down a
  thousand feet below ? ? to the Land of the Lost? [Growls]
  Lois: Before I post the cast list, my choreographer and I want to thank
  everyone for auditioning.
  Joe: You were all great.
  Lois: Weren't they? I only wish the show was called "The King and Us"
  so I could cast you all.
  Brian: [kiss-up laughing]
  Loretta: Anna! Oh, baby, baby! I'm a star!
  Cleveland: Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before. Except for Pearl
  Bailey at a book signing once, but then we later found out it wasn't
  actually her.
  Stewie: Siamese baby? Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts!
  Lois: Oh, you wanted a bigger part, didn't you, sweetie?
  Stewie: Oh, to hell with you! Perhaps I'll skip the stage and go
  directly to films!
  [Title card: "There's Something About Stewie"]
  Ben Stiller: Hello.
  Stewie: What is that on your ear? Is that-is that hair gel?
  Ben Stiller: Yeah.
  Stewie: Great, 'cause I could use some.
  Ben Stiller: No, don't!
  Stewie: I just ran out.
  Ben Stiller: [Sighing]
  Quagmire: Aw, man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp!
  Brian: The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead! This is so
  unexpected!
  Quagmire: Hey, shut up!
  Brian: The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead!
  Peter: Lois, I think you made a mistake. I'm not "The King." I'm not
  "I," I'm not anybody. So, what? I had sex with you for nothing?
  Lois: No, Peter, I.... It's just that directing this show is a big
  opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it.
  Peter: Ruin it?
  Lois: Yes. By not using you to your full potential. You have too much
  talent for the stage. You should...[stuttering]...you should be a
  producer.
  Peter: A producer? Gee, I don't know.
  [Peter in robe poolside]
  Peter: Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr. We made the deal. We're richer
  and more powerful than ever! I'm the king of the wor-[screams]-damn it!
  [Mexican dinner music playing]
  Mexican man: [Spanish] Who is this?
  Mexican woman: [Spanish] He's the answer to my prayers!
  Mexican man: [Spanish] Why?
  [back at theater]
  Peter: I love Mexicans. I'll do it!
  [Piano playing "King and I" music]
  Joe: Hang on, hang on, hang on! You overextended the plié!
  You screwed it all up. Let me show you again. Okay, boys! Let's do it!
  And one, two, three. And one, two, three. And just like this. And watch
  my feet. And one, two, three.
  Lois: Peter, Chris says you told him to build a set for the North Pole.
  Peter: Yeah, that's where Anna goes to talk with her best friend, a
  penguin.
  Lois: There is no talking penguin in The King and I.
  Peter: There is in "Peter Griffin presents The King and I."
  Lois: What?
  Peter: Now we just gotta think of some wicked funny stuff for him to
  say.
  Lois: Peter, the director decides whether or not to add a character.
  You're the producer, remember?
  Peter: What am I supposed to do with all my great ideas? Put 'em in a
  tub and clean myself with them? 'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois.
  Lois: Good producers put their ideas to work outside the theater. It's
  your job to make sure we sell every seat in this house.
  Peter: And that's creative?
  Lois: Is it? Well, it's just the most creative job there is.
  Peter: Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out. I'll tell two
  friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right
  there.
  Tom Tucker: [to self in mirror] Hey, I recognize you from the
  television. You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this.
  Peter: Excuse me?
  Tom Tucker: You. Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on, get out of
  here!
  Peter: Oh, wow! Diane Simmons!
  Diane Simmons: You don't look anything like the ad. You better be huge.
  Peter: No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer. I'm presenting "Peter Griffin
  presents "The King and I" a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving
  you the exclusive story.
  Diane Simmons: Look, pal, some two-bit community theater production
  isn't news. Who's the star? For that matter, who the hell are you, and
  why should I give a damn?
  Peter: Wow, I'm being interviewed by Diane Simmons!
  Peter: Well, Lois, you told me to produce, and I did. I got us a story
  on the 11:00 news.
  Brian: Really?
  Lois: Oh, Peter!
  Diane Simmons: Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of
  Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I. Tom?
  Tom Tucker: Thanks, Diane. In other news, I won't be going to the play
  because I'm sure it will be lousy.
  Diane Simmons: Tom, I'm getting late word that you're a petty, jealous,
  closet case.
  Tom Tucker: Bit of breaking news. We now go live to Diane being a
  bitch. Diane?
  Lois: But Loretta's playing Anna, and she's doing a great job.
  Peter: Loretta's a nobody. Diane Simmons is a star. Look, Lois, you
  wanted me to sell tickets, right? Well, people who've never even been
  in a theater will come see a show with Diane Simmons.
  Lois: I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter.
  Peter: Hey, hey, some of our greatest actors started in news, like Sean
  Penn.
  Sean Penn: Today's weather calls for breezy skies and sun, and there's
  gonna be a...get that [bleep]ing camera out of my face!
  Peter: Hey, everybody, here's our star!
  Diane Simmons: Oh, this is so awkward. You all know my name, and I've
  never heard of any of you.
  Loretta: You ever acted before, honey?
  Diane Simmons: Well, I did an independent film in college.
  [Melancholic instrumental music]
  Lois: Let's start with the scene where Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort
  the king.
  Diane Simmons: Oh, are you playing Lady Thiang?
  Loretta: Mmm-hmm. I was supposed to be Anna.
  Diane Simmons: Oh. Well, they did an all-you-people version of Hello,
  Dolly that was very successful.
  Lois: Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7. Action!
  Loretta: "Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him."
  Diane Simmons: "Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go
  to him."
  Peter: Cut! All wrong! No good!
  Lois: Peter, what are you doing? She was wonderful.
  Loretta: My ass.
  Lois: Besides, I'm the director.
  Peter: It just doesn't feel real, you know? Anna and Miss Thing both
  love the king, right? On Springer yesterday, they had "I won't share my
  husband" and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went
  nuts. Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane?
  Loretta: I think I can do that.
  Lois: Wait a minute. Nobody's slapping anybody. This is Rodgers and
  Hammerstein, not trash TV!
  Diane Simmons: I think Peter may be onto something. Springer is one of
  our station's highest-rated shows.
  Lois: I don't know.
  Peter: I thought you wanted to do a good show? If you want to do a bad
  show, why don't we just do Rent?
  Lois: I guess we can try that...
  Loretta: Action!
  Peter: Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts make Diane look a little hippy,
  you know? I was thinking we could dress her in a pair of sequined capri
  pants.
  Lois: Peter, they didn't have capri pants in the 1860s.
  Peter: They did now! Ah!
  Stewie: You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since
  Andrew Lloyd Webber! And you! Well, I just plain don't like you.
  ALL: [Laughing]
  Lois: What's going on?
  Peter: We're just having a little pow-wow to discuss my latest changes.
  Lois: What changes?
  Peter: The Siamese children. How about this? They're not children.
  They're aliens!
  Quagmire: That was great, Peter.
  Brian: Right on the money.
  Diane Simmons: Isn't he brilliant?
  Lois: No! He's not brilliant! Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant!
  And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes!
  Meg: We sold out!
  Chris: Yeah. The whole town's talking about your show, Dad!
  ALL: [Cheering]
  Lois: Your show? Peter, this is my show!
  Peter: What's the big deal? You wanted to sell out, and we did.
  Lois: I am through selling out. I took this job because I wanted to
  create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that! You
  want to be the director? Fine! I quit!
  Peter: Me, direct? I don't know what to say, except, "I'm the king of
  the wor-" Ah!
  [kitchen]
  Peter: Morning, theater fans!
  Lois: Good morning, Peter. I made your favorite breakfast.
  Peter: What the hell is this?
  Lois: French toast. I just made a few creative changes to the recipe. I
  think it's a lot better now.
  Peter: Lois, if this is your idea of a joke, you must write for Leno.
  Stewie: Oh, oh! You know, it is so fashionable to take a shot at Jay
  Leno. Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with
  fresh material and he's charming.
  Peter: Face it, Lois, you're just jealous because people like my ideas
  better than yours.
  Lois: I don't care if the whole world loves your ideas. That doesn't
  make them good. I was trying to make art.
  Peter: Oh, art-schmart. Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter
  they'll produce Shakespeare.
  Monkey 1: Uh, let's see. "A 'something' by any other name..."
  Monkey 2: "Carnation," "peony."
  Monkey 3: No, they did that on last week's Marlowe.
  Monkey 4: What about "daisy"?
  Monkey 5: "Chrysanthemum"!
  Monkey 2: "Iris," "rose"? What about "rose"?
  Monkey 1: Did you say "rose"?
  Monkey 4: Yeah, "rose." "Rose" is good!
  Monkey 1: "A rose by any other name." That works.
  Monkey 4: I like that a lot.
  Monkey 1: Moving on.
  Monkey 5: Hey, what about "tulip"?
  Monkey 1: "Rose" is fine. Moving on.
  Lois: Peter, you've never done a creative thing in your life!
  Peter: That's not true. I wrote "Bonfire of the Vanities."
  Lois: No, you didn't.
  Peter: You win this round, Lois.
  Lois: You're not being creative. You're just destroying a wonderful
  show.
  Peter: Hey, I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do
  before 9:00 a.m.
  Lois: The only thing you create before 9:00 a.m. is exactly what you've
  turned my show into.
  Peter: I think my work will speak for itself. Oh, ha-ha, I just got
  that. A poop joke? That's real creative, Lois.
  [on stage]
  Peter: Okay, let's run this scene again. Now, remember, Diane, you're
  playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the
  fight of her life.
  Diane Simmons: Where does it say that?
  Peter: In my noodle. Okay, places. And action!
  [quasi-Flashdance music playing]
  Peter: Stop! All wrong! All wrong! God, send me dancers.
  Diane Simmons: We've been rehearsing for hours. I'm exhausted!
  Peter: Well, I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I
  don't think we're ready!
  Diane Simmons: Of course we're not! You keep changing everything!
  Peter: You bet I do! Because theater is alive. It's a living, breathing
  creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her!
  Diane Simmons: I can't work this way. I quit!
  Peter: Fine.
  Joe: We can't do The King and I without Anna.
  Quagmire: Yeah. This is a real snafu.
  Peter: We don't need Diane Simmons. We've had someone better all along.
  Someone radiant and sassy, with the soul and passion that can only come
  from hundreds of years of black oppression.
  Loretta: Thank you, Peter. I'll do it.
  Peter: Get over yourself. I was talking about me.
  Brian: Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio.
  Stagehand: Two minutes, everybody. Two minutes.
  Brian: Fe-fe-fo-fo.
  Peter: Jeez, full house. Well, well, look who came crawling back.
  Joe: Peter, have you seen my wheelchair?
  Chris: I don't get it, Mom. If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your
  show, why'd you come to opening night?
  Lois: I came because I love the theater. I mean, if I just came here to
  enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of
  his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be?
  Chris: A bitch.
  Peter: [voiceover] Siam, 2015 AD. The city lies in ruins after the
  ninth nuclear World War. It is a grim future with lots of explosions
  and partial nudity. A future where an oppressive new king has seized
  power. Only one man can stop him. No-one machine.
  Peter: I am an Automaton Nuclear Neo-human Android. You may call me
  ANNA. I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy
  you and free this land from your tyranny.
  Brian: I have been expecting you, ANNA. Allow me to introduce my
  Siamese children.
  [Sultry instrumental music]
  Peter: I will not be swayed by your attempts to confuse my programming
  with your all-female sex orgy. We must kung fu fight!
  Brian: So be it, ANNA.
  [Kung fu fighting noises]
  Peter: I have slain the evil emperor. I hereby proclaim Siam the United
  States of America.
  ALL: ?ANNA rules!?
  Peter: ?'Cause I kicked all the bad guys in their jewels!?
  ALL: ?ANNA won!?
  Peter: ?Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun!?
  ALL: ?Dance and shout ? ? He's the world's greatest ninja, there's no
  doubt?
  Peter: ?Though they tried to defeat me ? ? they can all just freakin'
  eat me?
  Brian: ?Because he blew all of us away?
  ALL: ?In the planet of Siam, there's no one as tough as I am?
  Peter: ?Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay?
  [Heroic instrumental music] [Crowd cheering]
  Lois: Oh, my God! They liked it? Stop it! Stop clapping right now!
  What's wrong with you? These people shouldn't be encouraged! They
  should be punished! That man has committed murder here this evening,
  and the victim's name is "theater." This is the kind of mind-numbing
  schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland! This
  isn't art! This isn't even entertainment! This...blows!
  [Gasps]
  Peter: Uh...[Farting] [Continues farting]
  [Laughing] [Cheering]
  Lois: See? This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about.
  [Griffin bedroom]
  Lois: How was the cast party?
  Peter: We're a hit. Man, what a night. I got to see my ideas come to
  life. It's the greatest feeling in the world.
  Lois: Yeah, I bet it is.
  Peter: And it's all thanks to you. I never would've discovered I could
  be creative if you hadn't believed in me.
  Lois: Well, actually I didn't, really, not at first. But anyone who
  could take The King and I and turn it into that is...well, he's gotta
  be creative.
  Peter: Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you. But I'll do
  whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year. It'll be
  "Peter Griffin presents a Lois Griffin production." Okay, honey?
  Lois: Deal.
  Peter: [chuckling] Hey, were you there when I farted?

  [Mellow music playing on TV]
  Woman: Boy, that lotion sure feels good.
  Woman 2: Sure is hot!
  Woman: And it just got hotter! Here, now let me do you.
  Announcer: Pawtucket Patriot Beer. If you buy it, hot women will have
  sex in your backyard.
  Lois: Typical male fantasy-women drinking beer. I guarantee you a man
  made that commercial.
  Peter: Of course a man made it. It's a commercial, Lois, not a
  delicious Thanksgiving dinner.
  Chris: Dad, we won a boat! We won a boat!
  Peter: Holy crap! We did! We won a free freakin' boat!
  Meg: Dad, nobody gives things away for free.
  Peter: That's not true. I know plenty of people who give things away.
  Crowd: Free Tibet! Free Tibet!
  Peter: I'll take it! <dials phone> Hello, China? I have
  something you may want. But it's gonna cost you. That's right. All the
  tea.
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Lois: I knew there was a catch. You have to sit through one of those
  awful time-share presentations.
  Peter: Oh. that's a small price to pay. I am gonna be the first one on
  Spooner Street to have his own boat!
  Quagmire: Whoa! All hands on deck! I'm getting a boat!
  Cleveland: Hey, Quagmire. I'm also getting a boat, too.
  Joe: Right on! Whoo! I can't wait to get my sea legs! Yeah!
  Peter: Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy on Spooner Street to get
  a boat.
  Fat Albert: Hey, hey, hey! I'm getting a boat!
  Peter: Oh, man! Even Della Reese is getting a boat.
  Salesman: These wonderful homes on this beautifully secluded island can
  be yours with almost no strings attached. Beautiful island. Nothing out
  of the ordinary here. Just beautiful homes and nothing else. Each
  residence has 200 feet of pristine oceanfront. No city noise, no
  flesh-eating ogres, no pollution.
  Lois: I hate these high-pressure sales situations.
  Peter: Oh, that's so cute. You're just afraid that because you're a
  woman you're gonna do something stupid like buy that time-share, or not
  realize that your husband taped over our wedding video with softcore
  cable porn.
  Lois: You taped over our wedding video?
  Peter: Relax, Lois. I just taped over the boring stuff.
  Priest: The couple has written their own vows, which they will now
  recite to each other.
  Lois: Peter, I...
  [static]
  Woman: Look, the only reason I got myself arrested was to find out what
  happened to my sister.
  Guard: Excuse me, ladies. It's laundry time.
  [Cheesy porn music playing]
  Woman: It's so cold in here. I mean, look at my...
  Lois: Oh, my God, Peter! I sent a copy of that tape to my Great Aunt
  Lil!
  Old Woman: This wedding is hot!
  Old Man: Wake up, damn it! Wake up!
  Jim Kaplan: Hello, Mr. And Mrs....Griffin. Now, I know you've been here
  all day. So, if you'll sign this contract without reading it, I'll take
  your blank check and you won't not be not loving your time-share before
  you know it.
  Peter: Oh ho, look slick, we're not gonna buy your lousy time-share,
  all right? Now, where's my boat?
  Jim Kaplan: Hold on! You have a choice. You can have the boat or the
  mystery box.
  Lois: Are you crazy? We'll take the boat.
  Peter: Not so fast, Lois. A boat's a boat. But the mystery box could be
  anything. It could even be a boat. You know how much we wanted one of
  those.
  Lois: Then let's just...
  Peter: We'll take the box.
  [in car]
  Lois: "We'll take the box." You gave up a boat for free tickets to a
  crappy comedy club.
  Peter: Come on, Lois! You're acting like this is the first time I've
  ever done something stupid. You remember the time I was supposed to get
  that boat?
  [flashes back to office]
  Peter: A boat's a boat. But the mystery box could be anything. It could
  even be a boat. You know how much we wanted one of those.
  Lois: Then let's just...
  Peter: We'll take the box.
  [back in car]
  Lois: Peter, that just happened 10 minutes ago.
  Peter: Who cares? I'll bet nobody took the boat. Who could resist the
  call of the mystery box?
  Cleveland: Yahoo!
  Quagmire: Hey, look at me. I'm the man in the boat. All right.
  Bonnie: Joe, look to the right. It's the Griffins.
  Joe: We're nautical now, baby-that's called "starboard." But I'll
  forgive you, because you sex me up. Now, give me some sugar. Hey,
  neighbors! Where's your boat?
  Lois: We didn't take the boat. We took the mystery box. Hop in.
  Cleveland: Hey, Quagmire. Maybe the comedian will tell some jokes about
  boats or boating or owning a boat.
  Quagmire: Yeah. Or maybe he'll tell some jokes about being a sucker!
  Cleveland: Oh, Quagmire. You're what the Spaniards call el terrible.
  Brian: What are you so upset about? I never even knew you liked boats.
  Peter: Hey, hey, boating's in my blood. Ever since my
  great-grandfather, Huck Griffin, rafted down the mighty Mississippi.
  Jim: What did you just call me?
  Huck Griffin: I thought that was your name.
  Jim: That is our word! You've got no right using it!
  Huck Griffin: Hey, I'm cool, I'm cool. No problem. Could you pass me
  the oar, N-word Jim?
  Jim: Thank you.
  Peter: <drunk> This comic sucks! He couldn't make me
  laugh, even if I was laughing my ass off and he was making me do it.
  Come on, Skinny! Make me laugh!
  Lois: Peter, that's a microphone stand.
  Peter: Oh, well, pardon me for thinking a microphone stand in a comedy
  club should tell a joke or two. I guess I'm just old-fashioned that way.
  Comedian: Hi. Welcome to...
  Peter: <fake laugh> Very funny.
  Comedian: Excuse me, sir. I haven't even...
  Peter: Oh, oh, that one was hilarious! That was even funnier than your
  first joke! Hey, put skinny back up there.
  Lois: Peter!
  Comedian: You think this is easy? You want to come up here and try this?
  Peter: I thought you'd never ask.
  Brian: Uh, Peter, maybe you shouldn't do this. You've never had a lot
  of luck telling jokes.
  [Peter in net on the Planet of the Apes, with dozens of apes aiming
  guns at him]
  Peter: Okay, how many dirty, stinkin' apes does it take to screw in a
  light bulb? Three. One dirty, stinkin' ape to screw in the light bulb
  and two dirty, stinkin' apes to throw feces at each other. [Laughing]
  [back in comedy club]
  Peter: Don't worry. I got it under control. [on stage] Hey, how about
  that Viagra, huh? You know what that stuff does, huh? Huh? Come on!
  What are you people, stupid? [Peter sticks beer bottle in pocket,
  making it appear as if he is urinating on himself] You like a little
  abuse, huh? Yeah. Well, you guys are stupid and ugly. If there was a
  stupid-and-ugly contest, you'd all win! Or lose. Whichever is funnier.
  [Griffin kitchen]
  Peter: Hey. Hey, Lois. What do you call a woman who takes forever to
  cook breakfast?
  Lois: I swear to God, Peter!
  Peter: You call her "Lois." [Laughing]
  Stewie: [laughing] Well, the fat man made a funny. I rather enjoyed
  that. Yes, yes, you cook very slowly. As a matter of fact, if you were
  any slower at cooking you...well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at
  all, now, would you? That one wasn't very good.
  Lois: Peter, they were laughing at you because it looked like you peed
  yourself, not because they liked your jokes.
  Peter: Well, maybe that was part of my act. Urine happens to be very
  edgy. But I guess an unfunny person like you wouldn't understand that.
  Stewie: Okay, okay. I've got it. If you cooked any more slowly, you
  wouldn't need an egg timer, you'd need an egg calendar! [Laughing] Oh,
  that's right. I went there.
  [Happy-Go-Lucky Toy factory]
  Peter: Okay, okay, okay, wait, here's another one. Why do women have
  boobs? So you got something to look at while you're talking to them!
  Men: [Laughing] Good one, Peter. That's what they're for, all right.
  Woman: Are you telling jokes? I love jokes.
  Peter: All right. Then you'll love this one. Okay. Why do women have
  boobs? So you got something to look at while you're talking to them. So
  you got something to look at while you're talking to them. So you got-
  [Mr. Weed's office]
  Peter: You wanted to see me, Mr. Weed?
  Mr. Weed: Peter, we have a problem.
  Gloria Ironbox: Mr. Griffin, I'm Gloria Ironbox. I represent one of
  your co-workers, Sarah Bennett. She's suing you and the company for
  sexual harassment.
  Peter: Sarah, Sarah...I don't-oh, is she the one we videotaped taking a
  dump? Why? What happened?
  Gloria Ironbox: Sexual harassment is a very serious charge, Mr. Griffin.
  Peter: All right, look, first of all, if I can speak in my own defense,
  all I did was tell a little joke. Second of all, women are not people.
  They are devices built by the Lord Jesus Christ for our entertainment.
  Mr. Weed: Peter, please! Miss Ironbox, I assure you, this company in no
  way condones Peter's conduct. In fact, a film on employee relations has
  been a mandatory part of our personnel training for 50 years.
  [title card: Women in the Workplace ©1956]
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Host: Irrational and emotionally fragile by nature, female coworkers
  are a peculiar animal. They are very insecure about their appearance.
  Be sure to tell them how good they look every day, even if they're
  homely and unkempt. "You're doing a great job, Muriel, and you're
  prettier than Mamie Van Doren." And remember, nothing says "good job"
  like a firm, open-palm slap on the behind.
  Gloria Ironbox: Mr. Weed, I teach a workplace-sensitivity training
  class for the Women's Action Coalition. If Mr. Griffin completes my
  course, we'll drop the lawsuit.
  Mr. Weed: I assure you, Peter will be there. His job depends on it.
  Gloria Ironbox: Good. I'm looking forward to it.
  Peter: You know, If I wasn't so sure you were a lesbian, I'd say you
  were coming on to me.
  [Quahog community center]
  Gloria Ironbox: All right, now, let's do some role-playing. I'll be the
  office assistant. Mr. Henson, why don't you play the boss, and we'll
  see what you've learned tonight?
  Mr. Henson: Okay.
  Gloria Ironbox: The filing is done, Mr. Henson.
  Mr. Henson: Thank you, Miss Ironbox. You are a valued member of our
  business team, and every bit as important to this company as I am.
  Gloria Ironbox: Excellent. Mr. Griffin, why don't you come up here and
  give it a try?
  Peter: All right.
  Gloria Ironbox: The filing's done, Mr. Griffin.
  Peter: Thank you, Miss Ironbox. You are a valued member of our business
  team, and I will give you a raise tomorrow if you come to work without
  a shirt on.
  Gloria Ironbox: Mr. Griffin!
  Peter: I'm sorry. That came out wrong. Let me try again. Nice ass.
  Gloria Ironbox: You haven't heard a word I've said!
  Peter: Now that's not fair. I've heard everything you said. It's just,
  you know, there's some subtleties to the rules that aren't so easy to
  understand. Honk honk.
  Gloria Ironbox: Okay, that's it! Obviously, normal sensitivity training
  isn't enough for you! No, we're gonna have to do something drastic.
  [Crickets chirping]
  Peter: A week at a women's retreat. What the hell am I supposed to
  learn from that?
  Brian: Well, face it, Peter. Your attitude towards women isn't exactly
  enlightened.
  [streetcorner]
  Peter: Oh, that's a bad mud puddle. I wouldn't want you to step in that
  and get your nice shoes all ruined.
  [back in bedroom]
  Brian: Then you got caught peeping in the ladies' locker room.
  [locker room]
  Peter: Okay, move the towel. Move the towel. Oh! Oh! They spotted me.
  [back in bedroom]
  Lois: Peter, I think this'll be good for you. You know I love you, but
  I have to admit, there are times when I wish you were a little more
  sensitive and.... Look at me! Look at me!
  Miss Watson: Hello, ladies. I'm Miss Watson, director of the retreat.
  I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin, who's here to get in touch with his
  feminine side. This world would be a far better place if there were
  more men like him.
  Peter: Okay, okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'll be Charlie, and
  you can all be my Angels. Except you. You'll be Bosley.
  Miss Watson: We women have so much strength inside us. If we can endure
  the pain of childbirth just imagine what else we're capable of!
  Women: That's so true. Right on, sister!
  Peter: Wah, wah! Come on-it's only childbirth. How much can it hurt?
  Miss Watson: Peter, it's like taking your bottom lip and stretching it
  over your head to the back of your neck!
  Peter: Come on. You want to hear some horror stories? You wouldn't
  believe what I had to go through when Lois was pregnant.
  Lois: [Vomiting]
  [Theme from Three's Company on TV]
  Lois: [Vomiting continues]
  [Volume increases on TV]
  Miss Watson: Women are conditioned to feel competitive with each other
  when we should be supportive. Lizzie, I know you feel alone and
  unattractive since your husband left you. But you are a beautiful
  person, and I am here for you. Notice I'm making physical contact with
  her in order to establish a connection.
  Peter: I think you'd make even more of a connection if you hugged her,
  too.
  Miss Watson: Very good, Peter. That's true.
  Peter: That's it. Now rub her back. Okay, that's good. Yeah, yeah,
  comfort her. Yeah, oh yeah, you like that, don't you? Yeah, it's okay.
  It's okay to like it. It's very natural. Okay, good. Good. Now smell
  her a little.
  [Cheerful instrumental music]
  Woman: I can't do it!
  Miss Watson: Yes, you can! Trust your sisters! Jump into the trust
  quilt!
  All: Jump! Jump! Trust us! We love you! We'll catch you!
  Miss Watson: Wonderful.
  Peter: Okay! Me next! Me next! Okay, ladies. I'm gonna start with a
  Greg Louganis triple-salchow and tuck into a flying Mary Lou Retton
  half-calf. [Screaming]
  Miss Watson: Now that you've felt a woman's pain, the learning can
  begin.
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  [Two Weeks Later]
  Women: Bye!
  Lois: Welcome back, Peter.
  Peter: Lois! I missed you so much! And my babies! Chris, be a munchkin,
  and bring my bags inside, huh?
  Brian: Peter, you're...
  Peter: Brian, put the tea on. I have stories. But first, I'm gonna go
  freshen up and rinse out a few things. Oh, fudge. I broke a nail.
  Excuse me.
  Chris: Oh, my God. Dad's a chick.
  Lois: I can't remember the last time we cuddled like this.
  Peter: I can't remember the last time I loved you so much!
  Lois: How did you get so sweet?
  Peter: When I was born, my mommy dunked me in a barrel of sugar.
  Brian: Oh, for God's sake!
  Stewie: Oh, yes, I'll have the coffee cake.
  [Phone ringing]
  Quagmire: Hello?
  Peter: Hey, Quagmire.
  Quagmire: Hey, Peter. What's up?
  Peter: Not much.
  Quagmire: Well, what do you want?
  Peter: Nothin'. I'm just calling to talk. Whatcha thinking about?
  Quagmire: What do you mean, what am I thinking about? You called me!
  Peter: I just wanted to say hi. So, what are you...
  [nursery]
  Peter: Sometimes I just can't believe we could make something so
  beautiful.
  Lois: He looks just like his father.
  Peter: I really appreciate all the hard work you did giving birth and
  mothering our kids. I'll never know that joy.
  Lois: Peter, I'm sure you would've been a great mother if you had the
  chance.
  Peter: You think so?
  Lois: I know so.
  Stewie: [Suckling] [Suckling] [shuddering] [Choking and gagging]
  Lois: You know, one of these days, I'm gonna need the mirror.
  Peter: Oh, beans! I can't get this spit curl to.... Lois, what day is
  it?
  Lois: Thursday.
  Peter: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm late!
  Lois: If you spent less time fixing your hair...
  Peter: No, Lois. I'm "late" late! Do we still have that pregnancy test?
  Lois: Are you insane? You can't have a baby!
  Peter: Well, I don't have a lot of options. I'm Catholic! God, I
  thought you'd be happy!
  [kitchen]
  Peter: Oh! Oh, this is just great! Now my own wife is forced to cook
  dinner for her lousy husband?
  Lois: Peter, you're my husband! At least you used to be.
  Stewie: Oh, mother, I come bearing a gift. I'll give you a hint. It's
  in my diaper, and it's not a toaster.
  Lois: Meg, can you change Stewie?
  Meg: Fine. But this time, if a boy calls, please don't tell him I'm
  wrist deep in poopie.
  Lois: Honey, I'm glad you discovered your feminine side. But I didn't
  want you to forget about mine. Remember this? Remember?
  Peter: Oh, my God! That reminds me! I gotta give myself a breast exam.
  Uh-oh. Uh-oh! A lump! A lump! Oh, God! Oh, God! Nope, Cheeto.
  [Doorbell ringing]
  Quagmire: Lois! How expected.
  Lois: Hi, Glenn. I'm sorry to bother you. Is this a bad time?
  Quagmire: Never a bad time when you're with the Q-Man. Come on in.
  Lois: Well, as you may have noticed, Peter's been acting a little
  different lately. It was refreshing at first.
  But now...well, he doesn't even treat me like a woman anymore.
  Quagmire: I know where this is going, Lois! And I'm already semi-there.
  Oh!
  [Jazz music playing on turntable]
  Lois: Anyways, Glenn, I was wondering if you and Cleveland could help
  change Peter back to the way he was.
  Quagmire: Of course that's why you're here!
  [needle scratching on record]
  Quagmire: Don't worry, Lois. I'd do everything to you.
  Lois: What?
  Quagmire: I'd do anything for you.
  [Million Man March]
  Quagmire: Come on, Cleveland. If we're gonna re-masculate Peter, we
  need to surround him with chicks! Let's blow this sausage fest and hit
  the International House of Tail.
  Cleveland: No. He needs to learn how to respect his fellow man. That's
  what this march is all about. Respect for your fellow man.
  Peter: I can't respect men. Men are the reason our world is in such
  lousy shape. If men were as caring as women, we wouldn't have crime or
  violence.
  Jesse Jackson: My brothers, we need to stand together...
  Peter: Excuse me! I'd like to say a couple of truths to the men in this
  audience. It's your fault we have so much crime in this country! And
  it's your fault we have so much violence in this country! You are
  ruining our society, and you should be ashamed!
  [Angry mob yelling]
  Peter: Look, I don't care how many letters we gotta write. "The View"
  should be on for three hours. I mean, you just get going, and boom,
  it's News at Noon.
  Lois: Can we go soon?
  Peter: Not yet. Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia are gonna see whose
  is bigger.
  Gloria Ironbox: Peter, I'm so glad you could make it.
  Peter: Gloria, this is my life partner, Lois.
  Lois: I'm his wife.
  Gloria Ironbox: His "wife." Yes. Peter tells me you don't have a career
  of your own.
  Lois: Oh, no. Life outside my kitchen is so bright and scary. I'm just
  here because you caught me between pregnancies.
  Gloria Ironbox: Well, I'm sorry you're so hostile toward someone who's
  fighting so a woman like you can become more than just a housewife.
  Lois: Oh, just a housewife? Look, I'm all for equality but if you ask
  me, feminism is about choice. I choose to be a wife and mother. And now
  I'm choosing to end this conversation.
  Gloria Ironbox: No wonder your husband didn't respect women.
  Lois: Excuse me?
  Gloria Ironbox: I can't imagine how screwed up your kids must be.
  Lois: You bitch!
  Chef: Ten banana-cream pies!
  Peter: Holy crap! This is hot! Lois, we gotta go!
  [bedroom]
  Lois: That was wonderful.
  Peter: Who said that? Oh, hi, Lois. I'm starving. How about a sandwich?
  Lois: Glad to have you back, Peter.
  Peter: Lois, less talkie, more fetchie.
  Lois: I'm just gonna assume that's Chinese for "I love you."

  Chris: Yeah, me and Dad haven't missed a Gumbel 2 Gumbel yet.
  Lois: Well, you're gonna miss this one, young man. His report card came
  today. No more TV until your grades
  improve. Now get upstairs and study.
  Peter: Don't worry. I'll talk to her. After I get a little bit of
  courage from my old friend, Mr. Jack Daniels. [reaches for shot glass,
  then picks up phone] "Mrs. Daniels? MRS. DANIELS?!? Is Jack in? What?
  Oh, my God! When? Oh, I am so sorry." Poor old Jack. He was a wise man,
  but he just loved playing with that wheat thresher. Always playing with
  that wheat thresher!
  Lois: Honey, hold still and let me bathe you. You're filthy.
  Stewie: I'm filthy? I'm filthy?!? You're the filthy one. What do you
  say to that? How dare you!
  Lois: [Sighs]
  Peter: Hey, Stewie, I see your bum.
  Stewie: Oh, take a good look, fat man. And while you're at it, take
  pictures so I'll have something to bring to court, you wretched, filthy
  pervert.
  Peter: Hey, Lois, give Chris a break. I mean, no TV? So he failed a
  class. It's not like he felt up his cousin in the garage that
  Thanksgiving when I was 19.
  Lois: Peter, I want you to help Chris. Kids do better when parents take
  an interest in their schoolwork. I saw that on a two-part report on
  Dateline Tuesday and Dateline Gatilsday.
  Peter: What the hell is Gatilsday?
  Lois: Oh, NBC invented a new day so they could add another Dateline.
  Peter: But the Gumbel show is sacred to us. Bryant and Greg have the
  kind of father-son relationship I want me and Chris to have someday.
  Lois: Peter, Bryant and Greg Gumbel are brothers.
  Peter: Oh, nice, Lois. Just because they're black, we can't learn
  anything from them?
  Lois: Look-if Chris gets his homework done, you can watch it together
  next week. Now come on. Help me get the house ready for my mother.
  She's coming to visit for exactly one week.
  [at front door]
  Lois: Bye, Mom.
  Peter: Sheesh. What a week that was, huh?
  Peter: Okay, come on, let's watch the Gumbels.
  Lois: Peter, I thought we agreed, no TV until his homework is done.
  Chris: Mom, I'll do it after...
  Peter: Chris finished his homework. In fact, I've been helping him
  study every night this week.
  Lois: Really? Well, that's great. Enjoy your show, boys.
  Peter: You bet we will. Tonight, Katie Couric guest stars as a very
  perky crack whore.
  Chris: Hey, Dad? When you said, "Chris finished his homework," were you
  talking about me? Because if you were, I think you just lied to Mom.
  Peter: Chris, everything I say is a lie, except that and that. And
  that. And that. And that. And that. And that. And that.

  topless. I've got the goods, but have I got the guts? Find out at 11:00.
  Tom Tucker: And if you're settling in to watch Gumbel 2 Gumbel, you're
  out of luck. That show has been canceled. The full story, and maybe
  Diane's boobs, tonight at 11:00.
  Peter: I can't believe this!
  Chris: I feel sick.
  Peter: Only one thing to do, Chris. We gotta save Gumbel 2 Gumbel, and
  we're gonna do it Griffin 2 Griffin. Let's roll!
  Chris: I'm with ya, Dad. What do are we going to do, write a letter?
  Peter: No, no, I tried that once. It got me in a lot of trouble.

  not gonna be intimidated by any slick executive types. Ooh, look at Mr.
  Suave.
  Receptionist: Wait. You can't go in there.
  Peter: Just watch me!
  Receptionist: No, I mean you can't go in there, because that door leads
  nowhere. Use the door next to it.
  Peter: All right, Callaghan, me and my son want you to uncancel Gumbel
  2 Gumbel.
  Mr. Callaghan: Well, sir, we only air the show. We have nothing to do
  with it being canceled. I have all the episodes on tape. Would you like
  to borrow them?
  Peter: Okay, you bastard, you want to play rough? Until you bring the
  Gumbels back, I am going on a hunger strike. How about that, Callaghan?
  Can you live with that on your conscience? Huh? You gonna eat that
  stapler?
  Mr. Callaghan: Well, you can't eat a stapler...
  Peter: Wanna split it?

  it's gotten me in to trouble.

  Chris: Oh, you sly boots.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Chris: Are you sure this will work?
  Peter: Chris, this is just another one of your crazy schemes.
  Chris: This whole thing was your idea!
  Peter: You'll find out.
  Chris: Dad, you're not making any sense!
  Peter: You just leave that to me.
  Harris: Ah, yes. Here we go. Chris Griffin. Your dying wish is denied.
  Thank you!
  Peter: Wait a minute. My son only has a short time to live. All he
  wants is his favorite show back on TV. How can you say no?
  Harris: Mr. Griffin, everyone thinks their dying child is special. But
  these days, people who donate money to our foundation demand a little
  more bang for their buck. We need sick kids we can package. You know,
  like that one we put on Hollywood Squares.
  Contestant: I'll take the dying boy to block.
  Host: Okay. Jeremy, is there anything lower than absolute zero?
  Jeremy: Uh, yeah. My white-cell count.
  [Audience laughing]
  Peter: I'm telling you, Chris is dying ten times worse than those other
  kids. He's got a very rare disease called tumor-syphilis-itis-osis.
  Harris: Sounds sexy. What are the symptoms?
  Peter: What are the symptoms? Take a look! He's growing nipples all
  over his body!
  Harris: They look like pepperonis.
  Peter: Who do you think you are? My son happens to be very sensitive
  about his extra nipples. See, look. They're coming right off. Nipples
  shouldn't just come off like that.
  Harris: Why, that's the sickest boy I've ever seen! Get me the
  president of television!
  [Spectacular instrumental music]
  Man 1: How about this? A single white girl in the city working at a
  magazine!
  ALL: Yeah, that's good. That's at least a twelve share.
  Man 2: Do you guys hear yourselves? This is the same old crap over and
  over again. We need to take a chance. Try something different.
  Something fresh.
  Receptionist: Excuse me.
  Executive: No calls!
  Receptionist: It's about a dying boy.
  Executive: Hello? Well, what's he got? Sounds sexy. Get me exclusive
  rights to his death and you got a deal.
  Harris: Well, congratulations, Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air!
  Chris: All right, Dad!
  Harris: Mr. Griffin, I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances.
  Peter: Are you kidding? I may see you again. I got two more kids at
  home, and I've always wanted to see some new episodes of Star Trek.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Lois: Stewie, it's bath time. You're filthy again.
  Stewie: I'll show you filthy! Yes, look at me! I'm a dirty, foul little
  boy! I'm a nasty, squalid little hobo! I say, Mother, you have your
  work cut out for you now, don't you?
  Lois: Okay, if you want to be dirty, be dirty.
  Stewie: Where do you think you're going? I've defiled myself. I need to
  be cleaned! Aah!
  Peter: There you go, kiddo. All clean.
  Stewie: Blast! I'm frozen! I'm hypothermic! Bloody hell, I'm a woman!
  Mr. McCloud: Take out your pencils and start your test.
  Chris: Uh, Mr. McCloud, I didn't study for the test, but I got a good
  reason. I'm dying.
  Mr. McCloud: Griffin, that's the lamest excuse I've heard since
  Steinberg's Jewish High Holiday crap. Steinberg! Take that hat off in
  my classroom!
  Chris: But Mr. McCloud, I'm really dying. I have a certificate to prove
  it.
  Mr. McCloud: My God! Tumor-syphilis-itis-osis! And he still comes into
  school! You're excused from the test, you brave, brave boy. Steinberg,
  you can learn something from this fine young...damn it, Steinberg! Take
  that hat off!
  Meg: Dad, Marcy Gibbons just called and she heard that Chris is dying!
  [crying]
  Peter: [Laughing] Your brother's okay. That was just a little white lie
  me and Chris came up with to save a TV show.
  Meg: So, he's not going to die?
  Peter: No! [Laughing] Boy, your face was priceless when you thought he
  was. [Pretending to cry]
  Brian: You're a monster.
  Peter: Hey, Chris was in on the whole thing. Anyway, it's over and done
  with.
  [Guitar playing folk music]
  Peter: What the hell is that?
  Singers: ? Oh, dyin' boy of Quahog? ?Chris Griffin, you're so brave?
  ?There's a smile on your face and a bounce in your step? ?as they dig
  your grave? ?as they dig your grave. ?
  Lois: Do I hear singing?
  Peter: Nope! No singing. Just us watching another hilarious episode of
  Good Times. You know, the sitcom that's funnier when you play it really
  loud.
  JJ: Maxine is the lady who's feeling all right, thanks to the magic of
  Kid Dynomite!
  [Audience laughing on TV]
  James: Junior, where you been? Dinner was three hours ago!
  Florida: Oh, forget him, James. He's an idiot!
  JJ: Mama, what's wrong with you?
  Florida: What's wrong with me? My name is Florida! Florida! That's the
  name of a state! Why is my name Florida? [crying] Oh, Lord!
  JJ: Dynomite!
  Lois: That is singing. Peter, there's a candlelight vigil on our front
  lawn.
  Peter: Lois, that's ridiculous. There's nobody out there. You must be
  seeing things.
  Lois: Peter, why are these people here?
  Chris: ?As they dig my grave, as they dig my grave? Hey, Dad, they're
  singing a song about me! Oh, hi, Mom.
  [Doorbell rings]
  Harris: Hello, Mr. Griffin. We just came by to see if your son's taken
  a media-friendly turn for the worse.
  Peter: No. Everything's fine. Thanks for checking. Bye-bye.
  Harris: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mr. Griffin, the foundation held up its end
  of the bargain and got that crappy Gumbel show back on the air! You owe
  us a body!
  Lois: What?
  Peter: Uh, excuse me for a minute.
  Lois: You pretended Chris was dying to save a TV show? You're a monster!
  Brian: Thank you.
  Lois: Peter. You tell that man the truth!
  Peter: Uh, just out of curiosity...
  Harris: Shoot.
  Peter: What happens if he's not really dying?
  Harris: You go to jail for defrauding a charitable organization.
  Peter: Oh, that's interesting. Will you excuse us? You're right!
  There's only one way out of this! Chris is all better! I cured him!
  Harris: You cured him?
  Peter: That's right. I have divine powers! Okay. Safe drive. Well, what
  do you have to say to that? I'm not going to jail, Chris doesn't have
  to die, and best of all, Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air.
  Lois: Oh, you're a great role model, Peter. What kind of man devalues
  the life of his child for a TV show?
  Peter: Lois, anyone who wouldn't pretend their own son is dying to get
  the Gumbels back on TV is a racist. There, I said it.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Woman: It's him! It's Peter Griffin! The miracle healer of Quahog! Oh,
  heal me, O great one!
  Lois: You see what your lies have gotten youe? They think you're some
  kind of healer.
  Peter: I'll handle it, Lois. I read a book about this sort of thing
  once.
  Brian: Are you sure it was a book? Are you sure it wasn't nothing?
  Peter: Oh, yeah.
  Lois: Peter, these poor, deluded people think you have divine powers.
  Man 1: Praise Peter!
  Woman 1: We are your servants.
  Woman 2: It's a miracle!
  Man 2: What would you have us do, O great healer of Quahog?
  Peter: Well, there's really no need to do anythi-paint my house.
  Lois: Peter, it's bad enough to lie to your family, but how can you let
  these people think you're a healer? This is pure exploitation.
  Peter: No, it's not. Those films my cousin Rufus used to do were pure
  exploitation.
  Announcer: From the cats who brought you Caddyblack, Blackdraft and
  Black Kramer v. Kramer, comes a funky flick so bad you gonna say,
  "Damn, that's funky."
  [Funk music playing]
  Rufus Griffin: Oh, you out of time, baby.
  Pimp: Damn!
  Announcer: Rufus Griffin stars in Black to the Future. We talking Marty
  McSuperfly, dig?
  Lorraine: Marty, I want to be your fine, sweet-ass bitch.
  Pimp: Damn! Brother done kissed his mama!
  [Playing funk music]
  Announcer: Oh, yeah.
  Man: Get me Isaac Hayes. Isaac, you know that new sound you been
  looking for? Well, listen to this!
  Peter: Come on, Lois. Stop being such a stick in the mud. Look, I'm
  giving these saps hope. And I'm getting the house painted for free.
  It's win-freakin'-win, baby.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Peter: Hey, flathead, chop-chop.
  Man: [Exclaiming]
  Man 2: [Sighing]
  Peter: Hey, great job on the lawn. Now do it again, and this time leave
  it a little longer.
  Chris: Hey, Dad. Hurry up. You're missing Gumbel 2 Gumbel. They caught
  the guy, and now they're interviewing him.
  Bryant Gumbel: Purse snatching: society's fault, or one man's cry for
  help?
  Robber: What are you talking about? I wanted her freakin' money.
  Bryant Gumbel: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
  Robber: What the hell's wrong with him?
  Bryant Gumbel: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
  Peter: Some other time, Chris. Now, where's my shoes?
  [Sighing]
  Lois: Peter, these people are worshipping you. Don't you think there's
  someone who might resent that? A being who's all-knowing and
  all-powerful?
  Peter: Well, someone's got a pretty high opinion of herself.
  Lois: Not me, Peter. God. The real God.
  Peter: Look, what's the big deal? So I told a little fib, and now
  people think I'm God. I mean, when did God ever say He didn't want
  someone else being worshipped like Him?
  Lois: It's one of the Ten Commandments.
  Peter: Oh, come on, Lois. Those were written, like, 200 years ago.
  Times have changed!
  Lois: [screams]
  Peter: Okay, let's stay calm.
  Peter: Ah, Lois, if you're scared, I'll hold you close until the lights
  are on again.
  Chris: Dad, it's me.
  Peter: Go to your room.
  Lois: Well, that's the last of them. I still don't know how every light
  bulb could go out at the same time. Oh, my God.
  Peter: Yes?
  Lois: Peter, that's not funny. Those fanatics are building a golden
  idol of you on our lawn.
  Peter: Wow, I look like a freakin' Emmy. Hint-hint.
  Brian: Ah! Damn it to hell! This is embarrassing. I seem to have fleas.
  Lois: That's never happened before.
  Chris: Morning.
  Peter: Geez, Chris, puberty hit you like a ton of bricks.
  Chris: What do you mean? Ah!
  Lois: Don't you see what's happening?
  Peter: Of course I do, Lois. Our fresh-faced little boy is becoming a
  pock-marked, hideously disfigured man.
  Sunrise. Sunset.
  Brian: No, no, no, Peter. The light bulbs last night, my fleas, Chris'
  pimples. They're just like darkness, gadflies, and boils. Three of the
  plagues God visited upon Egypt when the Pharaoh angered him in the Old
  Testament.
  Peter: Oh, come on, Brian, there's a logical explanation for all those
  things. There was a power surge, you don't bathe, and Chris has had
  acne problems since the fourth grade. Ah, the kids were all calling him
  Crisco and Pizza Face and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry. Remember, Chris?
  Chris: Now I do. [Crying]
  Meg: [screams]
  Lois: Meg, what's wrong?
  Meg: I was giving Stewie a bath, and...and....
  Peter: Trust me, Meg, at his age, it's strictly involuntary.
  Meg: No! The water, it turned all red and goopy, like blood!
  Lois: Blood?
  Stewie: How positively delightful. It's as if someone stabbed Mr.
  Bubble!
  Lois: My baby! Get out there and tell those people the truth. Make them
  stop worshipping you before it starts hailing in my house!
  Peter: There's gotta be an explanation for all this!
  Brian: You want an explanation? God. Is. Pissed!
  Peter: Ah! Let's get out of here!
  [Eerie instrumental music] [Sinister instrumental music]
  Peter: Stop it! Stop it! Stop worshipping me! I'm just a big fake, like
  the moon landing and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights, and Tom Cruise
  and Nicole Kidman! Oh, I don't mean that completely untrue gay rumor.
  They're just both really phony, just like me. I'm sorry, okay? Now make
  it stop.
  [All screaming]
  Brian: Peter, this is the final plague!
  Peter: Good, 'cause this is starting to get really old.
  Brian: Peter, the final plague is the death of the first-born son.
  Peter: Oh, no! Stewie!
  Brian: The first-born son.
  Peter: Meg.
  Brian: Your wife.
  Peter: Chris!
  Lois: Chris!
  Peter: Oh, my God. Are you okay?
  Chris: Hey, Dad, I can see a white light at the end of a long tunnel.
  Peter: Oh, that's great, son. Light is good. Run towards the light.
  Lois: No, Chris, no! Run away from the light!
  Chris: Hey, Dad, do you think they got Gumbel 2 Gumbel in heaven?
  Peter: Yes, son, and there's no reruns or commercials, and Kirstie
  Alley is still hot and all those scrambled channels come in clear as a
  bell. Please don't take him, God. I'm sorry.
  Angel: Sir, we think the Griffin guy gets it.
  God: Good, good. Peggy, turn off the plagues, please.
  Peggy: Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson.
  God: She's new.
  [Awe-inspiring instrumental music]
  Brian: I think the plagues went away.
  Chris: So did the white light.
  Lois: Oh, honey!
  Peter: Thank God! I mean, thank me! Kidding! It was a joke! It was a
  joke! Ah!
  [Frog croaking]
  [closing theme music]



Title: Running Mates

STEWIE
   [Stewie sat in garden eating soil] I say Rupert, these
  crumpets you've prepared look positively divine. Ehemm, mmm! Excellent
  texture, provocative support. Try another you say? Well aren't I the
  wicked one.
  LOIS
   Stewie, I told you before don't eat dirt. It's disgusting.
  STEWIE
   Oh, and I suppose the bilios curds you force fed me from your
  teat were perfectly fine then.
  LOIS
  Glenn would you mind holding Stewie?
  QUAGMIRE
   Heh heh said and done. Well hey there spud with the mud.
  STEWIE
   Oh good Lord do you bathe in Aqua Velva?
  CLEVELAND
   Hi Lois. You've got our votes.
  LOIS
   Thank you Cleveland. Someone has to run against that awful
  Betsy Labowe. She actually opposes background checks for new teachers.
  God knows who she might hire.
         
  [Flash to a math classroom]
  TEACHER
  So, the square of the hypotenuse which we will label
  “C” making the sides opposite, both of the acute
  angles “A” and “B” will always
  equal the sum of the other sides. [Teacher hands a student a note that
  reads, “do you like me?”]  Any questions?
  LOIS
   It's just something I have to do. Even if winning means
  spending time out of the house and away from my family.
  STEWIE
   Out of the house. Why I'd be free from your oppressive
  gynocracy. What the deuce are you standing here for? You should be out
  giving speeches shaking hands and kissing babies. [Lois kisses him] Not
  this baby.
  PETER
   Hey Lois, you seen my pants? [Laughter from studio audience]
  Boy will I be glad when that studio audience moves out of town.
  PETER
   Hey Lois, what's with the sign?
  LOIS
   Peter, we discussed this. I'm running for school board. You
  never listen to me.
  PETER
   Oh yeah, I remember. Hey Cleveland, hey Quagmire... hey Lois,
  what's with the sign?
  BRIAN
   You guys. Chris' principle just called. Chris is in trouble.
  STUDIO AUDIENCE
  Oooooohhhh.
  PETER
   Oh, that's it I'm calling the cops.
         
  [Peter, Lois and Chris in the Principle's office.]
  PRINCIPLE
  Mr. Griffin I'm afraid I have some bad news. I caught your son peeking
  into the girl’s locker room.
  LOIS
  Oh Chris!
  PETER
   So what's the big deal? It's normal for boys his age to be
  curious. I remember when I first noticed girls starting to develop.
         
  [Flashback - a young Peter is sat in a school auditorium]
  PRINCIPLE
  Welcome to 8th grade orientation everyone [breasts start to sprout on
  all the females around Peter and then on Peter himself] uhmm locker
  assignments will be handed out in the library after lunch
  period.  Uh, if you have any questions about your locker
  assignment or class schedule, uh please come…
         
  [Outside the Principle's office]
  LOIS
   We'll continue this discussion tonight young man. A women is
  not an object.
  PETER
   Your mother's right son. Listen to what it says.
  LOIS
   Peter!
  PETER
   Uhhh… I didn't say that. Lee Majors did.
  LEE MAJORS
  What? Women are things.
  PETER
   Oh my God. It's Mr. Fargas. He was my favorite teacher.
         
  [Flashback - Peter is sat in one of Mr. Fargas' classes]
  MR. FARGAS
   Take out your scalpels kids, today we're going to
  dissect… a clown! Well, no wonder this clown died. His lungs
  are filled with candy.
  LOIS
  Wow, why don’t you go say hello?  I’m
  gonna drop off some campaign flyers in the teachers lounge.
  PETER
   Hey hey Mr. Fargas, It's me Peter Griffin.
  MR. FARGAS
  Griffin, Griffin. Sorry not on the list.
  PETER
   Aww don't you remember me? I was your favorite student. You
  taught me everything. Math, science. You even taught me how to dance
  just in time for the prom.
         
  [Flashback - Peter being taught how to dance by Mr. Fargas]
  MR. FARGUS
  Well Peter you start like this!
              
  [Dances]
  PETER
  Like this?
              
  [Dances]
  MR. FARGUS
  Yeah now add a little turn and do a buckin-whit
  PETER
  Come on Mr. Fargus do the whole darn thing!
         
  [End flashback]
  PETER
   Geeze what happened to you? Someone give you a funectamy?
  MR. FARGAS
   No, they gave me these by order of the school board. They
  said it evens me out. Sorry to fly off the handle like that.
  PETER
   Let me see that… [Throws pills away] That is what
  I think of you taking chill pills from the man. The old Farge made
  learning fun and that’s what these kids need.  Now
  get back in that classroom and teach your Farging ass off.
         
  [Back at the Griffin's house, Peter is stood outside Chris'
  door.  Hears a weird noise…]
         
  [Peter knocks on the door]
  CHRIS
   Don't come in… just a minute!
  PETER
   Chris, you mother wants me and you to have a talk
  [Peter opens door]
  CHRIS
   [Bouncing ball on paddle] Aww I was going for a new record.
  PETER
   Now son as men it's only natural for us to look at naked
  girls. Every man does it, even Mr. Rogers.
  MR. ROGERS
  [Looking through binoculars] Hello neighbor... awwww.
  PETER
   But peeping can be dangerous, so I brought you this [box of
  porno mags].
  CHRIS
   Wow Miss December.
  PETER
   Heh, yep. The old skin bin. Now you can look at naked girls
  all you want and it's perfectly legal.
  CHRIS
  Wow, check out the rack on... Mom?
  PETER
   Hey give me that… just a little present your mom
  gave me for our anniversary. Heheh...
  CHRIS
   Alright Dad!  Hey Dad, thanks.
         
         
  [Peter leaves, closes door, hears that noise again, and realizes he has
  Chris’s pattle]
         
  [In the kitchen]
  MEG
   Mom, If you get elected to the school board can you fix it so
  I win Homecoming Queen?
  LOIS
   Oh honey, of course I can. But winning without honor isn't
  really winning at all isn't that right Milli?
  MILLI
  No it's just as good. [Dances]
  STEWIE
   Cease this prattling! This campaign literature must be posted
  today if we are going to get you into office and out of my life you
  festering strumpet.
  PETER
   Hey you guys… hey Lois, you running for school
  board?
  MEG
   Look Chris' school is on TV [Meg points at television].
  DIANE
   The egg drop; an annual tradition for junior high school
  science students.
  TOM
   But today, an egg drop conducted by teacher Randal Fargas
  seems to have gone horribly horribly wrong. We now go live to action
  news 5 Asian correspondent Trisha Takanowa.
  TRICIA
  Well Tom the eggs being dropped behind me are not chicken eggs but
  those of the endangered California condor.
  PETER
   Welcome back Fargas.
  LOIS
   Oh my God. He's gonna wipe that species off the face of the
  earth.
  PETER
   No Lois the janitor will do that.
  TRICIA
  Tom, I'm getting word that the Quahog school board has just dismissed
  Randal Fargas effectively ending his 32 year teaching career.
  PETER
   What? They can't do that.
  LOIS
   Peter, the man is obviously unbalanced.
  DIANE
   In other news, Betsy Labowe a candidate for school board
  president announced today she is pulling out of the race. 
  Labowe’s withdrawal now leaves housewife Lois Griffin running
  unopposed.
  LOIS
   Oh my goodness I win by default!
  PETER
   Oh great you can give Fargas his job back!
  LOIS
   I'm sorry but I do have a mind of my own and I happen to
  agree with the school boards decision.
  PETER
   Yeah, yeah I know you're a feminist and I think that's
  adorable but this is grown up time and I'm the man.
  LOIS
   I'm not giving that lunatic his job back and that’s
  final.
  PETER
   Lois, I can't let you deprive our children of a fine teacher
  like Mr. Fargas! I’m going to stop you the only way I
  can… by killing you... in the race for school board
  president.
         
  [In the front garden, Peter is putting up signs for the poll]
  BRIAN
   Peter, are you sure running against Lois is such a good idea?
  You know how competitive you get.
  PETER
   Hey, hey I can be just as noncompetitive as anybody. In fact
  I’m the most noncompetitive, so I win.
  BRIAN
   Come on you can't even handle losing at checkers.
         
  [Flashback - Peter and Brian are playing Checkers]
  BRIAN
   King me.
  PETER
   Um, hHey look over there.
  BRIAN
   What?
  [Peter grabs board, throws it in the trunk, drives car off cliff, then
  shoots car].
         
  [In the garden]
  LOIS
   Peter since when do you care about the school board?
  PETER
   Lois, Mr. Fargas is getting a bum rap and if running against
  you is the only way to get him back into the classroom then I'm going
  to run like the 6 million dollar man.
         
  [Flash - 6 Million Dollar Man]
  MAN
  We can rebuild him. We have the technology. But I don't want to spend a
  lot of money.
         
  [In the garden.]
  LOIS
   Fine if you feel that strongly then by all means run. But I'm
  warning you I'm not going to pull any punches on the issues.
  PETER
   Oh I'm Lois, look at me with my big ideas and my pointy nose.
  nana nana na.
  LOIS
   Oh boy, this will be even easier then running unopposed.
  PETER
   Is that so? Well I'm not only gonna beat you. I'm gonna eat
  your nose.
  LOIS
   See you on the campaign trail.
         
  [Candidate parade]
         
  [Brian and Stewie in the conservatory]
  STEWIE
   Oh my, look where my hand is... I say look where my hand is.
  It's in a very naughty place [finger in nose] Does this not disgust you?
  BRIAN
   Kid you're talking to a guy who uses his tongue for toilet
  paper.
  STEWIE
   Now look her you loathsome cur. The matron oppressor has left
  me in your ward. You should be striving to thwart my loathsome misdeeds.
  STEWIE
   Look at me, I’m writing profanity on the wall
  [poopycock]
  BRIAN
   Water soluble.
  STEWIE
   Don't just sit there I have misbehaved. I've been a bawdy
  little monkey.
  STEWIE
   If that vile woman were here she'd prove a worthy adversary.
  BRIAN
  What's the matter? Miss your mommy?
  STEWIE
   oh yes that's it. That's quite good. Yes I miss my mommy. I
  also miss colic and rectal thermometry.
  BRIAN
   Whatever you say... mama's boy.
  STEWIE
   Blast!
         
  [Quahog High School]
  BOY
  Hey Chris, Hector found two rocks that look like boobs, you in?
  CHRIS
   Who needs rocks when you've got these. [Shows porno mags].
  BOYS
  Wow [Cover themselves]
         
  [Peter, Quagmire and Cleveland in a car campaigning]
  PETER
   Vote for Peter Griffin
  QUAGMIRE
   Woah, look at all of Lois' signs. Talk about seeing red. Oh!
  CLEVELAND
   Peter, I'm concerned that your candidacy may have become a
  lost cause. The debate is tonight and you don't seem to have any
  supporters.
  PETER
   Don't sweat it boys. The Griffin men have always been
  winners, dating back to my dominative great Grandfather, Juarez Griffin.
         
  [Flashback - Cock fight]
  PETER
   Fella's the debates in the bag, alright? If there's one thing
  I can do is play to a crowd.
         
  [Debate on the television]
  ANNOUNCER
  Lois Griffin, daughter of shipping magnet Carter Pugersmit and passive
  aggressivist Barbara Pugersmit. Tonight she takes on her greatest
  challenge. Peter Griffin, Quahogs' native son, self described
  huger-naught whatever the hell that means and community activist.
  CHRIS
   Go Dad.
  MEG
   He can't hear you.
  CHRIS
   GO DAD!
  ANNOUNCER
  Fasten your seatbelts; we're just minutes away from Lois vs. Peter.
  Griffin vs. Griffin on Monday Night Debate yall.
         
  [In Stewie's bedroom]
  [Brian reading Stewie a story]
  STEWIE
   No, no, no you’re doing it wrong. When you read
  fast you're supposed to read Metastopholes in a scary voice…
  like this.
  BRIAN
   Oh is that how your mommy reads it?
  STEWIE
   I do not miss that ogress. She can burn in hell for all I
  care.
  BRIAN
  Sure she can.
         
  [Brian walks out of the room, Stewie breaks into song]
  STEWIE
   Damn, Damn, Damn, I've grown accustom to her face.
   She almost makes the day begin.
   I've grown accustom to the tune she whistles night and noon.
   Her smiles her frowns her ups her downs are second nature to
  me now
   Like breathing out and breathing in
   I'm very grateful she's a woman
   And so easy to forget
   Rather like a habit one can always break.
   And yet, I've grown accustom to her looks
   Accustom to her voice
   Accustom to her face

  Awww…
  STEWIE
   DAMN YOU ALL!
         
  [At the debate]
  TOM
   Mr. Griffin, your opening statement please.
  PETER
   Ok, uh, I'm Peter Griffin vote for me.
  TOM
   Is that it?
  PETER
   Ah. No, this is it. This is life, the one you get so go and
  have a ball because the world don't move to the beat of just on drum.
  What might be right for you may not be right for some. You take the
  good, you take the bad you take the both and there you have my opening
  statement… Sit boy sit. Good dog.
  DIANE
  Okay, Mrs. Griffin
  LOIS
   Well as a piano teacher I know how difficult the education
  process can be; that's why if I'm elected I promise to fight for
  competent teachers and a better funded music department and updated
  textbooks that don't refer to the civil rights movement as trouble
  ahead.
  DIANE
   Mr. Griffin, your response.  Maybe something about
  education.
  PETER
   I've always cared deeply about young people as a rich
  college-bound student I once joined some under-privileged in saving a
  community center from being converted into a shopping mall.
         
         
  [Applause]
  LOIS
   Peter, that wasn't you that was Adalfa Shabadu in Breakin 2:
  Electric Boogaloo. You watched it last night.
         
  [Audience booing]
  PETER
   So you’re calling me a liar, eh?  Well
  I’m gonna take the high road and stick to the
  issues.  The children of Quahog are our greatest treasure.
  They deserve a school board president who doesn't leave her feminine
  ointments in the fridge next to the mustard. That was the worst hotdog
  I ever ate. She flosses in bed. She snores like a wilder beast.
  TOM
  Thank-you Mr. Griffin that’s…
  PETER
  Wait a second I’m not done yet.  She freed Willie
  Horton. She nailed Donna Rice.
  LOIS
   Peter, that's enough.
  PETER
   Eats babies.
         
  [Applause, audience chants Peter]
  LOIS
   Just a minute, listen to me please!  This election
  is about our children’s future. So ask yourselves what kind
  of future will it be if we elect a man who has never taught a student
  or attended a PTA meeting. This is a man who believes the plural of
  goose is sheep. I'm the right person for the job. Vote for me.
  AUDIENCE
  Lois Lois Lois!
  PETER
   Wait I'm not done... Peter. Peter. Peter... Hey shut up. Just
  shut up.
         
  [In the kitchen of the Griffin's house.]
  LOIS
   Well I didn't enjoy humiliating Peter but what choice did I
  have?
  BRIAN
   That’s ok Lois, I enjoyed it.
  LOIS
   Ugh, as soon as the polls close we can put all of this
  ugliness behind us.
  PETER
   [TV ad] Lois Griffin is a slut.
  LOIS
   What?
  PETER
   Hi. I'm Peter Griffin. You know I grew up in this town.
  Quahog needs a moral upstanding school board president, someone we can
  trust. Well a lot of nasty things have been said during this campaign
  but pictures are better than words because some words are big and hard
  to understand. But here's something everyone can understand. [shows
  picture of Lois in revealing pose] Do you really want your children's
  future in the hands of this? I know I don't.
         
  [Quahog 5 News]
  TOM
   Lewd, obsence and a little blurry; just some off the words
  used to
  describe Lois Griffins' purent pic.  Hello, I’m Tom
  Tucker.
  DIANE
   And I’m Diane Simmons.  Yesterday voters
  overwhelmingly declared that Lois Griffin is not the kind of person we
  want running their schools. Her husband Peter Griffin was elected by a
  landslide.
         
  [School hall]
  PETER
   Oh, hat a great day. I just wanna say… I wanna say
  (hic) I am so friggin wasted.
         
  [The lounge]
  STEWIE
   [in his head] Splendid how delightful it will be to have
  mother back.
  BRIAN
  I heard that.
  STEWIE
   Damn!
  CHRIS
   Don't feel bad mom. All my friends think you're hot. They
  can't believe I came out of you.
  PETER
   Hey Lois, I've got a joke for you. How many losers does it
  take to make me breakfast? One. Just you. Hahaha. I’m just
  kidding, but French toast please.
  LOIS
   Don't even talk to me Peter. You humiliated your own wife and
  for what, just to get that crazy Mr. Fargas back in the classroom?
  PETER
   Who?
  LOIS
   Peter I care about our schools, all you care about was some
  stupid competition.  Well winning was only half the battle. If
  you blow this chance to do something good for our kids you will big the
  biggest loser I know.
  PETER
   Oh yeah? Peter Griffin is no a loser. When I get done our
  students will be so smart they will be able to program their VCRs
  without spilling piping hot gravy all over myself.
         
  [Quahog High School]
  TRICIA
  This is Tricia Takanahra here with school board president Peter
  Griffin. Mr. President you've accomplished so much in just a few short
  weeks.
  PETER
   Thanks Connie. I'm very excited about our progress in revamp.
  PETER
   For starters we're making sex education more fun.
  School House Rock: Vagina junction whets your function
  School House Rock: Taking in sperm and spitting out babies.
  PETER
   And our schools are the safest around thanks to the hall
  monitor XLK.
  XLK
  Halt, present school pass.
  STUDENT
  Right here.
  XLK
   Second request, present hall pass.
  STUDENT
  Right here…
  XLK
  Security breach, security breach.
  [XLK starts shooting at her].
  PETER
   I guess little miss free spirit will think twice before
  roaming the halls.
  PETER
   And I've restocked our school library with books of our
  greatest movies and TV shows because if we don't teach our kids to
  read, how will they ever know what's on.
  TRICIA
  Mr. Griffin this is impressive, I’ve never seen kids so
  enthusiastic about reading.
  PETER
  Thank you, thank you, hey that’s what you voted for.
  PETER
   Hey son show the folks at home what you got there.
  TRICIA
  Good Lord, that's a dirty magazine.
  PETER
   Hey, that's mine. There might be a mineshaft under this
  library.
  GUY
  My God, all these kids are looking at pornography
  TRICIA
   What kind of pervert gave you all this thilth?
  STUDENT
  Chris Griffin. He got it from his dad.
         
  [Everyone is shocked and looks to Peter]
         
  [In the Griffin's house]
  CLEVELAND
   Oh there's quite a crowd outside. I haven't witnessed
  pandemonium like this since Ridiculous Day down at the deli, when
  prices were so low they were ridiculous.
  QUAGMIRE
  You said it paly, that’s why I brought in the big
  guns.  Say how do to the ragin cagin Mr. James Carville.
  PETER
   Ahh. Ow. Geeze did somebody open the Ark of the Covenant?
  JAMES CARVILLE
  Now now see Peter what you gotta do is declare war.  War you
  see war is your only chance in surviving this scandalous is to claim
  that Lois gave your boy a pornography.
  QUAGMIRE
  And he’s right, heh, give em the old ball and chain.
  PETER
   I can't do that Lois is mad enough at me. Oh God I'm sorry I
  can't look at you. I can handle ugly but this is just like circus ugly.
         
  [House basement]
  PETER
   Lois I need your help you gotta come to my press conference
  this afternoon.
  LOIS
  Heh.
  PETER
  I could lose my presidency.
  LOIS
   Too bad, I’ve already lost more than that.
  PETER
   Not my rainbow colored socks with the individual toes.
  LOIS
   No I've lost my respect for you.
  PETER
   Oh... ‘cause I need those socks.
         
  [The press conference]
  TOM
  We now take you live to Peter Griffin Jr. High where a battle for
  School board Peter Griffin is fighting for his political life.

  MEG
   Mom, what are you doing here? I thought you were mad at dad.
  LOIS
   I am I just came to see him twist in the wind.
  CHRIS
   Are you and dad gonna get a divorce?
  LOIS
   Oh honey... maybe.
  PETER
   A parent giving porno to their kid is a terrible thing, but
  I'm here to tell you I'm innocent. I didn't give those magazines to my
  son. My wife... my wife… Lois [people in audience morph into
  Lois] Lois! [Sees James Carville] Ahhh! Ah crap! My wife Lois is the
  most important person in the world to me. I gave my son those
  magazines. Even worse I turned a beautiful gift from Lois into
  something cheap. I just wanted to win so bad. Now I know there are some
  things more important than winning. Lois I only hope that you can find
  it in your heart to forgive me.
  LOIS
   Oh Peter.
  TRICIA
  You're saying you're not only a bad father, but a bad husband too?
  REPORTER
  Do you have the moral authority to leave?
  PETER
   Yes, no, and screw it I resign.

Title: A Picture is Worth a 1000 Bucks

Lois Griffin: Where's Brian? Breakfast is getting cold.
  Announcer: In tonight's episode the part of Brian the Dog will be
  played by Carter Banks. (Carter banks comes out in a dog suit)
  Carter Banks: Here I am. Sorry I...
  Lois Griffin: (Whispering) Camera Two.
  Carter Banks: Sorry, I overslept.
  Stewie Griffin: Yes. Do you want breakfast? Or would you rather chew on
  your own ass as usual? (Pauses, then clears throat) I'm sure you have
  something to say to that.
  Carter Banks: Oh, God. Sorry. Can you give me the line again? Not the
  whole line. Just the end.
  Stewie Griffin: Let's cut! You're sleeping with which producer? God! As
  soon as my movie deal kicks in, I am such a ghost!
  Theme Song
  Lois Griffin: You can take off your blindfold now. We're almost there.
  Peter Griffin: Not yet. I don't want to ruin my birthday surprise. Lois
  Griffin Then at least let me drive! Peter Griffin Lois, you know it's
  illegal for women to drive.
  [Cat screeches] 
  Peter Griffin A woman driving. That's adorable. Lois Griffin Peter, I
  don't think- Peter, please! I'm begging you! Stop the car! We're here!
  Thank God. Peter Griffin Bob's Funland and Putt Putt Golf? The grownup
  in me likes the prospect of fun. But the kid in me is suicidal over
  what a fat bastard I'll become! All Happy birthday! Peter Griffin I
  can't believe it! Quagmire, Cleveland, Joe! Who are you? Angry Guy I'm
  the guy whose car you just slammed into! Peter Griffin Lois, you
  invited everyone!
  [Screams from roller coaster] 
  Peter Griffin Excuse me. Excuse me. My friend is differently abled. May
  he go ahead of you? Woman Of course. Peter Griffin Frontsies, backsies,
  backsies, backsies. Quagmire Well, hello. You must be this beautiful to
  ride the Quagmire. Bonnie Swanson Careful, Joe! Joe Swanson Kiss off!
  Yeah! Bonnie Swanson Your father. Sometimes I don't think he'll be
  happy until he's completely paralyzed. Stewie Griffin How deliciously
  evil looking! It's like something out of Stephen King! Stephen King
  Okay. For my 307th book...this couple is attacked by a...lamp monster!
  Executive You're not even trying anymore, are you? When can I have it?
  Carnival Attendant A lot. Stewie Griffin A 10-gauge. I've never handled
  one of these before. Stewie Griffin Ah! Yes! [Singing] "This is my
  rifle, this is my gun This is for fighting, this is for fun" Cleveland
  Oh, dang. Now I hate windmills even more. Peter Griffin Let me give you
  a little tip, pallie. The shortest distance between two points is the
  full-body English, high-arcing rainbow shot.
  [Glass shattering] 
  Bull I know what you're thinking.
  [Window breaking] 
  Bob Funland Sir, I'm gonna have to ask your party to leave. You've
  caused nothing but trouble since you got here! Perhaps we should just
  continue the party at some other type of location. Peter Griffin No.
  Wait. I know this guy. We went to high school together. Bob Funland We
  did? Peter Griffin He was a loser then, and he's a loser now. We used
  to kid this guy all the time. All Bob misses his mommy! Bob misses his
  mommy! Peter Griffin We're not going just because some pissant tells us
  to. I demand to see the owner! Bob Funland That's me. I'm Bob Funland.
  Peter Griffin You own this whole place? Bob Funland That's right! This
  place is my legacy! So what have you done with your life, you jerk?
  Peter Griffin I'm Neptune, God Of The Sea! I sink ships and conjure up
  storms! Neptune No, you're not. I am. And you know nothing of my work.
  [Crickets chirping] 
  Peter Griffin Look at this, Lois. See? Right here. I was voted Most
  Likely To Succeed. Lois Griffin Peter, that's not you. That's not even
  a yearbook. That's a People magazine. Peter Griffin I wondered why they
  had the wrong picture and name. Lois Griffin Can't we just enjoy the
  rest of your birthday? Look. It says, "Happy Birthday, Daddy. Love,
  Stewie." Stewie Griffin Let me see that! Did you forge my name? Is that
  backward "S" supposed to be cute? I'm going to crap double for you
  tonight! Peter Griffin Face it, Lois. I'm a nobody. Why can't I be
  famous like Bob? Or my cousin, Kathy Griffin? Kathy Griffin Okay. Then
  I got on Suddenly Susan. And that was really cool. And I still do
  standup. And people laugh and give me money. Isn't this great catching
  up? Anyway, I was in college... Lois Griffin She's still talking. Peter
  Griffin I don't get it. I poured it in her drink. Kathy Griffin His
  name was Steve Rock. It was cool. He was my first black man. Peter
  Griffin Oh, boy. Kathy Griffin But I went everywhere! Chris Griffin
  Don't be depressed, Dad. Here. I made you a present. Brian Griffin My
  God! It's good. Really good. Chris Griffin It's partly an expression of
  my teenage angst. But mostly it's a moo cow! Lois Griffin It's lovely,
  Chris. Go ahead, Peter. Make a wish. Peter Griffin I'd sell my soul to
  be famous! Devil I got a live one! Peter Griffin. Minion Sorry, Chief.
  Seems he already sold his soul in 1976 for Bee Gees tickets. And again
  in 1981 for half a Mallomar. Devil Aw, heck! Where's a lawyer when I
  need one? Chris Griffin Don't forget this! Maybe you could hang it in
  your office. Peter Griffin Son, I'll put it someplace where everyone
  can see it. Antonio Monatti Excuse me. I'll give you $1,000 for what
  you have in the back there. Peter Griffin $1,000 for a bumper sticker?
  Antonio Monatti No, no. I mean that painting. I must have it for my
  gallery in Soho. I'll give you $5,000. What do you say? Peter Griffin I
  say... Peter Griffin ...I love you, you freakin' son of mine! I got
  $5,000 for that painting you made me! Chris Griffin But I painted that
  just for you. Peter Griffin Don't feel bad, Chris. I didn't even want
  it. Now we all get a trip to New York because Mr. Monatti thinks you
  could be a famous artist. Brian Griffin Monatti? Antonio Monatti? Lois
  Griffin You've heard of this man? Brian Griffin He's only the biggest
  art dealer in New York. I met him when I was hanging out with Andy
  Warhol in the '70s.
  [1970s art rock instrumental music] 
  Lois Griffin Peter, we are not going to New York! Peter Griffin Lois,
  our son has been blessed with a great gift. And I'm gonna do everything
  I can to nurture that talent and help him succeed. Because that's good
  parenting. Right, Bing Crosby? Bing Crosby That's right. And if your
  kids give you any lip you can beat them with a sack of Valencia
  oranges. It won't leave a bruise and they'll let 'em know who's boss.
  There's no doubt about it. Peter Griffin But that doesn't sound right.
  Bing Crosby Are you giving me lip, boy? Because I'll take this belt off
  and put the smack-down on you! Is that what you want? How's that? Peter
  Griffin Knock it off! Get away from me, you dead crooner!
  [Theme from NYPD Blue] 
  David Leisure Hi. This is David Leisure. You probably remember me as
  the neighbor from TV's Empty Nest. No? How about those car commercials
  when I played Joe Isuzu? The guy who lied? Come on! Those were popular!
  They ran all the time! All right, look, just buckle up. Can I get my
  check now? Lois Griffin Oh, kids. Look at that man over there! Grabbing
  his crotch! So alive, this city!
  [Cheery instrumental music] 
  Lois Griffin Central Park! Meg Griffin There's the Empire State
  Building! Chris Griffin There's a hot dog cart! Lois Griffin Chris,
  don't spoil your appetite. Lois Griffin New York has some of the best
  restaurants in the world. They even have Indian food here. Not the...
  kind, but the... kind. Hotel Employee Welcome to the Big Apple, fella.
  Stewie Griffin Make sure there's a Wall Street Journal next to the
  changing table. And send a masseuse up. Legitimate! Peter Griffin Hey,
  waiter. The name's Peter Griffin. My son will be the best thing to
  happen to New York since Mayor Giuliani had all the homeless people
  killed. Chris Griffin And all I gotta do is paint! Peter Griffin Hey,
  you guys have any bellhops that are rats like the Muppets? Meg Griffin
  Mom, can we go see a Broadway play tonight? Brian Griffin Count me out.
  I'll never go to the theater with Peter again. Actress "Remember when
  you were younger, Uncle Vanya used to spend whole nights translating
  books for you? Uncle Vanya and I worked without rest, afraid to spend a
  kopeck on ourselves." Peter Griffin What the hell is this? For crying
  out loud! Somebody throw a pie! Peter Griffin Screw the theater. Mr.
  Monatti invited us to a party so Chris can meet a bunch of artists.
  It's at the Museum of Modern Art. I hope that's not some kind of museum!
  [Jazz music playing in museum] 
  Brian Griffin Mapplethorpe? I thought he just did photography. Art
  Enthusiast No. Early on, he did caricatures. Robert Mapplethorpe Okay,
  Tim. Who's your favorite sports star? Boy Reggie Jackson. Robert
  Mapplethorpe I'm gonna draw him pooping on your chest. What number is
  he? Antonio Monatti Welcome. Chris, there are a number of artists here
  I would like you to meet. Peter Griffin Let's talk turkey, Monatti.
  Look, we've been here all day. Chris isn't a famous artist yet! Brian
  Griffin Creating art takes a lot of training and technique. All the
  great artists I knew took classes. Peter Griffin Even Walt Disney?
  Minnie Mouse Do I have to? Walt Disney You want to be a star, don't
  you? Then take it off! Yeah, that's nice. Peter Griffin Art school? We
  don't have time. Chris, give me your ear! Lois Griffin Peter! Antonio
  Monatti Mr. Griffin, please. I invited you so that Chris could make an
  impression on the art community. Antonio Monatti Why don't you folks do
  some sightseeing? If you leave Chris in my hands the name Griffin will
  be as well known as Kandinsky. Peter Griffin Who? Antonio Monatti
  Rembrandt? Peter Griffin Who? Antonio Monatti Da Vinci? Peter Griffin
  Who? Antonio Monatti Bazooka Joe? Peter Griffin There you go. Lois
  Griffin The United Nations. I wish Chris could see this. Isn't it
  inspiring how so many different cultures can come together? Peter
  Griffin And use up all the towels in the men's room! Lois Griffin
  Peter! Peter Griffin Sorry.
  [Hand dryer blowing] 
  Peter Griffin Man, these things never get 'em completely dry. Lois
  Griffin Where's Stewie?
  [Running footsteps] 
  Stewie Griffin Hidden missile silos behind the Great Wall! Ancient
  Chinese secret, huh? Chris Griffin Mr. Monatti, shouldn't I be painting
  now? Antonio Monatti Trust me. Painting is the least important thing
  about being a successful artist. You need an image. Let's take this
  Rhode Island lump of clay and turn it into the toast of New York. Chris
  Griffin I love toast! Antonio Monatti Cut it short and tint it green,
  the color of money. Chris Griffin And boogers. Lois Griffin I feel like
  we've been walking in circles. I don't know how you can find anything
  in this city. It's so confusing. Peter Griffin Well, I bet if Hillary
  Clinton becomes senator, she'll straighten it out even though she could
  never straighten out Bill. Lois Griffin I love when you use topical
  humor. It's just like watching Murphy Brown. Character1 Hey, Murphy,
  blah-blah-blah John Sununu. Character2 Murphy, blah-blah-blah Tipper
  Gore. Character3 Hey, Murph, you can't blah-blah-blah-blah the
  Ayatollah. Murphy Brown Blah-blah, Bishop Desmond Tutu, blah-blah.
  Chris Griffin Shouldn't my mom and dad be here by now? Antonio Monatti
  They called and said they'd rather wander through Soho Iooking for an
  address that doesn't exist. Chris Griffin That's my dad. Well, maybe
  tomorrow we could... Antonio Monatti There's Kate Moss. Chris Griffin
  Where? I don't see her. Are you The Matrix? Antonio Monatti Kate, this
  is my newest discovery, Christobel. Chris Griffin My name's Chris.
  Antonio Monatti Not anymore. Christobel will look better in Interview
  magazine. Kate Moss Nice to meet you. I love artists. Oops. A crack in
  the floor! Peter Griffin Hey, Lois, give me a penny. Lois Griffin
  You're not gonna throw it over the edge? Peter Griffin No. Yes. Antonio
  Monatti Christobel, I've just scheduled your first exhibit! Chris
  Griffin Wow! I can't wait to tell my dad. Peter Griffin Yes. I know how
  important your success is to your father. That's why he'll understand
  that you can never see him again. Chris Griffin Yeah. Of course he
  will. Dad's very... What? Antonio Monatti Christobel, the art world is
  a place of culture and breeding. Your father is... Oh, dear. How can I
  say this without upsetting you? Your dad is a pig! Chris Griffin
  [Joyful laughter] Antonio Monatti So you see? It's up to you, son.If
  you don't want to disappoint your dad, you must keep him away. Peter
  Griffin There's my boy. Hey, come on. Let's go over to Barneys and fart
  in the suits. Chris Griffin All right, Dad, I... I mean... I can't see
  you anymore. Peter Griffin What are you talking about? You're my son.
  Antonio Monatti Mr. Griffin, he's going to be a great artist. He now
  belongs to the public. Chris Griffin And apparently I'm dating Kate
  Moss. Don't say anything bad about her, because she might be here right
  now. Peter Griffin Wait a minute. You can't just push me aside. I made
  you! And I can destroy you! Goddamn. They must've put it in the wrong
  baby. Girl Bobby Williams, I'd love to go out with you. Peter Griffin I
  can't believe Chris. If I hadn't used his painting to patch that window
  he'd still be in that dump in Quahog. Lois Griffin That "dump" is our
  home. Peter Griffin Dump? So now you're too good for us, too? Lois
  Griffin This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Chris, not you!
  Are you so selfish you can't see that? Peter Griffin Yes, I am. Brian
  Griffin Peter, your son is using his talents to pursue his dream. Peter
  Griffin I have no son! Except for Stewie and Meg! Peter Griffin
  [Singing] "I had a dream Peter Griffin "It's all about you Peter
  Griffin "Meg Griffin Peter Griffin "Not much you can do Peter Griffin
  "Meg Griffin Peter Griffin "You can't dance Peter Griffin "You can't
  sing Peter Griffin "No, you pretty much can't do a thing Peter Griffin
  "Never fear, Daddy's here Peter Griffin "Honey, you're gonna make our
  name famous Peter Griffin "You'll be larger than life Peter Griffin
  "I'll be proud you fell out of my wife Peter Griffin "You'll be known,
  far and wide Peter Griffin "Like that princess who died Peter Griffin
  "I'm gonna make you famous Peter Griffin "Wait and see Peter Griffin
  "Honey, I'm gonna do this for you Peter Griffin "But it's really for
  me" Peter Griffin Fine. If Chris doesn't need me, I don't need him.
  You're gonna love being famous, Meg. And this is the town to do it in.
  Meg Griffin I don't know, Dad. What am I gonna do? Peter Griffin
  Everybody's good at something. Peter Griffin It's just a matter of
  finding that one special hidden talent. But promise me, when you make
  it big, you'll let me take advantage of all the... Meg Griffin MEG: I
  can't think of anything. I guess I don't have any talent. Peter Griffin
  Come on. Think harder. There's gotta be something you can do. Meg
  Griffin [whistling] Peter Griffin That's amazing! Brian Griffin Thanks.
  I roomed with Scott Hamilton at prep school. Nothing happened. Peter
  Griffin No. I mean that bird just came to Meg when she whistled. Meg
  Griffin No, those are just my bird calls. Peter Griffin Do it again!
  Big Bird Yeah? Well, what did you want? You called me, right? Meg
  Griffin No. I wasn't calling you. Big Bird This is funny to you? Yeah?
  You know what a pain in the ass it is to get across town this time of
  day? Peter Griffin Listen, mister, we don't want any trouble here. Big
  Bird I don't fly, you know. I take the subway like everybody else. And
  people don't stare. You make me puke, bitch. Chris Griffin Mr. Monatti,
  I don't feel like painting. I want to see my dad. Antonio Monatti
  Listen, Christobel. I've sunk $5,000 turning you into a New York
  bohemian. All you have to do is paint. Now, get busy. I have to go oil
  up and start squeezing into my leather pants. Excuse me. Chris Griffin
  Jeez, Kate, what should I do? Kate Moss I don't know. You're the flavor
  of the month. Oops. Window open. Meg Griffin [Crow cawing] Bird 1 I'm
  going over there! Bird 2 No. Bird 1 I'm gonna go over there and punch
  her! Bird 2 No. Meg Griffin This is humiliating. Peter Griffin Hey,
  it's show business, baby. You gotta start somewhere. Meg Griffin No, I
  don't. I quit! Peter Griffin Now wait just a minute, young lady. Don't
  you walk away from me! Hey! Don't you start running! Wait, Meg! Get off

Title: Fifteen Minutes of Shame

All right, we're gonna use a fan brush here. I want you to take some
  hunter green,
  and we're gonna put a happy little bush down here in the corner.
  And that'll just be our little secret.
  And if you tell anyone that that bush is there...
  I will come to your house and I will cut you.
  Aw, jeez. Mine doesn't look anything like his. Ah, the hell with it.
  It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  Ha! Boy, you throw like a fishwife. Come on, ya hairy, lubbin',
  friggin' rod.
  Chris, are you gonna take that from a fisherman?
  No way!
  Argh!
  Argh! Oh, for the love of Pete! Oh!
  - I'm good. - Oh, how fun. And it's for a good cause.
  All the money goes to the families of fishermen who've been eaten by
  sharks.
  Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Quahog, Adam West.
  Thank you. Thank you very much.
  Thank you. Thank you.
  Thank you. Mm. Thank you.
  Thank you.
  It was 360 years ago that Quahog founder Miles "Chatterbox" Musket set
  sail
  for the new colony of Rhode Island.
  You know what I'm gonna do when we get to shore? First, I'm gonna have
  a snack.
  No, no, no. Shower first, snack second.
  I hope I see Indians! Think they'll have American cheese?
  Ever the free thinker, Miles was thrown overboard for speaking his mind.
  He was as good as dead.
  But, as legend has it, he was saved by a magic clam,
  who brought him to shore and shared the vision of a new colony,
  which would be called Quahog.
  There are fields for tilling, woods for timber, and always the bounty
  of the sea.
  Look at all this sand! Do you know there are beaches with black sand?
  - Did I not pack my towel? - Are you listening? I'm trying to help.
  And help he did. Thanks to the clam's leadership,
  Quahog became a great and prosperous settlement.
  But relations between Miles and the clam soon soured.
  I know he's an Indian, but what kind of a name is Squanto?
  - Leslie or something like that would be nice. - Shut up! Just shut up!
  God! Keep it to yourself once in a while! Oh!
  Here, look what I'm doing. All right? Look, watch this.
  Huh? Look. See that, see that?
  Now try it with me. Huh? OK? OK?
  Things only got worse. Before long, Miles began to contemplate killing
  the clam.
  I was awake last night, Miles.
  I saw you.
  I think it's time for me to go.
  I'll send for my things.
  Wait! Don't go! I'm sorry!
  Miles never spoke again. But every year until his death -
  from a combination of tuberculosis and a tomahawk to the head -
  he went to the shore on this day in hopes that the magic clam would
  return.
  Today we citizens of Quahog continue this tradition.
  What's that? Something out at sea?
  Clam ho-o-o-o!
  They're giving your cue, Peter.
  Whose idea was it to make the suit out of foam rubber?
  It's such an honour to play the magic clam. Aren't you proud of your
  dad, kids?
  Are you kidding? God, this is worse than having Ronald McDonald for a
  father.
  - Bye, Dad! Don't wait up! - Whoa!
  Come back here. You're not going out with all that make-up on.
  - But, Dad... - Upstairs!
  You're a McDonald, not a whore.
  I think I got a wave here!
  Huh. So that's what Peter's penis looks like.
  How could you embarrass me?! Nobody better pull this crap at my slumber
  party.
  Don't worry. You and your friends are gonna have a great time.
  Yes, yes, how delightful it will be.
  A pubescent herd of gabby wretches prattling on about boys and music
  and jellybeans and stickers...
  Oh, we'd better stop by the hospital so I can get my cooties shot.
  Shut up.
  Just leave me and my friends alone tonight.
  Meg, will you relax? None of us are gonna do anything to embarrass you.
  Jeez, I gotta get gas.
  Hey, any of you guys want a soda? I'm gonna go inside and get a soda.
  Mom!
  Meg, you know your father loves you very much.
  - Mr Griffin? - Oh, my God.
  Hey, Meg, it's Kevin from next door. I didn't know you worked here.
  Hey, Kevin, come here. Come here! Say hi to Meg.
  She's right in there, right there.
  OK, I'd put Brad Pitt's face on Brendan Fraser's body
  with Ben Affleck's butt.
  My turn, my turn.
  I'd take James Brolin's face, Mark Spitz's body,
  and Milton Berle's legendary genitals. Ah!
  - Mom, what are you doing? - I love slumber parties.
  OK, truth or dare. Who here has gone all the way? Hm?
  At my sleepovers, we used to practise French kissing. Now, everybody
  pair up.
  - All right, Mom! - Chris, get outta here right now!
  - Um... I can't. - OK, finish up and then come out.
  Lois, have you seen my fake beard?
  Oh, crap! I'm stuck in the stairs.
  Oh, God, kill me now.
  Hello.
  Karen!
  All right, Meg, I need you to boil some water. Girls, I'm gonna need
  towels. Lots of 'em.
  - OK, let's go. - Oh, jeez. I'm sorry, Meg's friends.
  Look, I'll make it up to you. I'll get you Davy Jones for your school
  dance.
  - Ow! Ah, jeez! Lois, what is that? Acid? - You guys are ruining my
  life!
  I'm sorry, honey. I know how you must feel.
  If you care about me, you won't show your faces for the rest of the
  night.
  Well, then it's a good thing I have this.
  I am not a crook.
  Look, I mean it. All of you. Oh, God, where's Stewie?
  Well, Beth, what do you think? Does Mark find you attractive?
  - I don't know. - Well, have you asked him?
  Not exactly.
  All right, let's try some role-playing. I'll be Mark.
  You ask me out to the box social or whatever the devil it is you
  children do these days.
  Peter, don't!
  God, your hand is like ice! Just here. Give it to me.
  Ooh, that'll warm it up a little.
  Oh, that's nice.
  Oh! Oh! Oh!
  - Peter, wait till... - Sha... shaargh!
  Oh, Peter.
  - Argh! - Argh!
  - What happened to your friends? - My family scared them away.
  I wish there was some way I could make them understand how embarrassing
  they are.
  Welcome back to "Diane!"
  Erica, it's time for Mario's little confession.
  Erica, you know I love you, but I gotta come clean.
  I'm... I'm not really a man.
  I'm a woman.
  Oh, my God. You're a woman?
  Well, actually, I'm not really a woman.
  I'm a horse.
  Oh, my God. You're a horse?
  Actually, I'm not really a horse.
  I'm a broom.
  OK, OK. So, how do you feel?
  To be honest with you, Diane, I'm surprised.
  Man, this is a great show. They drag these idiots up on stage and then
  blindside 'em.
  Like this one guy, didn't know he was actually two midgets.
  Oh, those poor, unsuspecting people.
  Well, maybe some of them deserved it.
  Hello, and welcome to Diane!
  Today's guest is tired of being embarrassed by her family.
  - Meg, how did you get these tickets again? - Let's bring them up right
  now.
  Whatever problems we have can be settled in the privacy of...
  - The Griffin family. - Suckers.
  Uh-oh.
  And we're back. Griffins, do you have anything to say to your daughter?
  I can't believe you'd do this to us, Meg. Maybe now I won't give you
  the antidote.
  - To what? - To the poison you just drank!
  See what I mean? This is not normal.
  You there, Bingo. It seems the naughty baby has made a messy-poo in
  his...
  I say, what's this? Volume. Volume!
  Look, what's the big deal? I mean, we're just a regular American family.
  We have family dinners, and we go to church...
  Yeah, and you even manage to humiliate me there.
  - Whoa! Is that really the blood of Christ? - Yes.
  Man! That guy must've been wasted 24 hours a day, huh?
  We have a caller on the line. Go ahead.
  Yes. Yes. I say, do you have Prince Albert in a can?
  Quiet, quiet, quiet. Shut up. Shut up.
  Well, you'd better let him out!
  That's hilarious!
  Meg, you have two parents who love you and...
  What does that say under me? Oh, go yourself, Diane.
  She said a swear!
  Peter, do you think there might be any validity to what Meg is feeling?
  Who are you callin' Uncle Tom?!
  - What? - OK, time out.
  This kind of acrimony isn't gonna resolve our differences.
  Just shut up and throw a chair.
  - OK. - Argh!
  Hm.
  Uh-oh. Fire! Fire!
  City Hall is burning! Don't worry. I'll put it out.
  Hey, great show out there.
  If you want an autograph, you either gotta give me a pen or get me some
  snow.
  I look at you and I see a series. We would like to put cameras in your
  house
  and follow the drama that is your family. Kinda like The Real World.
  All right! Then everyone'd get to see me and my wacky antics.
  Bleh!
  - So, do we have a deal? - Let's shake on it.
  Mom, are we on TV right now?
  Yes, Chris. Your father signed a contract,
  and now we're gonna be on TV for the next six months.
  How could you do this? You turned my life into the 24-hour Loser
  Channel.
  You! Cameraman! Make sure you use that Cybill Shepherd filter.
  If it makes her look half-human, it'll take six months off my face.
  Um...
  I... I find the toothpaste with a pump is a little easier to get on the
  brush.
  Um... you might have noticed my underwear has a hole in it.
  It's... you know... I don't see any reason to throw it out.
  The waist is still fine, you know... You can see it's still real
  stretchy.
  Mom, you have to do something!
  Dad's on TV parading around in his underwear like some gross European
  guy!
  Oh, now, sweetie, your father is just a free spirit.
  Here. A good breakfast is the foundation of a good day.
  And a bad breakfast is the foundation of indigestion. Hey-oh!
  Hi. I'm Brian.
  What the hell is this? I said egg whites only!
  Are you trying to give me a bloody heart attack? Make it again!
  Ah, the breakfast thing.
  Yes. It wasn't even about the eggs, really.
  Frankly, I like the yolks. I don't... I have no problem.
  It's just there's always been a lot of tension between Lois and me,
  and it's not so much that I want to kill her,
  it's just I want her not to be alive any more.
  I sometimes wonder if all women are this difficult, and then I think to
  myself
"My God! Wouldn't it be marvellous if I turned out to be a homosexual?"
One time my dad pooped in the neighbours' yard, then lied about it.
I knew it! Well, I'm glad I used his shovel to clean it up.
Wow! Joe, this sort of makes you like Larry from Three's Company.
You know, I always thought he was sexy.
Yes! I am all about Larry over here!
Um, on Sundays we generally catch the early-bird special
here at the Lobster Shanty.
There's fresh seafood, good prices.
- Plus... it's a shanty. - And you get to pick your own lobster.
Yes. That one looks like he's got some fight in him.
Take off the rubber bands! I'm going in.
Oh, my God, it is them! I can't believe the Griffins eat here like
  everyday people.
  We're, like, trying to eat here.
  - Meg, put your bib on. - I don't wanna wear a bib.
  Meg, honey, it's very cold in here. Maybe you'd be more comfortable
  with your bib on.
  - She means your nipples are stickin' out. - Mom!
  Nipples! Nipples!
  That's it! I want those cameras off!
  Fourth wall! You're breaking the fourth wall!
  Meg, you're the one that got us on TV in the first place.
  Well, now I am getting us off TV. I quit.
  Hm. This isn't necessarily a bad thing.
  We can't do the show without Meg.
  Why not? Our research shows that Meg is the least popular character on
  the show.
  But everyone loves the rest of you. Lois, women 25 to 49 see you as a
  role model.
  - Really? - Absolutely.
  - What about me? - You?!
  Look, the bottom line is you folks are still under contract, OK?
  But I've come up with a solution I think will make everyone happy.
  - Jason Gallagher. - Present.
  Meg Griffin.
  - Oh, sorry I'm late, Mr... - Here.
  - Hello? - Over here.
  - Thank you for meeting us here. Cigarette? - Peter.
  - Sorry. We have to keep this brief. - Why are we here?
  No cameras. The TV executives don't want viewers to be confused and
  think you're Meg.
  - You're gonna let them recast me? - Could've been worse.
  They could've gone with plan B.
  - Brian, put a mask on. - I have an announcement.
"Meg Griffin's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan."
"It spun in. There were no survivors."
Who do I see about a Section Eight?
Fine! Do your stupid show without me.
I'll be at Cleveland's house. I don't wanna be a part of this family
  any more.
  - Meg! - She'll be OK.
  We gotta go. The cameramen think we're taking Chris to soccer practice.
  We're gonna be late! Why won't you talk to me?!
  Oh, Meg, honey, our home is your home for as long as you like.
  We could offer you the guest room,
  provided that it doesn't bother you that my Great Uncle Chet died in
  there.
  Oh. I guess not.
  Uh, when did he die?
  We think sometime between The Tonight Show and The Today Show.
  You know, some people think that dandelions are weeds,
  but, uh, you know, I always think...
  who the hell decided tulips were so great?
  Hey. Hey, I'm over here. Hey!
  - Hi, Chris. - You know my name?
  Of course I do, silly. I'm your sister, Meg.
  Oh.
  Uh, I don't know if Mom and Dad told you,
  but we usually have breakfast naked and I'm allowed to videotape it.
  Ooh, my skin's getting so slippery. Hope I don't pop out of my top.
  Ohh.
  Hey, camera guy, check this out. "Peter Griffin and Madame."
  Oh, Madame, you're a lusty old girl, aren't you?
  You're the one with your hand up my backside.
  Oh! She got me.
  Hey! Hey, come back here! She's gonna sing "Rainbow Connection"!
  Mr Quagmire, can I use your toothpaste?
  Oh, my God! Excuse me.
  No problem, Meg. You probably bought me another three minutes.
  Giggedy-giggedy!
  The funniest thing happened at work today.
  - There was... - Hi.
  - Hey! - I had the worst day.
  I didn't make cheerleader because I'm so plain,
  and I still don't have a date for Friday night, as usual.
  I'm going to write in my journal about how I'll never grow big, full
  breasts like these.
  It's not fair. If I don't get any airtime, how am I ever gonna get my
  own spin-off
  where I'm a retired baseball umpire who opens a bar?
  At the centre of the earth!
  We don't get many of you molten-rock men in here.
  Well, at these prices I'm not surprised.
  That's it, pal, you... are... outta here!
  To hell with the cameras. How could we ever let them replace our little
  girl?
  I miss her, Peter.
  Me too. She's like that dorky Baldwin brother who isn't as good-Iooking
  or successful
  and never answers my letters, but he's still a Baldwin, dammit, and so
  is Meg.
  Let's go get her back!
  - What can I do for you? - I'll tell you what you can do.
  Fire that sexy, interesting version of our daughter and make us a
  family again,
  or we walk.
  Fire her? She's the highest-testing character on the show!
  - Besides, you can't quit. You have a contract. - Oh, yeah?
  Well, here's what I think of your contract.
  I think it's awful and I don't much care for it at all, my good sir.
  Lois, we're outta here.
  Well, you put me in a very awkward position, Peter, but I guess I have
  no choice.
  Mom? Dad?
  I'm home!
  - Who are you? - We're the Griffins.
  No, you're not. You're Tom Arnold.
  And you're Fran Drescher. And you're, um, that fat guy from Boogie
  Nights.
  And you're... the Olsen twins?
  Blast! Damn you all. Victory is mine.
  Whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here?
  Oh, Peter, you promised me you wouldn't drink at the stag party.
  Ugh! I do not sound like that.
  This is terrible! We're the laughing stock of the town and we've lost
  our daughter.
  - Meg! - Oh, Mom!
  Look, I don't care if you guys embarrass me. I wanna come home.
  Oh, sweetie, it's good to have you back.
  Hey, honey, I'm sorry we missed your ball game.
  What?
  Here's an ice cream. We love you, Meg.
  I love you too.
  Hey, Lois, there's a Bible in here.
  Hey, look at me! I'm a Christian! I'm reading the Bible!

Title: Road to Rhode Island

Excedrin headache number one: puppy mill.
  Damn!
  Does anyone here have thumbs? Anyone? No?
  Agh! Sorry, I don't play.
  Hey, come on! Knock it off!
  Hey, how's the flow today?
  Hey, hey! Whoa!
  Mom! Do something. Mom! Help!
  Mom!
  And that was the last time I ever saw her.
  Brian, I think we've stumbled on the root of your problems.
  You have abandonment issues. Confront your mother and deal with this.
  Are you crazy? My eyes were barely open and she just gave me away.
  Well, it's her loss, right?
  I turned out great, huh? Am I right?
  Right? Yeah! You bet your ass I'm right.
  You wanna arm wrestle? Come on, right now!
  Brian, have you been drinking?
  No.
  Brian, you really seem to be enjoying your wine lately.
  It's only my second glass.
  Dad, if bad men broke into the house,
  and they had guns, and they put a gun up to your head
  and made you choose who you wanted to live, me or Meg, who would you
  choose?
  Ask your mom. I'm not very good with tough decisions.
  We'll be closing in two minutes.
  I could never choose. I love all my children equally.
  It's hard enough having Stewie all the way in Palm Springs visiting
  Grammy and Grandpa.
  Give Nana a big hug, sweetheart.
  That should guarantee some after-dinner entertainment.
  Lois, uh... I was thinking. Why don't I fly out to Palm Springs and
  pick up Stewie?
  - Really? - Yeah. It's just what I need to clear my head.
  That would be wonderful. It'll give me time to catch up on my reading.
  Usually there are so many distractions.
  Come into my home, will ya?
  I'll show you, you bastard.
  Stewie, gather your things. Time to go.
  It's about bloody time! You...
  That idiot slattern sent the dog?
  Oh, oh, oh! This is... this is...
  Oh, don't even get me started. I... I... I... I mean, really!
  When I think of... of... of... of the times that that woman has...
  Oh, I won't even begin to... to... to...
  - Can we go? - Fine.
  Peter, guess what I just got. A relationship video.
  The infomercial said this tape will help us communicate better as a
  couple.
  Lois, when have we ever had trouble communicating?
  - Oh, Peter. I love you. - About a quarter past five.
  OK, Lois. I'll make you a deal. We'll watch the tape, but you gotta do
  something for me.
  - OK. What? - Do that Katharine Hepburn impression.
  And Philadelphia Story Hepburn. None of that head-on-a-slinky
  Golden Pond stuff.
  Wait here at the gate. I gotta run a quick errand.
  - Aren't you too young to be travelling alone? - Aren't you too old to
  be wearing braces?
  - I think you've had about enough. - Well, I... I think you're wrong,
  you increasingly attractive-Looking woman.
  - You know, you're really pretty. - Oh, stop.
  No, I'm serious. You could... you could be in magazines. You could!
  And not just like Jugs or Creamsicle. 
  Call me!
  She won't call.
  Here's a pleasant sight. Cirrhosis the Wonder Dog.
  I'm... I'm not drunk. I just have a speech impediment.
  And a stomach virus.
  And an inner-ear infection.
  Flight 85 to Providence. Final boarding.
  Oh, at last!
  Yes, yes. Come now. Chase the stick.
  - Where are the bags? - What do you mean, they're right here...
  Rupert! I told you to watch the bags!
  You were watching the boys again. It's that steward, the one who looks
  like Tab Hunter.
  Forget it! Let's just get on the bloody plane and go home.
  - Our tickets were in the bags. - Flight 85 to Providence is
  now departing. 
  That's not going to stop me. 
  Hey!
  That was my plan. Where's yours?
  Oh, my God! All right, let's not dilly-dally.
  Call Lois, have her wire us some money and let's get out of here.
  I... I got... I'm s...
  I'm feeling... Oh!
  Oh, that's pretty.
  Hello? Operator? Hello?
  Oh, that's right. You have to punch in the numbers nowadays.
  I should know this.
  Oh, yes. 8675309, that's it.
  No, wait. That's not it. Damn you, Tommy Two-Tone.
  Only one thing to do.
  Lois? Damn.
  1111112.
  Lois? Damn.
  1111113.
"A way with words in marriage
for couples who communicate not good."
Oh, come on, Lois. This is gonna be worse
than when we had to watch your Uncle's Jerry's snuff film.
Are they really gonna kill that girl?
Peter, please! People are trying to watch.
Just give it a chance.
Hello. I'm Doctor Amanda Rebecca. 
By purchasing this video, you've taken the first step
towards strengthening your relationship. 
I'd like to start by asking the women to leave the room, 
because this part of the tape is for men only. We'll see you
  in a little while. 
  I can see this is gonna be very intense.
  Have fun!
  Make sure your wife is out of the room. 
  So, you wanna talk or you want me to take my top off? 
  That's what I thought. Oh, man! 
  You're making me so hot. 
  I hope you like big breasts
  because mine are so big, this itty bra can barely contain
  them. 
  - Do you wanna see more? - Yes, please.
  Then you'll have to order my next tape. 
  - You got the stuff? - I got it. Where's the money?
  - I wanna see the money. - You don't see the money till I see
  the stuff. 
  There's only one way to put an end to this nuisance.
  - He's wearing a wire! - What? You son of a...
  That's it, Mr Giraffe, get all the marmalade...
  Hello! Agh! Agh!
  Damn it to pus-spewing blood-gutted hell!
  What?
  What do you mean, our credit card was declined?
  No, no. There's no need to come up. We'II...
  Oh, blast!
  Dammit!
  Oh, come on, you. Get up. Come on! Go for a ride in the car.
  Blast! Ooh, a penny.
  - Wake up. - What? Ah!
  Oh, my head. Oh, God. What are we doing here?
  We needed a weekend away from the kids.
  - We have to get the hell out of here! - Motel manager.
  Open up, or I'll hit you with this blunt instrument
  I use to hit deadbeats with bad credit cards.
  Well, it's not an instrument. It's more of an object.
  But it's blunt. Hard and blunt.
  And, well, it's kinda like a bat. I found it out back one day when I
  was raking.
  Let's go.
  All right, we need some wheels.
  - This one's unlocked. - An SUV?
  We're trying to elude someone, not drive to soccer practice. Let's take
  this one.
  - You like that colour? - What's wrong with it?
  - I dunno. It's so dark. - Yes, but it doesn't show dirt.
  - What? - It doesn't show dirt.
  I guess.
  This is the first place we've gone to. We should try another lot.
  Sold.
  - Go on, hot-wire it. - Hot-wire? I don't even pump my own gas.
  - Oh, for God's sake. - Hurry up.
  - You did it. - Put it back. I like that song.
  If Montgomery Clift, who was in From Here to Eternity with
  Burt Lancaster,
  who was in Atlantic City with Susan Sarandon,
  who was in White Palace with Kevin Bacon. There.
  Nice, nice. Except that was James Spader in White Palace. 
  - Moron. - Ooh, Mr Snippy.
  - I just need some time to think, all right. - Yes, you've got lots to
  think about.
  - Public drunkenness, grand theft auto. - You left out the part where
  - You smash your head on the windshield. - I don't recall...
  Yes. Well. I suppose I walked right into that one.
  Hello.
  - Lois. Hi, it's Brian. - Let me talk to her.
  Brian! We were just on our way to the airport. Is everything OK?
  Yeah. Everything's fine.
  Stewie and I traded in our plane tickets for train tickets.
  Yeah. Apparently you can do that.
  - Give me the damn phone! - Little fella's asleep,
  - But I'll give him that kiss. - You suck!
  See you in three days.
  Let's go.
  Oh, crap. We gotta disappear, and quick.
  Maybe we shoulda jumped on that truck.
  - Stewie and Brian are taking a train home. - Can we not discuss
  curtains for a second?
  I got another relationship tape.
  $49.95? That's three times as much as the first one.
  Lois, our relationship cannot be measured in nipples and dimes.
  I mean nickels and boobs.
  Money. I'll be upstairs.
  - Peter, why are you so... - Get out! This is a part just for the men.
  - I say, there's a plane. - If there's a plane, there's probably a
  pilot.
  And if there's a pilot, there must be a bar. I can get a drink.
  I don't trust you. You put your seed in my daughter's belly. You're
  fired.
  But, Pa, you can't fire me.
  You're lucky you're my brother too, or I'd kill you.
  Excuse me, sir. I'm an experienced crop-dusting pilot.
  You can trust us completely. My friend is too young to put a seed in
  your daughter's belly
  - And I'm of a different species. - You're hired.
  Boy, will your face be red when they find the black box on this one.
  So saturate the soil twice a day. That's why my tomatoes haven't been
  coming in.
  Ah, let's see.
  Nosotros queremos ir con ustedes. 
  That was pretty good. But when you said "Me llamo es Brian",
  you don't need the "es". 
  - Just "Me llamo Brian". - Oh, you speak English.
  - No, just that first speech and this one. - You're kidding, right?
  - Why did we get off here? - My mother lives in Austin.
  Fate's brought me back here for a reason.
  I have to find my mother and make peace with her.
  Oh, so she's in Austin, hm?
  - Eight miles that way? - Yes.
  All right. So instead of driving down this sun-parched highway, we've
  now got to walk.
  - Uh... pretty much, yeah. - You know what this means.
  Yeah.
  I say, walk slower, dog. My Huggies are already holed up in Box Canyon.
  - Hello, Luke. - Uh, have we met?
  - My name's Brian. I was born here. - Sorry, son. Lots of dogs been
  born here.
  Refresh my memory. Which one were you again?
  - I was the one who could talk. - Brian! Come on in!
  - Betty, look who it is. - Is that Brian?
  Oh, and you brought a little friend!
  Well, I bet you're a hungry little fella.
  Yes, and I bet you lost your virginity to a mechanical bull. Now change
  me!
  Look, I've been thinking a lot about my mother lately, and...
  She was a good dog.
  - "Was"? You mean... - Last year. She went real peaceful.
  Well, she probably wouldn't have wanted to see me anyway.
  That's not true. Biscuit loved all her puppies.
  Biscuit
  Brian, your momma gave you up because she thought
  you'd have a better life if she let you go.
  Was she right, son? Do you have a good life?
  Yeah. I really do. I have a great life.
  - Would you like to see her? - "See her"? I don't understand.
  We loved Biscuit so much, we wanted to keep her with us always.
  So we had her stuffed!
  Mom!
  I say, someone must have said a funny, because your mother's
  in stitches!
  I'll leave you to grieve.
  Come on, Betty, why don't we get these fellas some sandwiches?
  Look at Jesus standing over there all by himself.
  You'd think those bulldogs would invite him to their card game.
  You deserve better than this, Mom.
  This is actually a rather elegant solution for my problem of what to do
  with Lois.
  Shut up and help me. I'm not leaving her here.
  Oh, relax. Old girl doesn't have too much to wag about these days,
  anyway.
  Hey, Meg. Try to guess the word I'm thinking of right now.
  And it's not "kitty".
  - "Car". - No.
  - I dunno. "Apple". - No. Give up?
  - Yeah. - It was "kitty"!
  - Peter... - Oh, my God! The new video! Life is sweet!
  How about some whipped cream? 
  Oh, that's always good.
  - And some cinnamon. - Oh! That's good too.
  And then guess what? I'm going to add... 
  Oh, jeez, if she says "Mrs Dash", I'm gonna lose it.
  We're going to add... 
  - Peter! - Agh!
  I know what you've been doing, and I'm very upset with you. 
  Wow. Usually beautiful women don't turn back into you until after I'm
  finished.
  These tapes are about communication. If you wanted to see a
  woman acting nasty... 
  you shoulda told me. 
  - This is hot. - Turn around. 
  Lois! Ah, this is not what it looks like. She means nothing to me.
  - Peter, it's OK. - Yeah?
  I was trying to be sexy for ya.
  Ahh! Come here, you!
  You shoulda told me... 
  You shoulda told me... 
  I'm gonna get directions to the nearest park so we can give my mother a
  proper burial.
  Come on, darling. Stiff upper lip
  I'm writing that one down.
  - Say something. - What?
  - Just say something, please! - Oh, for God's sake.
  Um... Uh...
  Yea, and God said to Abraham you will kill your son Isaac.
  And Abraham said "I can't hear you."
"You'll have to speak into the microphone."
And God said "Oh, I'm sorry. Is this better?"
"Jerry, pull the high end out. I'm still getting some hiss back."
- Say something about my mother! - Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
I never knew Biscuit as a dog,
but I did know her as a table.
She was sturdy, all four legs the same length...
Thanks. That's enough.
Yes, yes. Requiem and terra pax, and so forth. Amen.
Wow, look at all those stars.
I've read that starlight gives you cancer. Then again, what doesn't
  these days?
  Listen, there's something I've been meaning to tell you. It's not easy
  for me to say.
  Oh, God. You're not coming out of the closet, are you?
  Why does everyone always come out to me? 
  I just wanted to thank you for everything you did today.
  - I know this whole trip has been a mess. - Well, it hasn't been all
  bad.
  I must admit there have been some moments that were, dare I say, fun.
  We're off on the road to Rhode Island
  We're having the time of our lives
  - Take it, dog! - We're quite a pair of partners
  Just like Thelma and Louise
  'Cept you're not six feet tall
  - And your breasts don't reach your knees. - Give it time.
  We're off on the road to Rhode Island
  We're certainly going in style
  I'm with an intellectual
  - Who craps inside his pants - How dare you?
  At least I don't leave urine stains on all the household plants
  Oh, pee jokes.
  We've travelled a bit and we've found
  Like a masochist in Newport, we're Rhode-Island bound
  - Crazy travel conditions. - First class and no class.
  Careful with that joke-it's an antique.
  We're off on the road to Rhode Island
  We're not gonna stop till we're there
  Maybe for a beer.
  Whatever dangers we may face
  - We'll never fear or cry - That's right!
  Until we're syndicated, Fox will never let us die
  - Please? - We're off on the road to Rhode Island
  The home of that old campus swing
  We may pick up some college girls
  And picnic on the grass
  We'd tell you more but we would have the censors on our ass
  We certainly do get around
  Like renegade Pilgrims thrown out of Plymouth Colony.
  We're Rhode Island-bound
  Like two college freshmen who were rejected by Harvard and forced to go
  to Brown.
  We're Rhode Island-bound
  Look who I found at the train station!
  My baby! Mommy missed you so much.
  God forbid you should have put a little eyeliner on for my homecoming.
  Did you have a nice trip with Brian?
  Yes, smooth sailing through calm seas.
  Hey, kid! Thanks for not ratting me out. Is there anything I can do to
  pay you back?
  Oh, yes. You remember that episode of The Brady Bunch where
  Bobby saved Greg's life,
  - And Greg became his slave? - Yep.
  It's on this afternoon. You can tape it for me. And put a nice label on
  it.
  OK, Meg. I'm thinking of another word.
  This time it's definitely not "kitty".
  - Can you guess what it is? - Is it "kitty"?
  Uh! Get out of my head!
  Get out of my head!



Title: Let's Go to the Hop

It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  Cuando la jefe oye de esto somos muertos!
  Recuerda si yo cierra la puerta de la garaje esta manana?
  Dude, the Bronze Age was so much cooler than the Iron Age.
  The Iron Age could kick the Bronze Age's butt any day of the week.
  - Could not! - Could too!
  Ew, gross, man!
  - You OK? - Whoa! Everything's so... significant.
  - Dude, you gotta try this. - Not even! It's got your germs on it.
  Not this end.
  Ahh! I can see the air! And you know what else?
  I finally get Aaron Sorkin's Sports Night. It's a comedy that's too
  good to be funny.
  Dude, you're trippin'!
  Double the freshness, life is more fun
  When you're chewing the great taste of Doublefresh gum
  La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
  With Doublefresh gum!
  Hey, we should go to the circus.
  In local news, a new drug craze may have Quahog students licked. It's
  called "toad".
  The Colombian spotted toad, to be precise.
  When licked, these toads trigger an intense psychedelic euphoria
  that's... that's just great.
  This is awful. Now the drugs are in the schools?
  For you parents, toad-licking is also known as lily-padding,
  Frenching the prince, and doing Kermit.
  Well, at least our kids know better.
  What the...? Aargh!
  Hello, little sea monkeys.
  He's back. Don't look at him, honey. Eat your potatoes.
  - Steve, do something. - Brenda, we've been over this.
  Let's just pick up our plates and go eat in the hollow castle.
  - Young man, where did you get this toad? - It's not mine.
  Believe me, you don't wanna mess with drugs. I tried 'em once-big
  mistake.
  Things got way too real.
  Holy crap, I am freakin' out!
  Peter, may I? You're walking down a hallway. You take a left. You keep
  walking.
  - Take a right. Then a left. Brick wall! - Yargh!
  - Yeah, he's tweaked. - Am not! Hey, maybe it's Meg's toad.
  Oh, now, don't you try to palm this off on your sister. She's a good
  girl.
  Oh, yeah? What about the time she strangled our other sister?
  Now, Chris, we told you that was just a very bad dream.
  - But I remember it so... - It was a dream!
  - Mom, can you sign this for my field trip? - Sure, sweetheart.
  Meg, you have a wart!
  How could you bring a toad into this house?
  It's not mine. I was just holding it for a friend.
  See... it was lunchtime.
  OK, Connie, you're up.
  Connie Demico does toad?
  I guess Miss Wears-A-Hat-All-The-Time is gonna nark on us, aren't you?
  - Mr Berler's coming! - Oh, man, we are so busted!
  Put it in here. He won't check me.
  What's going on back here? Oh, hello, Megan. Wait, you're not part of
  the popular clique.
  Run along and play alone somewhere. Shame on you all, getting her hopes
  up like that.
  I thought if I held Connie's toad,
  she'd make one of the cool guys ask me to the Snow Ball.
  You're holding drugs so someone will invite you to a dance?
  Meg, haven't we taught you better than that?
  Hold on, Lois. People do a lot of crazy things just to be accepted.
  I don't know about this.
  We all did it. If you want to be a Supreme Court justice,
  you gotta pick up that cherry with your butt cheeks and drop it in that
  beer.
  - Come on! Come on! - Go, Suitor! Get busy!
  - Go, Suitor! Go, Suitor! - Cherry! Cherry! Cherry!
  Oh, my God! I can't believe he did that!
  - Go, Suitor! Go, Suitor! - Get busy! Get busy!
  Ohhh!
  I can't believe he did that!
  I can't believe he did that! This guy is so in!
  Oh, sweetheart, I'm sure all the boys wanna ask you to the dance.
  They're probably just shy or scared.
  Yeah, I was terrified of askin' Phoebe Diamond to the prom.
  I finally got up the guts, but I had this damn nervous twitch.
  - Um, Ph-Ph-Phoebe? - Yeah?
  Uh, I was wonderin' if... if... if you'd, uh, d-do me the honour of,
  uh...
  I had such a crush on her. Until I met you, Lois.
  You're my silver medal.
  Mr Toad, how many licks of you does it take
  to get to the centre of a Rhode Island state prison?
  Just one.
  How could this happen? I thought we lived in such a nice small town.
  There's no such thing. Things are different than when we were kids.
  - Well, it just makes me sad. - It makes me sad too, but, uh, you know.
  I mean, if Meg's at risk, then so is Chris, and Stewie'll be in
  preschool before we know it.
  Well, we just have to trust our kids to stay off drugs.
  I do trust our kids. It's the other kids I don't trust.
  Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, I guess it's up to us as parents to be a
  part of the solution.
  - I'll go talk to the principal tomorrow. - Thanks, honey.
  - The safety word is banana. - I love you.
  And that's my plan, Principal Shepherd. So, are you with me?
  But... you didn't tell me anything. You just sat down and said "And
  that's my plan."
  Oh. Oh, right. OK, here's my idea.
  - And that's my plan, Principal Shepherd. - Well, Mr Griffin, I don't
  like it.
  I love it! You have the faculty's full support. But how will you pull
  it off?
  You let me worry about that, kitten.
  Great.
  Hey, Meg. What's got four arms, four legs and one set of lips?
  You and me at the Winter Snow Ball. Heh-heh!
  Look, Neil, I don't... Oh, my God!
  Dad? Dad?!
  I'm not responding because I'm not this "Dad" person.
  I'm the new kid in town, Lando Griffin.
  Are you crazy? What are you doing here?
  I've gone undercover to get rid of the toad problem,
  so your school can be safe and innocent like the good old days.
  Negative B plus or minus radical B squared minus 4AC over 2A.
  That's correct. A girl answered a math problem. You know what that
  means.
  A witch!
  - Witch! She's a witch! - Witch!
  Witch!
  God, please tell me I have a brain tumour and this is all just a side
  effect from the chemo.
  - Hey, what are you doin' in my locker? - Your locker?
  Say, Phil, what do you say to happy hour after work?
  I'd say Cheryl's gonna have another black eye to explain to the
  neighbours.
  - Come on, I'm buyin'. - Oh, yeah.
  - Hey, man, cool specs. - Thanks, G.
  I'm the new kid in town, Lando Griffin.
  No relation. So, tell me, homeboy, how 'bout the baggy clothes we kids
  are wearin'?
  Aren't they phat and stupid and poppin' fresh?
  Hey, does anybody have any drugs? I'm lookin' to score some drugs.
  - Dad, get away from me. Connie is looking. - So that's toad girl, huh?
  Yeah. And that's Connie.
  I see. Well, I'm gonna have a little talk with that Connie.
  Huh! Good luck. She only talks to the cool kids.
  - Oh, yeah? Watch this. - No!
  Heeey!
  Agh! Agh! Ow! Oh, God! Agh! Ow! Ow!
  - Cool! He's bleeding! - Just like in the movies!
  Hm.
  Holy crap, it's The Breakfast Club.
  You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Tiger
  house.
  I got a carton of cigarettes. Old man grabbed me, said "Hey, smoke up,
  Tony."
"They're grrreat!" Bastard.
Hey, Lando.
Everyone's talking about how you trashed the jukebox. Classic cool.
- We're gonna do some toad. You in? - You're gonna do toad?!
- What's the big deal? - Lemme tell you about it, stud.
You'll get chills
All through your body
And you'll lose all control
Of your bladder
And your sphincter
That's your butt hole!
Cos if you use toad
Then I'm tellin' you
You can kiss your life goodbye
Yeah, when you use toad
It'll mess you up
It'll make your mama cry That's no lie
You'll choke on your tongue and die
Gotta give it up
Give up the toad now
It's no joke
Buddy, give it up
Gotta give up the toad now
Or you'll croak
Buddy, give it up
You gotta give up the toad now
And don't smoke
Or you'll see
It hurts to pee
There'll be blood
Gushin' from ya
Every time that you cough
And forget gettin' lucky
It falls off
Yeah, you'd better wise up
Cos I'm tellin' you
Toad is what Lando forbids
Gotta give it all up
Or you're gonna see
Your whole life will hit the skids
And your kids will be born without eyelids
Gotta give it up
Give up the toad now
Thanks to you, Lando
Give it up
Give up the toad now
Thanks to you, Lando
Give it up Gotta give up the toad now
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm no fool
Lando's cool
Yeah!
- You're the coolest, Lando. - Yeah.
We never broke into song and dance before you arrived.
I'll never touch another toad. None of us will.
- Yeah. - No way, man.
- I know I won't. - You never did it in the first place.
- God! You're such a wannabe loser. - Oh, yeah? If I'm such a loser,
how come I'm going to the Snow Ball with Lando?
Meg, you got a date?! Oh, wait till I tell your mother!
Who I'm looking forward to meeting.
And I hope is making Steak Ums tonight.
- Hey, Meg, wanna ditch and go to the mall? - Sure! See ya, Lando.
This is great. Not only did I live long enough to see Meg go to her
  first dance,
  but I'm takin' her too. Thanks, Geritol.
  And they swore they'd never do toad again.
  Dad never came to sing at my school. I don't want dessert!
  I tell you, Lois, high school's a lot more fun this time around.
  And it's a lot safer now that all the kids have guns. And today in
  study hall,
  I farted real loud on purpose to make the guys laugh,
  and I swear to God it was so heinous Susie Johnson ralphed up her
  Salisbury steak.
  I'm sorry, is this really proper dinner conversation?
  I'm glad you taught those kids they don't have to do drugs to be
  popular.
  He sure did! Who needs drugs when you go to the dance with the coolest
  guy in school?
  Going with Dad is gonna skyrocket me up the popularity food chain.
  It's true. Soon members of the math club will be attaching themselves
  to your underbelly.
  Wait a minute. Peter, you can't take Meg to a school dance.
  How long do you think you can keep up this charade?
  Just till Friday! Please, Mom?
  Well, if this is what you want.
  Oh, it's probably Connie calling for me.
  Hello?
  Oh. Yeah, hold on. It's for Lando.
  Aloha!
  No way!
  Uh... uh, hold on. I'm gonna take this in the other room.
  I got it!
  Hang up!
  Mother, this could almost have passed for a palatable banana pudding,
  but without Nilla wafers, it's just another one of your wretched
  culinary abortions!
  Clean it up!
  I don't think so.
  Neil, I'm a little out of your league. Besides, I'm going with Lando.
  Really? My underground sources have informed me
  that Lando is taking Connie Demico.
  What?!
  Hey, I thought you were taking me to the dance!
  Uh...
  Something suddenly came up.
  - How could you do this to Meg? - Not now, I gotta write about Oliver
  Twist.
  Oliver Twit, if you ask me. I would have done things rather
  differently, I can tell you that.
  Please, sir, I want some more.
  - What? - Please, sir, I want some more.
  More?!
  All right. Stop it. Stop it right there. Now, go on, fill up the bowl.
  Go on! That's it.
  Now put on this dress.
  Put it on!
  Now dance.
  Hey. Hey, Brian, the guy who wrote this, his name? Charles Dickens.
  - Oh, yeah. - I want an explanation, mister.
  Hey, Connie pulled a power move. When the most popular girl in school
  asks you to the dance, you don't say no, you say "Haba-haba-haba... OK."
  I can't understand why you'd dump your daughter for Connie Demico.
  It's simple transference.
  To Peter, Connie Demico is Phoebe Diamond, the most popular girl in his
  school.
  Oh, my God. I think he's right.
  When I try to speed things up in bed, I'm not thinkin' of Connie, I'm
  thinkin' of Phoebe.
  This whole thing is ridiculous. I forbid you from goin' to that dance.
  You can't tell me what to do. You're not my real mom!
  - End of discussion! - Thank you for ruining my life!
  You don't remember what it's like to be my age!
  I'm two years younger than you!
  I hate you!
  Greg Allman, how did you handle it when life got you down?
  Me? I did a lot of drugs, married some broad named Cher...
  and I wouldn't recommend either one of 'em.
  I gotta fight for my right to party.
  Whoa-ah! Argh!
  - Thanks, Spider-Man. - Everybody gets one.
  - Sweetie? - You married a total jerk!
  Honey, he didn't mean to hurt you. And, you know, you could still go to
  the dance.
  Alone? Why don't I just tattoo a big L on my forehead while I'm at it?
  Now, Meg, you know my feelings on tattoos.
  If you stay home, you're just proving to the other kids that you don't
  belong there.
  - Yeah. - And you might have a really good time.
  I'll tell you one thing. I still regret not goin' to my junior dance.
  But, Daddy, if you don't do what they say, they'll kill me!
  Sorry, pumpkin, we don't negotiate with kidnappers-family policy.
  Daddy, no. Please! Please!
  She'll be all right.
  Come on, what do you say?
  Well... I do have that really slutty dress you hate.
  So, uh, Lando, how old did you say you were again?
  17.
  And a half.
  Sweet statutory, you look beautiful!
  Don't worry, I'll take good care of your kid. I got a daughter of my
  own, you know.
  Please leave the light off. I don't want to be seen.
  I imagine you wouldn't, the way you've been acting.
  - I thought you might say something like that. - Well, you do have it
  coming.
  I convinced Meg to go to the dance, so I'm gonna go drop her off.
  Please don't yell. I've learned my lesson.
  - I wasn't yelling. I was just sayin' that... - Oh, you would bring
  that up.
  - Can't you leave the past where it belongs? - What's wrong with you?
  Because I've already explained that to you. It was a scavenger hunt.
  What the hell is goin' on here?
  Lois, if you still haven't discovered I'm gone, please flip the tape
  over to side B.
  Nice moves, Lando.
  OK, everyone. The votes are in. This year's king and queen are...
  Lando Griffin and Connie Demico!
  Oh, my goodness! Oh!
  Hold it. I can't be your king.
  I have a confession. I've been living a lie!
  I shouldn't be here... with Connie.
  - My first choice was Meg Griffin. - What?
  Meg Griffin! She's right over there in the back.
  Ri... No, no, no, to the left. No, no, you had her. No, no, go back, go
  back.
  You got a monkey workin' the spotlight. No, to the right, genius.
  Th-there. Stop. Stop.
  That's my dream girl. But I'm not good enough for her and she dumped me.
  So now, heartbroken, I will ride recklessly into the night and up Dead
  Man's Curve.
  Goodbye, Meg. I love you.
  - Meg, wanna dance? - I was here first. Meg, dance with me?
  - Neil, would you...? - I would be honoured.
  Thanks!
  And Lando Griffin, a popular student at a local high school,
  was killed last night when his motorcycle careened off Dead Man's Curve.
  Police were baffled when no body was found, but they decided not to ask
  questions
  and just let everyone get on with their lives.
  - I'm so proud of you. - Oh, Daddy, thank you so much!
  - I was the most popular girl at the dance. - Oh, anything for you,
  sweetheart.
  Well, I'm off to popularity. Ciao!
  God, I hate that manly walk of hers.

  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  Billiam, are you there?
  Stewie!
  - Wh-what the devil are you doing here? - Billiam sent me.
  He wanted me to tell you I killed him.
  Now give me the other half of the amulet. I don't think you'll be
  making it to Marrakech.
  Don't! Please!
  No!
  Jeffrey, take the 9pm to Hounslow out of your mouth.
  Oh, look at that. Our little boys are becomin' fast friends.
  I say, Jeffrey, be a sport, will you, and go get the sifter so we can
  build our sand village.
  That's right. A little further.
  Everyone, meet Jeffrey, the newest member of the club of forgotten
  children.
  Steve walks warily down the street with his brim pulled way down low
  - What the hell are you doing? - Takin' down the Christmas decorations.
  Peter, I'm concerned about Stewie. He doesn't seem to play well with
  other children.
  Oh, he's fine. You know, I was quite a troublemaker myself when I was a
  kid.
  Your parents'll be home any minute. Are you sure you don't want me to
  clean up?
  No, no, no. Go. Go. It'll be funny.
  Stewie needs to learn to socialise with other children.
  - Maybe we should put him in daycare. - Lois, his answers are out on
  the open road.
  I say we give him a hobo pack on a stick, a can of beans and a
  pocketful of dreams.
  Peter, do you even know which one of our children I'm talking about?
  Gordon?
  I got 'em! Ha-ha-ha! It's just like hunting.
  Chris, stop it. What will the neighbours think?
  Abner! Abner! The Griffin boy just killed a plastic reindeer!
  Gladys, it took me two hours to work up the courage to rent this porno.
  Now, are you gonna watch it with me or not?
  OK, Mommy's leaving you here for a while. Try to play nice with the
  other children.
  What do you mean, you're leaving me here? What is this place?
  - Come on, let go. - Why, you soulless witch!
  This is a biogenetic experimentation facility, isn't it? Admit it!
  Oh, sweetheart, don't be upset. You're gonna have fun here.
  Look, if this is about the whole me-killing-you thing, it was a bit!
  I was doing shtick, I tell you!
  Humina-humina-humina!
  Oh! I'm so bored. Without Stewie around, I have nothin' to do.
  - Well... we could get hammered. - Oh, it's too early for me, but you
  go ahead.
  What happened to me?
  You know, before I was married, I led a very exciting life.
  Oh, my God! The actress who was the girl in Escape from Witch Mountain!
  Maybe a part-time job would liven up your days.
  Brian! That's a terrific idea!
  A job? Lois, the '70s are over. Forget it.
  Mom, you can't get a job. The last time you left Dad home alone,
  he turned the house into a giant puppet.
  Hey. Hey! Stay outta here. Hey!
  Nobody better come in here. I'm the Griffins' house.
  Bring me a tool shed, for I am hungry.
  Uh... If you get a job,
  who's gonna feed me and protect me from the evil monkey in my closet?
  Now, Chris, you know there's no such thing.
  No!
  - Oh, now you've gone and upset the boy. - Peter, this is a new chapter
  in my life.
  The kids are growin', the nest is empty, and I need some excitement.
  What are you talkin' about? Your life is plenty exciting. For example...
  There you go! Good night.
  Duck.
  Duck. Duck.
  I say, does anyone know how The Practice ended last night? I dozed off.
  Goose!
  Oh, dear. It seems you're still it.
  Stewie, what have you done? That's not the way we play.
  You sit here, Brad. Stewie's it.
  Ooh! Aren't you the one in charge!
  Oh, let's see, now. Duck. Duck.
  Duck.
  Goose!
  Oh, come on, now. I barely touched you.
  Really. Stop it. Stop your boohooing. Stop it, I say. Stop it!
  You see? You see? This is exactly why people don't respect the WNBA.
  Hey, guys, guys, get this. So Lois wants a part-time job, right?
  So I'm, like, I got a job for you, baby... right here!
  The zipper's been broken for over a month. I gotta use a damn safety
  pin.
  If Lois is lookin' for a thrill, I could get her a job with the airline.
  Stewardesses get to travel to exotic places, and their husbands fly
  anywhere for free.
  Fly for free?
  Sorry, Tink. Looks like I don't need you any more.
  So, what? You're just gonna dump me? Just like that?
  You knew what this was.
  A flight attendant? Wow, that does sound exciting. What made you change
  your mind?
  - Just my desire to see you happy. - Oh!
  And to exploit your hard labour for free travel.
  - What? - Shh!
  I didn't say anything. Go to sleep, crazy lady.
  Oh, Rupert, I can't sleep. I don't suppose you have any Valium on you?
  No, of course not. You're living the clean life now. It's that pathetic
  little insect in daycare.
  Janet.
  Whining, insignificant wisp of fluff, she is.
  Still, I find it odd that she's even on my mind at all. What the deuce
  has come over me?
  Well, well, well.
  - Looks like someone's in love. - Ha! That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
  - Excluding that first "Ha". - You're a sucker for a woman with blue
  eyes.
  - Aha! Her eyes are green! - Thank you for proving my point.
  Damn!
  Look at her, Leonard, sitting there with her curly ebony locks
  and those pouty come-hither lips. My God, she's unappealing.
  - Go! - Who said that? Mm?
  Who's got the big diapers? Huh?
  She's gone. Good. Well, I'm off.
  Hi, Stewie.
  H... Um... Er... Y-y...
  Leonard, you pudgy-faced apple-john, I will not be made a fool of!
  Here's your pillow, sir. And your Sports Illustrated.
  - He's putting his arm on my armrest. - It's my armrest.
  Is not, stupid head! And he keeps tryin' to take my apple juice.
  - I'll bring you your own juice. - Agh!
  Hey, he keeps licking his finger and touching me!
  Hey, fellas, I hope you're hungry. Aagh!
  Oh, my God! Oh, no, my Go...
  Somebody help. Help. Help!
  That was great. Look at her, she's still shakin'.
  Bastards.
  That was beautiful. Hey, throw me a beer, would ya?
  Stewardess, the plane just made my beer spill. I want a free one.
  Sir, all your beers have been free. All nine of them.
  And don't you forget it, Frenchie.
  Now bring me another one - the movie's startin'.
  Oh, come on.
  Show me Morgan Fairchild in deep something. Huh? Huh? Huh?
  Ah, you don't care. Hey, Frenchie, is my fort ready?
  Yes, Mr Griffin, even though no one else has any pillows now.
  All right!
  I tell you, Leonard, women are wicked creatures.
  They precipitated the downfall of history's most powerful men!
  So let it be known I want absolutely nothing to do with the wretched
  enterprise of love!
  Janet's coming.
  Agh!
  Argh!
  Aa... Er, yes. Yes.
  Hi. Cookie?
  No, no, actually, it's Stewie, but, well, you can call me Cookie if you
  like.
  Yes. I... Yes, I've also been known to answer to Artemis, Agent
  Buchwald and Snake.
  Yes. Yes, I rather like "Snake".
  Snake Griffin.
  Cookie!
  Oh! Oh, you want my cookie? Oh, yes, by all means. Here you are.
  Oops, a little bit broke off there.
  Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles!
  Yes. Yes. Yes, you'II... you'll get that one halfway back to your mat.
  Ha! Ha... Oh, God.
  Oh, Cupid, hast thou pierced me with thine sweet, searing arrow?
  Stomach, cease thy lustful quake.
  Argh! Unhand me, woman. I don't have gas, I'm in love!
  Well, then, I guess it's both.
  Peter! I'm home!
  How was your day?
  Uh, my day?
  Hey. Hey.
  You OK there, Mr Crocodile? Huh?
  Wake up, wake up, wake up. You need some lotion, Mr Bad Skin?
  Huh? Huh? Huh? There you go.
  Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh! Agh!
  Oh, uh, my-my-my day was OK.
  You know, the usual. How about yours, my little sky princess? Bet it
  was excitin'.
  Oh, yeah, if you like runnin' through a gauntlet of drunk, horny
  businessmen.
  My ass feels like a pincushion. I'm thinkin' of quittin'.
  What? Lois, you can't quit. What if Kurt Cobain had quit?
  Thank you. And remember, say no to drugs.
  Kurt, the label's excited about your seventh album.
  Thanks. You remember my wife Courtney Love?
  Who?
  Well, I guess I'll give it a little more time. It's like I always tell
  the kids -
  - A quitter never wins, and don't trust whitey. - That's the spirit.
  All right, here I go.
  - Stewie! - Hello, Janet. How about a push?
  Argh!
  Yes. Yes, I suppose that was rather funny, wasn't it?
  You know, it's odd, Janet, but when I'm with you, I... Oh, how do I
  describe it?
  Excuse me?
  - I said "May I have a blanket?" - Oh, yes. Of course.
  Ha! I said "Will you be my wife?" You said yes, so it is official. Let
  me touch your face.
  Lois, we could use your help in coach.
  OK. Everyone? It's time for my one-man show -
"Winston Churchill, We Hardly Knew Ye".
OK, Act One.
I'm Winston Churchill. Ooh, would you like some tea?
I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.
Would you like a crumpet? I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.
Would you like to wear knickers? I would, because I'm W...
- My wife is very ill! - Yes, do you mind?
I paid $380 for this flight.
$380? Jeez, I hope they kissed you first.
This is my fourth trip today. Just this mornin' I went to Kentucky.
Wait a second. You're tellin' me I flew all the way to Kentucky to get
  some fried chicken,
  and the Colonel isn't even workin' today?
  He ain't real. He dead.
  - What? - I say he dead.
  Is Mr Sanders in?
  What wrong with you? I say you he dead.
  The Colonel!
  My wife is a stewardess, so I can fly anywhere and I don't pay jack!
  - Peter! - Lois!
  You convinced me to keep a job I hate just so you could fly free?!
  If I talked real loud like that, I could make you look like the bad guy.
  My feet are killing me, I've got vomit in my pocket
  and I've seen that crappy Julia Roberts movie 47 times!
  Have you seen the lips on that woman? It's like a baboon's ass on her
  face!
  Peter, I took this job for the excitement, and you're the one who's
  havin' it all!
  Oh, it's excitement you want, huh? Well, how'd you like to join the
  Mile High Club?
  Come on. You be the stewardess, and I'll be the mysterious stranger
  who's drillin' you.
  - Ugh! Move. I have a lot of work to do. - I can't, I'm stuck.
  - The passengers need me. - They're watchin' the movie. They're fine.
  OK, everyone, this is a hijacking.
  Peter, could you move your arm, please?
  - Uh. Yeah. Lois. Lois. - Please. Move it over. Try to the...
  - God, it's like movin' a futon. - Lois!
  - Just slide your leg over... Peter, please! - Oh. Oh, no, no. Oh! Oh!
  Well, Lois, at least one of us is in the Mile High Club.
  Well, the hijacking of Flight 52 is over. The plane has safely landed
  in Cuba,
  and all Americans aboard are on their way home, except one couple -
  a fat man who is inexplicably married to an attractive redhead.
  Here's an artist's rendering of what they might look like.
  I called Brian. He's gonna watch the kids till we get back. When will
  our passports arrive?
  - Check back in two weeks. - Two weeks?! But I have a baby at home!
  We would have sent you with the others, but we didn't know you were
  stuck in the toilet.
  - We weren't doin' what you're thinking. - I was.
  - We apologise for the hijacking. - Ah, that's OK.
  You people aren't like the communists they show on TV.
  We now return to "The Communists".
  I hear report cards vere handed out today. Vot were your grades?
  Uh... uh... uh...
  Qvit Stalin and answer your father.
  Go ahead, honey, and tell us your... Marx.
  - Do I Khrushchev? - Did somebody say Khrushchev?
  I say, Janet, do you like this couch?
  Oh, you truly are beautiful, you know that?
  - Oh, Janet, our future is so bright. - Cookie?
  Oh, yes, there'll be lots of cookies. There'll be dancing, Christmas
  mornings,
  and arguments over the proper way to discipline the children, and...
  What are you doing? What the hell is this?
  Is there something you need to tell me? If I'm the only one in this
  thing, I deserve to know.
  I see. Your silence says it all.
  This is great. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
  We gotta get some fake passports on the black market.
  Where are you going? You're never gonna find the black market.
  That's what you said about that back-alley abortionist.
  I'm glad you changed your mind. But the point is, I found the guy.
  OK, there she is. That is...
  That is absolutely classic! Melinda, you're an utter delight.
  Oh, hello, Janet. Yes. Yes, you know Melinda.
  Yes, it seems she's, um... Oh, what did we figure out, dear? Was it
  one? No, two. Yes.
  She's two weeks younger than you. Just look at that butt. That is a
  tight butt.
  Damn! Not even a second glance.
  This is what you call dolled up? Why don't you save yourself years of
  sexual ambiguity
  and get fitted for a pair of Doc Martens and a plaid flannel shirt?
  There it is. The black market.
  Lois, if we don't make it outta here alive,
  I should tell ya I promised my first girlfriend we'd meet up in heaven.
  I was lyin', but just so you know it's somethin' we might have to deal
  with.
  OK. Two American passports. Would you like to join the black market
  club?
  - Ten per cent off your first purchase. - No, thank you. We're not from
  the area.
  Peter, just pay the man.
  - Do you accept bits of string? - Sorry. Store policy.
  But, you know, there is another way for you to travel.
  It's over, Leonard. I suppose I should be grateful to that saucy harlot.
  She taught me a valuable lesson. There's really no such thing as love.
  It's just a word used by Madison Avenue to sell their skin creams and
  two-seater cars.
  Argh! It's no use! She swims in my blood now. I must have her!
  Darling, why are we tormenting ourselves? We're perfect for each other.
  I admit we've got our problems, like any couple, but true love conquers
  all!
  - I like you. - You... like me?
  Oh! Oh, well, it's not love, but it's a start.
  Oh, Janet, you've made me the happiest man in the whole world.
  - Cookie? - Of course you can have a cookie! Stay there.
  Cookie.
  Cookie?
  Cookie?
  Cookie?
  You don't care about me. It's my cookies! It's always been the damn
  cookies!
  Well, sugar, the bakery just closed.
  You'll have to get your fill somewhere else, you oatmeal-raisin-Ioving
  tart!
  Don't let her see you cry, old man. Don't let her see you cry.
  Well, we're finally goin' home.
  I'm sorry I tricked you into that job, honey. You deserve to have a
  more excitin' life.
  Oh, Peter, bein' married to you gives me all the excitement I can
  handle.
  I mean, look at us-on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic,
  under the moonlight, surrounded by refugees.
  Yeah. Uh, about that. Uh...
  Miguel over there has had his eye on you, and his wife Rosa is very
  open.
  - What? - No, nothin'. This is nice.

Title: There's Something About Paulie

It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  Wakey, wakey, worthless domestic. Time to make the inedible gruel.
  Mommy wants to rest for a few more minutes, honey.
  Blast!
  Whaddaya doin' lyin' on the couch at this hour? You been drinkin'?
  - Peter, you know I never drink. - Just like you never dodged the draft?
  What are you talkin' about? I'm a woman.
  Sure you are... now.
  Peter, I'm exhausted. I've been in and outta taxis all day.
  Stewie had a doctor's appointment, then I had to pick Meg up after
  school.
  I had rehearsal for Death of a Salesman, but we can't show death at
  school,
  so now at the end, we dance around with sparklers.
  Peter, we really need a second car.
  Trying to do all these errands in a taxi is exhausting.
  Oh, but you meet such colourful characters in taxis, like Alex Rieger
  and Tony.
  And that funny foreign guy, in the garage.
  Rieger, cab 402. Nardo, you and your luscious melons are in 315.
  - Now get outta here, you losers. - What about the foreign guy?
  No way. He's a nut job.
  Show some compassion for once in your miserable life.
  All right, can the waterworks, Jackie Chan, cab 302.
  Ayii-a!
  Thank you very much.
  Peter, please. I saw an ad for a used car that would be perfect.
  Oh, no, Lois. A guy at work bought a car outta the paper. Ten years
  later, bam! Herpes.
  I'm buying our car from a dealer and that's that.
  Oh, look. Oh, aren't you beautiful?
  Yeah. Yeah, you like that, don't ya?
  Yeah, you're a bad little car.
  What's that? What's that? You want me inside ya?
  Peter, look at this one. It's safe and reliable and we can afford it.
  I'll just see if I can find a salesman.
  Hey, I'm Doug, nice to meet ya. Whoa, have you lost weight?
  It's still there. I'm parting it on the side.
  We were more interested in that car over there.
  - Lois, let me handle this. - Peter, this car has dents in it.
  And it's got a cardboard steering wheel.
  - Yeah, just a second, honey. - And, look, there's no engine.
  - It just has a drawing of an engine. - But it only had one previous
  owner.
  - James Bond. - I'll take it.
  OK, let's see what this baby can do, eh?
  Ha! Well, I'm sure the dealer will take care of it.
  Lois, this is crazy.
  There's no way we can have maritals with you lying all the way over
  there.
  I am very upset with you right now.
  OK, so I tried on your bra. Jeez, the fellas were puttin' on a show.
  I didn't think I'd make a good Gigi either, but, God help me, I was
  flattered.
  Peter, I'm upset because you never listen to me.
  This is Atlantic City all over again.
  - You've got 20. - Hit me.
  - 21. - Hit me. Hit me.
  - That's 30. - Hit me.
  Ha! You're just mad about the car. Don't worry. I'll think of a way to
  fix it.
  No, we'll think of a way to fix it.
  I'm tired of being left out of all our decision making.
  OK, honey.
  By the way, I bought a chimp.
  Hey, Peter, you want a menu, or just the usual everything?
  - Aw, shut up, Cleveland. - Wanna talk about it, champ?
  Lois has had the car all week and it's just been hell gettin' around.
  I actually had to rent a Mustang.
  All because I can't afford to get our new car fixed.
  Why don't you just get another new car?
  Why don't you try a breath mint, saucy?
  I'm just sayin' that me and my associates will steal your car,
  and ipso facto your insurance company'll buy you another one.
  Peter, you don't wanna get involved with the Mob.
  Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?
  - I'm the proprietor of this delicatessen. - Butt out, shlomo. All I
  need is your address.
  - You can jot it down on the back of my gun. - Well, you do have an
  honest face.
  Ah, crap. I made a mistake. Do you have another gun?
  Dharma, come down from there. Wow, I can't get over what a free spirit
  you are.
  Lois, can you go down to the basement and do somethin' really loud and
  complicated
  for the next 15 minutes?
  - That's a fine machine, Peter. - Peter, how can we afford this?
  Let's just say the car was a steal.
  - Say that again. - The car was a steal.
  - This time without winking. - The car was a steal.
  Wink.
  Look, Lois, we had a broken car, I did "something", and now we have a
  new car.
  - Look, I said I'd handle it, and I did. - I suppose you did.
  I just wish my opinion mattered to you.
  Well, the important thing is it matters to you. And that's the greatest
  gift of all.
  Hey, Cleveland, check out my on-board computer navigation system.
  Standard.
  - Left turn ahead. - Spanish.
  - Va a la izquierda allá. - Yakov Smirnoff.
  In Soviet Russia, car drives you.
  That's fancy an' all. But I think you're bargainin' for more than you
  can chew.
  You're in debt to the Mob. That means they can ask you to do anything.
  - Anything! - Relax, Cleveland, there is no Mob.
  You're thinkin' of the Mob in the movies.
  - How am I funny? - I dunno know. You say funny things.
  No, no. I mean, am I George Carlin funny,
  am I Spin City funny, Rita Rudner funny, what? Come on.
  - Rita Rudner funny. - Yeah, Rita Rudner funny.
  Really? Oh, my God. Thank you.
  Peter, please don't underestimate them.
  I guarantee ya, I am never gonna hear from those guys again.
  Peter, it is time to repay your favour to the don.
  Aw, jeez.
  At least that's one problem solved.
  C'mon, Peter, the don is waiting to meet you.
  What kind of a guy... what's he like? Is he a friendly don?
  You know, like that Dom DeLuise.
  I have asked you here tonight so that you may perform a service.
  Whaddaya gonna make me do? Whack a guy? Off a guy? Whack off a guy?
  Silence. Big Fat Paulie's in town this week to attend the wedding of my
  daughter.
  You want me to shoot him twice in the head.
  That's sweet of you to ask, but he's my nephew.
  He's also vile and disgusting.
  No one's been able to stand Big Fat Paulie's company for more than a
  minute.
  But you, Mr Griffin, you will take him to the movies.
  That's it? That's all I have to do? Ah, thank Go... Wait a second.
  Which movie?
  Because if it's anything with Greg Kinnear, you can just whack me off
  right now.
  Big Fat Paulie?
  The name's Marty, and I'm very sensitive about my weight.
  - Big Fat Paulie? - How dare you?
  Are you Big Fat Paulie?
  I'm Louie Anderson.
  Are you-please, God - Big Fat Paulie?
  - Yeah, I'm Big Fat Paulie. - Hey. Guess I've got milk.
  Don't shoot me!
  Aw. Someone's sittin' in my most favourite seat.
  Hm. Hey, I just got a great idea.
  Girlfriend, you know what time it is?
  - No, what time is it? - It's time for you to get your groove back.
  Again.
  Well, uh...
  - Bye. - Where you goin'?
  - Home? You know, for dinner. - Oh, yeah? What are we havin'?
  Oh, uh... I was only supposed to go to a movie with ya.
  - What's that supposed to mean? - Well, I mean, you know, like...
  like no neckin'.
  So I can have dinner with you.
  Uh... uh, sure.
  That'd be better than having dinner with my family who I love and am
  not afraid of.
  Hey, Lois, this is Big Fat Paulie.
  - He's gonna be joinin' us for dinner. - Really? What a nice surprise.
  Peter, can I talk to you for a second?
  You can't just bring company home at the last second without calling.
  I am gettin' tired of you doin' everything without consultin' me. And...
  - Do you mind? - As a matter of fact, I do, you crazy broad.
  I am not a crazy broad.
  Oh, no, no, Lois. He didn't mean you're crazy like Elizabeth Taylor.
  You know, he meant you're crazy like...
  like that glue. You stick to things.
  You know, like an adhesive. That's all he meant.
  You have a pretty good appetite there, kid. I bet you spend a lot of
  time in the john.
  Sorry, what finishing school did you say you went to?
  Yes, good heavens. Who taught you how to eat? Mickey Rourke?
  Why do I know that name? Damn you, Entertainment Tonight!
  Hi, I'm Bob Goen, and these are Mary Hart's legs.
  Mary, you recently spent some time with Julia Roberts, didn't you?
  Mary says yes.
  Tell me, kid, what are you, like, 27?
  - I'm 13. - Still a minor, huh?
  - Hey, son, how'd you like to be a coke mule? - Peter, living room?
  No, Lois, kitchen.
  Peter, I have a bad feelin' about this man.
  He's not the kind of person I want hangin' around our family.
  - Honey, you're overreactin'. - Will you please just listen to me for
  once?
  That man is bad news. I want him out of our house and out of our lives.
  I'm gonna give you something to help you relax...
  - Now! - OK.
  Big Fat Paulie? There's somethin' I gotta tell ya.
  Ever stare at the night sky and wonder if someone might be lookin' back
  at ya?
  No, but just in case... Look at this, you freakin' aliens!
  Oh, uh... Hi, Bonnie.
  This is my friend, Big Fat Paulie, and, uh... this is his big fat ass.
  - What's on your mind, Petie? - Look, uh, we can't be friends any more.
  - Oh. - I'm sorry.
  Hey, forget about it.
  Aw, jeez. It's not you, it's Lois. She doesn't want me hangin' around
  with ya.
  - Really? You're not just sayin' that? - No, no. It's all Lois.
  If only I'd met you first... But whaddaya gonna do?
  - So, Lois is the problem, huh? - Yeah, but it's not her fault.
  She just doesn't wanna see me fall in with a tough crowd again.
  Cavity creeps!
  We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!
  So, if she wasn't around, we could still be friends, right?
  - Yeah, sure. Why not? - Oh, that's great.
  Come here, you.
  Willy Loman never made a lot of money,
  his name was never in the paper,
  but, uh... You know, like, attention could be paid.
  People are worse off than Willy Loman.
  Jeez, come on, everybody. I know it sucks, but they're just kids.
  Peter, how can you sleep? I was almost killed.
  Aw, come on, Lois. The only victim tonight was the work of Arthur
  Miller.
  Hello.
  Hey, Big Fat Paulie.
  No, Lois isn't dead yet.
  Whaddaya mean, you're gonna fire that hit man?
  Whaddaya mean, you thought she'd be six feet under and we'd be able to
  catch a movie?
  Whad...?
  - You thought I wanted you to whack Lois? - Guilty.
  - It's not too late to have the hit called off? - Yeah.
  Gotcha.
  All I gotta do is make a call.
  Aw, jeez. You OK?
  Oh, my God. Look at this.
  How could you bring a mobster into your own home?
  If you're upset now, wait till ya hear the rest.
  I was talkin' to Big Fat Paulie the other day and one thing led to
  another, and...
  - I sort of put a hit out on ya. - How could you put a hit on me?
  That's not even the worst part. Wait. Yeah, it is.
  - Peter! - Look, don't worry. I got it all worked out.
  We'll move to England. Worst they got there is, uh, you know, drive-by
  arguments.
  I say, Jeremy, isn't that Reginald B Stiffworth,
  the chap who's been touting the merits of a United European
  Commonwealth?
  - Why, yes, I dare say that's the fellow. - Oh, let's get him.
  Oh, Reginald.
  I disagree.
  - I would like a "bunny". - What kind of "bunny"?
  A semi-automatic bunny or a hand-held bunny.
  Whichever bunny you think is better for shooting a guy in the head.
  I've been lookin' all over for ya. Look, I gotta call off the hit on my
  wife.
  - Where's the don? - The don?
  - I don't know what you're talking about. - Aw, come on, you know, the
  don.
  - The captain of the Mafia. - Peter, there is no such thing as the
  Mafia.
"The don's daughter is getting married tomorrow. Here's my invitation."
"Now, get the asterisk, percent, ampersand, out of here, you SOB."
What's a SOB?
- Dharma, come down from that couch. - Uh-uh, goofy. Why don't you come
  up?
  You know what? I think I will.
  Boy, what a mismatched pair. A free spirit and a puppet.
  Peter, thank God. Did you take care of...
  - That thing? - That thing? Oh, oh, you mean that growth.
  Yeah, I had the doctor look at that.
  Mr Griffin, that isn't a growth. That's your penis.
  Oh. Well, what about the...?
  Testicles.
  Huh.
  - I'm talkin' about the mob hit. - Mom's gonna get whacked?
  - What did you do? - Oh dear, there are so many people to thank.
  God, of course, and um... who else?
  Oh, this is so unexpected.
  - Oh, yes, Satan. - I'm sorry, Lois. The hit's still on.
  - All I got was this wedding invitation. - Wait a second, Peter.
  The don's daughter's wedding. That's perfect.
  It's not that perfect. We'll probably have to buy a gift.
  And you know how bad I am at buyin' gifts.
  Happy freakin' birthday, Lois.
  Oh, my goodness. It's a...
  Ah, another sword.
  - Thank you, Peter. - Go ahead, try it on.
  Didn't you see The Godfather? The don can't refuse a favour on his
  daughter's wedding.
  - So? - So we can ask him for a favour.
  - So? - So we ask him to call off the hit.
  - So? - So...
  Peter, I don't know how to explain it any clearer than that.
  You can ask them not to kill Mom.
  No way, it's too dangerous. I got you into this and I'll get you out of
  it.
  No, Peter, when we got married we agreed to share our lives.
  - Good times and bad. - So?
  - So we'll solve this problem. - Wait. You mean, together?
  Yes, because together we can do anything, face any foe, overcome any
  obstacle.
  Yeah, climb any mountain, rent any video, dial any phone.
  And not just our phone, Lois, other people's phones.
  Decent phones, God-fearing phones,
  phones that everybody else gave up on, but we knew better, because we
  were a team.
  What the hell are you talking about?
  Turn right at fork in road.
  - In Soviet Russia, road forks you. - Boy, is that gettin' old.
  I don't know. What if somethin' happens to ya? I'm too old to start
  dating again.
  OK, bachelor number one. I'm an ice-cream cone. How are you gonna eat
  me?
  I'd invite my friend Rudy over and the two of us would give you a
  double dip.
  OK. Bachelor number two?
  I'd lick off all the cream and give you my special whip topping.
  Sounds good. Bachelor number three?
  Well, I would try to eat you really fast, before I got flaccid.
  - I'll be fine. All we have to do is blend in. - No problem.
  For my next number...
  Thank you very much.
  - David Schwimmer? - Yeah. Hey.
  - What are you gonna ask the don for? - World peace.
  - Number 34. Three-four. - Right here.
  Peter, my good friend. How good of you to come and show your respect,
  on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
  Yeah, sorry I didn't bring a gift, but the stores were mobbed.
  Uh, I mean, mobbed as in crowded.
  Not... not mobbed as in... you guys.
  Who is this enchanting woman?
  This is my wife, Lois. Ah!
  Your honour, sir, we've come to ask...
  - Let me handle this. - Peter, I thought we were a team.
  Listen, Your Don-ness. I got a little favour to ask.
  Go ahead. I am obligated to grant one favour on this, the day of my
  daughter's wedding.
  While you ask me for this one and only favour,
  I will sit here and enjoy this very fine tiramisu.
  - Oh, can I have a piece? - Granted.
  - Next. - Aw, crap.
  I'm sorry I used up our favour, Lois.
  You know what? Here. It's yours. No, no, really. I insist.
  Peter, I'm gonna be killed. Does that mean nothing to you?
  Of course it does. It means everything to me.
  - Oh, God. What have I done? - I'm not marrying you.
  I'm not marrying you, you spoiled guinea... Whoops.
  My daughter, what is the problem on this, the day of my daughter's
  wedding?
  Larry wants to whack someone on our honeymoon.
  Hey, it's my job, all right? This is what I do.
  You two should stop fighting and listen to each other.
  See, marriage is a partnership. If you really love someone, you gotta
  work together,
  as a team. I... I learned that the hard way.
  I didn't listen to what my wife had to say and now she's as good as
  dead.
  - Oh, Peter. - That's awful. Is this your wife?
  Yeah, that's Lois. Ah!
  I guess we could postpone our trip.
  We won't have to. I don't believe this. She's the one I'm supposed to
  whack.
  - Peter. - Please, you gotta do me one more favour.
  Look, I love my wife more than anything in the world.
  Can you please shoot me instead of her?
  Such tenderness and love on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
  - Why don't I just call off the hit? - Oh. Yeah, that could work.
  Wait. We're a team. Is that OK with you? Because your opinion matters
  too.
  Yes, let's get the hell outta here. Thank you for a lovely time.
  - Yeah, it's the blue sedan. - No tip, sir.
  Ah, nice kid. Well, I think I handled that pretty good.
  But... but I would like a second opinion.
  Here it is.
  - Oh, my God, our car! - Man, am I glad I caught you.
  I almost forgot. Don't start your car...
  - Hey, thanks for comin'. - Oh, what a horrible night.
  It's not so bad, Lois. I learned my lesson.
  And best of all, nobody important got hurt.

  Lois: "It doesn't matter if your nose is a little bulbubsy, or your
  eyes are too close together, or your chest is flabby. You are who you
  are!"
  Peter: "I think I know what you're getting at."
  ---Scene Sixteen---
  <Inside House Lois, Brian, Chris, Meg.>
  <Enter Some Guy>
  Some Guy: "Knock, knock." <Sounds like peter>
  Brian: "Hey pal, you can't just walk in here withou… Holy
  crap its peter!"
  Chris: "Dad, your pretty, like a girl!"
  Meg: "You look like a totally different person!"
  Lois: "Oh this is crazy, you walk in here with your chisel jaw, and
  your, oh my! Uh, I liked you the way you were! Your not even real
  anymore, you, Peter did you get a new buttox?"
  Peter: "I had to, my old one had a crack in it! He, he, he, he."
  Lois: "Well, I couldn't be more angry with you, oh!" <Drooling
  like "ah".>
  Lois: "You, you really let this family down, we should be embracing the
  things god gave us! Not telling our kids that a person is not as good
  someone else, because of the way they look."
  <Lois Runs and jumps on peter>
  Peter: "Ah, holy crap."
  <Some how Stewie rolls out into the trash cans, and gets stuck
  in one.>
  <Enter Fidious and Barnabey.>
  Barnabey: "Look there's a baby in that refuse bin!"
  Fidious: "Not to close barnabey, if you touch it the mother won't take
  it back!"
  Fidious: "Aleoup!"

  bike. Old fashioned bike. And Ride away.>

  Warren: (Chuckles) "Warren Fredricks, Quahog Beautiful People's Club.
  C'mon in front!"
  Peter: "But, all, all those people were in front of me!"
  Warren: "You haven't been beautiful very long have you? Gorgeous guys
  like us don't have to wait in line, haven't you noticed, people will do
  anything for a beautiful person!"
  Peter: "Yeah, you know, come to think of it!"
  <Enter Dream State.>
  <Peter opens door, a hot chick stands in the doorway. >
  H. Chick "Hi, I'm on a scavenger hunt, and I need a human foot?"
  Peter: "Well, As a rule I would say no, but okay come in."
  <Brings Chick in, and sits down, rolls up his pant leg, and
  picks up his saw, and starts cutting. >
  Peter: "So, uh, this is what this is like for a school project or, ah,
  aghhhhhh!"
  <Exit Dream State. >
  BagLady: "Raoul Please take this hansom gentlemen's bags to his car."
  <Raoul runs up and takes peters bags. >
  Peter: "Thank you."
  <Peter and Warren walk out of the store. Walks on a black mat.
  Door's open. >
  Peter: "Hey, when your beautiful, door magically open for you."
  Warren: "Actually, it opened because you stepped on that black rubber
  square. Of course if that wasn't there, it would have opened anyway,
  because your beautiful!"
  Peter: "Wow!"
  ---Scene Eighteen---
  <Inside a nice building, with a lot of beautiful people. Peter
  and Warren walk in. >
  Peter: "Hey, there's a lot of good looking people here."
  Warren: "Of Course, this is the Quahog Beautiful People's Club, and
  you're our newest member. Here's your introductory basket, its got some

  (Creak…)
  (Crash,)
  Stewie: "Ah, Damn-It!"
  Brian: "Oh what happened, Orson fall down?"
  Stewie: "Shut up, I, I don't want to hear it!"
  Brian: "Well, serves you right, you spent all that time trying to make
  Chris jealous, and now you have an eating disorder!"
  Stewie: "Just, Help me up."
  Brian: "You know I would, but my doctor advised me against heavy
  lifting!"
  Stewie: "Oh, Har, Di, Har, Har."
  <Brian starts to spin Stewie.>
  Stewie: "What, What the devil are you doing?"
  <Spinning faster>
  Stewie: "Stop it, Stop it, I'm getting dizzy!"
  <Faster>
  Stewie: "Ah, Blast!"
  ---Scene Twenty---
  <Living room, Peter, Lois>
  Lois: "Peter, did you paste a new picture of your self, on our wedding
  portrait?"
  Peter: "Yeah, I think it looks better."
  Lois: "You pasted it over me!"
  Peter: "Yeah, I think it looks better."
  Lois: (Gasp) "Have you lost your mind?"
  Peter: "Well, somebody's jealous!"
  Lois: "Peter, have you forgotten about Chris? He need's you to help him
  exercise."
  Brian: "Yeah, he finally figured out how to catch the Twinkie!"
  <Chris leans back, and takes the Twinkie off the string. >
  Chris: "Ha, ha, I'm turning you into Pooh!"
  Peter: "Well, I'm going to the beautiful people's club. I guess I can
  him with me. Hell, seeing us all in one place, might give something to
  shoot for."
  Lois: "The Beautiful People's club, ha, how, how come I've never heard
  of that?"
  Peter: "Lois, I can't say anymore. I'm probably already in trouble for
  mentioning to, a, uh, well, we, call you Normies. Okay bye!
  <Lois follows peter out the door, Brian follows Lois.>
  Brian: "Are you going to take that?"
  <No answer>
  Brian: "LOIS!"
  Lois: "What, oh Brian, I was, was, just, seeing, if the, driveway"
  Brian: "That wasn't even a sentence! You were hoggling peter like horny
  school girl!"
  Lois: "Oh, I can't help it! I know, I know, he's become a superficial,
  ego maniacal, jerk, but, I've never been more attracted to him! Oh,
  does that make me a bad person?"
  Brian: "Yes, Yes it does make you a bad person!"
  ---Scene Twenty-one---
  <In front of the BPC.>
  Warren: "Peter good to see you, come with me I've got a lot of tall
  statuesque people I want you to meet. What's that?"
  Peter: "That's my son Chris!"
  Warren: "He can't come in, (Scoffs), he's fat!"
  Peter: "Well, let me tell you something buddy, if my son can't come in,
  then I'll just come in!"
  <To Chris>
  Peter: "See ya at home."
  Chris: "But dad?"
  Peter: "Trust me Chris, sometimes its better not to fit in!"
  <Cut to dreamish-memory-thingy. A dark field with, a lot of guys
  in B.D.U.s (Battle Dress Uniforms), Except for peter, in a clown
  costume.>
  Peter: "You're all stupid, see their gonna be looking for army guys!"
  ---Scene Twenty-two---
  <Back at the hotel. Enter Chris>
  Chris: "Don't look at me! I'm hideous!"
  Lois: "Peter, how could you treat Chris that way, you know he's self
  conscious about his weight!"
  Peter: "What are you mad at me for? After all he gets his fat from your
  jeans. Which by the way I'm wearing!"
  Lois: "Oh, I hate what you've become! Why don't you back to that doctor
  and have him suck the fat out of your head!"
  Peter: "Maybe I will! And then I'll put it on my feet, and skate on
  Paul bunion giant skillet, to cook his flapjacks!"
  Lois: "That doesn't make any sense!"
  Peter: "It doesn't have to, I'm beautiful!"
  Chris: "You're not welcome here, go away!"
  <Enter Meg>
  Meg: "Wow, Chris, did you lose weight?"
  Chris: "Uh maybe, I've been working out."
  Meg: "Well, you look wicked skinny, I'm like jealous!"
  Chris: "Thanks Meg, I'm jealous of your mustache!"
  Meg: "I don't have a mustache, do I?"
  Lois: "oh hunny, its fine, it makes you look distinguished."
  Meg: "But mom!"
  Lois: "Now Meg I think all my children are beautiful."
  <Outside Stewie is siting on the steps, trying to eat ice cream.
  >
  Stewie: "Damn you, ice cream, come to my mouth. How dare you disobey
  me!"
  <A mother and young child in a stroller walk by.>
  Stewie: "What are you looking at, you infantile, stupid, that's right,
  damn you and such. You can go (yawning) burn in hell."

  ---Scene twenty-three---
  <Peter driving in his car down the street.>
  Peter: "She is so jealous, of course I'm beautiful, I mean look at me."
  <Peter looks at himself in the rearview mirror.>
  Peter: "Oh, how strange must watch road, can't look away, too
  beautiful!"
  <Still looking in the mirror.>
  <Car drives off the road and Peter falls out of the car, and
  rolls down a cliff. Then rolls into a fat factory and a working whistle
  blows. Peter is in a vat of fat, and starts drinking, and the level of
  fat lowers, twice.>
  <Now in a hospital. Doctor and Peter, and Lois and the
  Kids>
  Doctor: "Well mister griffin the bandages are ready to come off, but I
  think I should tell you, it's a miracle that your alive at all, we did
  all we can, but medical science has come just so far."
  <Takes off the bandages, a horrific face is left.>
  Kids: (Gasp)
  Lois: "Oh, Peter you look like you!"
  Peter: "I can't believe your all standing by my side after what a jerk
  I was, especially to you! I'm sorry Chris."
  Chris: "That's okay dad!"
  Lois: "Well Peter I guess you learned a pretty valuable lesson."
  Peter: "Nope!"



Title: E. Peterbus Unum

It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  OK, OK. Here's another riddle. A woman has two children.
  A homicidal maniac tells her she can only keep one.
  Which one does she let him kill?
  That's... that's not a riddle, that's... that's just terrible.
  - Wrong! The ugly one! - Hey, Peter.
  Check out my new trampoline.
  Whee! Yeah! Whoa, momma! Whoo! Whoo! Yeah!
  Jeez, Cleveland, that must have set you back.
  What'd you do, sell your body to science? You know, I've thought of
  doin' that.
  All right, uh, Jenny, would you come up here and show us where the
  femur is?
  Aaah!
  Get out of here, you little bastard.
  I knew this was the right thing to do.
  No, I just got a big tax refund.
  Uncle Sam sent me $500.
  - I got 600 bucks. - I got 850.
  I got a rock.
  I spent my refund on a digital TV with surround sound.
  It's got headphones, so I can watch Steven Seagal movies without waking
  Bonnie.
  Yes! Lock and load! Lock and load! Bring on the pain!
  I spent my refund on a plug-in playmate.
  So, a schoolteacher? That must be interesting.
  Well, I'm gettin' somethin' special too.
  And by special, I don't mean special like that Kleinerman boy down the
  street.
  More special like... like Special K, the cereal.
  What did they do with the regular K?
  For that matter, what happened to Kaye Ballard?
  If you said "mallard" and you had a cold, it would sound like "Ballard".
  - Do you listen when you talk? - I drift in and out.
  You know, Rupert, the word "gullible" is not in the dictionary.
  Oh, oh, you don't believe me? Here! Look it up!
  What? What's that? It really isn't? Oh, Rupert, touché!
  Hoisted by my own petard!
  Ah, I am so alone.
  Everybody, my tax refund is here. I'm gonna buy us somethin' we've
  always wanted.
  - A cat? - A stereo?
  - A pool? - Oh, oh, I'm sorry. It is a pool.
  - Oh, joy unbounded! - I'll feed it and take care of it!
  Oh, my God! It's better than I thought.
  An Audi! I'm gettin' a car!
  Uh, Peter, there's a "T" in there. That says "audit".
  No, Brian, it's a foreign car. The "T" is silent.
  - Sweet! I'm gettin' an Audi! - I have an "inny".
  - Uh, Miss Stratford? - Come in, Mr Griffin. Don't be nervous.
  The IRS is much kinder and gentler than we used to be.
  - You smell nice. - What? Oh, that... that must be you.
  - No, it couldn't be me. I just farted. - Oh.
  I just have a few questions about your return.
  Did you incur any medical expenses this year?
  You can write off medical stuff? If I'd known, I wouldn't have used a
  discount surgeon.
  Uh, I'm not sure which one to cut here. The red one... or the blue
  one...
  OK, OK, just relax. Let's see, uh...
  First, why don't you attach that green one to that purple one?
  OK. Here goes.
  - Oh, God! - That kill me?
  - Uh-huh. - I was afraid of that. Try the green and blue.
  Well, Mr Griffin, you don't owe any additional money,
  but unfortunately, you're not entitled to a refund.
  - Aah! - Mr Griffin, are you OK?
  I'm sorry. I still haven't gotten over the loss of Party of Five.
  It'll take time to get over it. What were you sayin'?
  - You're not entitled to a refund. - Aah!
  - I'm sorry. Come again? - You're not entitled to a refund.
  - Aah! - Was that for Party of Five too?
  No, that was for my refund. What the hell's Party of Five?
  By God, I may not be able to give my family a vibrating sex doll,
  - But at least I can give 'em a pool. - Um... I say.
  If you find a human skeleton with a Lincoln Log jammed in the temple, I
  didn't do it.
  But I need that log for my recreation of James Madison's cabin.
  OK, kids, I don't want anyone swimmin' in this pool unless there's a
  lifeguard on duty.
  Ha, ha, ha! "Duty".
  Ha, ha, ha! "Diarrhoea"!
  - Hey, Lois! - What?
  Diarrhoea!
  Peter! I'm holdin' iced tea!
  Oh. Oh. You know, honey, you don't have to do this.
  Maybe a pool is another one of those things a family doesn't really
  need.
  Look, everybody. I got us another dog.
  - What the...? - Hi. You guys have any Cheese Doodles?
  See, that's what I do. I ask for a snack and I blow the horn.
  - Huh, look at this. Some kind of plastic root. - There's no such thing
  as a plastic root.
  You bastards come into our village and kill our fish, pollute our water.
  I'm gonna send you back to hell where you belong.
  Noooo!
  - Goodbye. - Ah, damn it.
  Aw.
  I've fixed the power line, but the town's zoning laws prohibit building
  a pool there.
  - What? It's my yard. - Sorry, Your house is too close to the kerb.
  Oh, yeah? Well, your eyes are too close to your nose.
  That may be. But you know what?
  I only have to wear one goggle when I go swimming in my pool!
  - Hey, wait, wait, wait! Come back here! - What?
  I have to draw you.
  You're why cavemen painted on walls.
  Damn government, telling me I can't build a pool on my own land.
  After my grandfather helped create one of our most beloved cartoon
  characters.
  OK. We've narrowed it down to two possible names. All in favour of
  "Bugs Bunny"?
  And all in favour of "Ephraim, the Retarded Rabbit"?
  Oh, you can all go to hell!
  - Hey, where's the mayor's office? - Last door on the left.
  - Come on! Come on! - Hello, is this the...
  Oh. Sorry. I thought you were the district attorney.
  No, I'm Peter Griffin. Oh, you're here about your pool.
  Step into my office.
  I'm here to serve the fine citizens of Quahog. It'll be my pleasure to
  give you a permit.
  - Well, it's about time. - Well, this is odd.
  - What? - I've never encountered anything like this,
  but your property doesn't seem to be on the map.
  It's not part of Quahog.
  What the hell are you talkin' about? I've lived there for 12 years.
  Sorry, but according to this map, you're not even part of these United
  States.
  Which would make you... a communist!
  - Ah! - Yeah!
  - Ow! - Damn! Usually my malcontents are skinnier.
  Would you come back in a week, when my fat malcontent trap door will be
  completed?
  I'm not comin' back in a week, or ever!
  I've had it with you and this damn government.
  Fine.
  I love this job more than I love taffy.
  And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy.
  Mmm.
  Ooh. Mmm.
  Oh. Hm.
  Hm. Mmm-mm.
  Mm. Oh, oh.
  Mmm.
  What's going on? Did the city give you the permit?
  No, no. We're not part of this city. We're not even part of this
  country.
  - And that makes us our own country. - What are you talking about?
  Thanks to a technicality, we have the right to secede from the US.
  From this day forth, this territory will be known as "Petoria"!
  I was going to call it "Peterland", but that gay bar by the airport
  took it.
  Our lead story tonight: Petoria.
  A new foreign country which was founded this week, here in our own back
  yard.
  And in a Quahog News 5 Exclusive, we sent our own little foreigner,
  Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, to Petoria,
  where first lady Lois Griffin has graciously agreed to give a tour of
  her country. Tricia.
  Thank you, Diane. So, Mrs Griffin, what's it like being the woman
  behind the man?
  Ah, you know, when Peter first said we were our own country, I was a
  bit sceptical.
  Then I thought "Hey! I could be like Hillary Clinton!" Only, you know,
  without the penis.
  Tell us a little bit about your country.
  Well, we're a clean and industrious people, mostly white.
  My son Chris is in charge of our space programme.
  We hope to get to the moon very shortly.
  Almost!
  Ow! They should really use monkeys for this.
  And little Stewie here is our President of Poopy.
  Oh, ha, ha, ha.
  So where is the president now?
  Oh, he's out on a goodwill mission to America.
  Here you go, Mr President. Mr President!
  Oh, Peter. That tickles me in a way that if Loretta tickled me in that
  way,
  I'd say "Oh, yeah! That's nice. That's the spot."
  What are you talkin' about? I'm a born leader. Like my
  great-great-uncle Ulysses S Griffin.
  Chug-a-lug! Chug-a-lug! Chug-a-lug! Chug-a-lug!
  - Yeah! Whoo! - How's that, Robert E Lee?
  All right. No more slaves. But we still don't have to read books.
  - Deal. - Yeah!
  Barkeep! Petro-nemo-slappy-wag.
  That's Petorian for "More beer, you slappy-wag."
  You still owe me for the other rounds, which comes to 50 bucks.
  I'm a foreign diplomat. I don't pay for drinks.
  You think G Gordon Liddy paid for his drinks
  while he was stranglin' people with piano wire for the good of our
  nation?
  Peter, you can't drink that outside. You're gonna end up in jail.
  Not a good jail, like on Cinemax. The man-jail.
  Go back and pay the bill, Peter. You, uh, don't wanna break the law.
  I can do whatever I want. Watch this.
  Oh, now you're just bein' crazy.
  Hey, that's against the law. You're comin' with me.
  Uh-uh-uh! Can't touch me.
  Can't touch me
  Ju-ju-ju-ju-just like the bad guy from Lethal Weapon 2
  I've got diplomatic immunity, so Hammer, you can't sue
  I can write graffiti, even jaywalk in the street
  I can riot, loot, not give a hoot, and touch your sister's teat
  Can't touch me
  - Can't touch me - What in God's name is he doing?
  - Can't touch me - I believe that's the "Worm".
  Stop! Peter time! I'm a big shot, there's no doubt
  Light a fire and pee it out
  Don't like it? Kiss my rump
  Just for a minute let's all do the bump
  Can't touch me
  Yeah, do the Peter Griffin bump
  Can't touch me
  I'm Presidential Peter, interns think I'm hot
  Don't care if you're handicapped, I'll still park in your spot
  I've been around the world, from Hartford to Bombay
  It's Peter, go Peter, up Peter, yo, Peter, let's see Regis rap this
  way, can't touch me
  Except for you. You can touch me.
  Attention, delegates. This session of the United Nations is hereby
  convened.
  Man, this sucks. Hey, Podium Guy! Hey, I got a problem here.
  - Excuse me. Some of us are here to learn. - No one's talkin' to you,
  Albania.
  - Is there a problem back there? - You bet your funny accent there is!
  I'm stuck up here in the nosebleeds. I'm president of Petoria. I want a
  better seat.
  Oh, of course. How could we not have recognised the great nation of
  Petoria?
  - Have a seat up front. - Well, that's more like it.
  And hey! Would you also like a special satellite
  to scratch your ass with a laser beam from space?
  They have those?
  Hi. How you doin'? You mind if I, uh...
  - They don't respect you. - What do you mean?
  I used to be the laughing stock around here until my country invaded
  Kuwait.
  Now I have a seat in the third row.
  The only way to get any respect around here
  is to find something you want and just take it.
  Wait. If everybody respects you, how come you're eatin' by yourself?
  - I don't shower. - Oh, that's what that is.
  Take what I want, huh?
  - Good morning, Joe. - Peter, what are you doin' in my pool?
  Oh, this is the newest province of Petoria. I call it "Johio".
  What? You can't just come over here and annexe my pool.
  Oh, yeah? Well, according to paragraph seven, sentence three, word eight
  of the Geneva Convention, "the".
  So tough luck, Swanson.
  - As you can see, Petoria has invaded US soil. - What are our options?
  A military strike against such a small nation could cause an
  international backlash.
  - But this kind of behaviour can't be tolerated. - Agreed.
  - I suggest we start with political sanctions. - Good, gentlemen.
  Well, I guess the world'll show me a little more respect now.
  Dad, I tried to got to school but this guy won't let me.
  - Oh, yeah? Him and what army? - The US Army.
  Oh, that's a good army.
  The scene outside the US-Petorian border
  as the sun rises on day one of Operation Desert Clam.
  Good morning. I'm Diane Simmons. We now go to Tom Tucker,
  live at the site of the US blockade. Tom?
  Diane, I'm here at the Petorian front, where the US has cut off
  electricity,
  water and gas to the tiny four-bedroom republic.
  The situation is very tense and extremely dangerous.
  It's only a matter of time...
  Oh, my God, they've opened fire. It looks like things are getting very
  heated here.
  This is not a safe place to be.
  And now sports.
  - Lois? - Over here. I'm chopping carrots for a salad.
  - Here. Use this head lamp. - Hey, where's the kids?
  Upstairs, doin' their homework by candlelight.
  Damn pig-dog Americans, messin' with my family like this.
  We can't bathe, we can't do laundry, there's no heat...
  We can't live like this for ever.
  It's not for ever. You know, it's just... it's just... You know.
  Peter, I'm up here. Oh, sweetie,
  maybe you should go over to Joe's and return his pool, huh?
  No. We're a real country. We deserve all the rights and privileges
  everyone else gets.
  But we have to think about the welfare of our children.
  - Stewie, is that you? - Lois, my mind's made up.
  I'm not givin' up an inch of Petorian soil.
  It's not a sign of weakness to compromise.
  I just think you should... Peter, stop starin' at my chest.
  Oh. Yeah, sorry, Lois.
  And we're back with our round-table discussion on the Petorian crisis.
  - Uh, you were making a point, John? - Yes.
  What the United States is doing to Petoria right now is criminal.
  Nonsense! Force is the only thing a despot like Peter Griffin
  understands.
  - Fine. Why not just drop a bomb on him? - What about that, Eleanor?
  Oh, it's ridiculous, clearly. He's a factory worker, not a despot.
  You're missin' the point. Our blockade is turnin' Petoria into a Third
  World country.
  Can anybody tell me what the square root of the hypotenuse is... Chris,
  is that a note?
  - No. - Yes, it is.
  Would you like to read it for the rest of the class?
  - No. - Just read it, lardo.
  - "I think Mrs Griffin's hot." - Go to your room.
  Damn you, Rupert! Keep these loathsome insects away, or you'll end up
  like Mr Giraffe.
  Hi. I'm Susan Sarandon.
  A lot of you know me as Tim Robbins' mother. But I'm actually his
  girlfriend.
  - And this is Stewie. - What the deuce?
  For less that the ticket price of one of my movies
  about capital punishment or neo-feminism,
  you can make sure that Stewie never goes hungry again.
  Yes, and from the look of those sweater cows, so can you.
  Morning, subjects. What's for breakfast?
  Nothing, you idiot. We don't have any food.
  Peter, this has gotten way out of hand.
  Look at what we're reduced to. Our own baby has to use newspapers for
  diapers.
  No, no. No, no, this is fine.
  One second. I'm just about finished with Family Circus.
  There we are. Who did that, Jeffie? Not me.
  My God, I haven't seen everyone this miserable since that time we were
  tortured.
  I'm sorry. Were you just whipping me? Or did I just get bit by a
  mosquito?
  Hey, Lois, if you happen to see the dungeon master,
  tell him his grandmother was tryin' to work me over.
  It's time to call this whole thing off. Nobody's on our side.
  Are you nuts? Look at all these telegrams.
"Nice goin'. Libya." "You the man! North Korea." "Great job! Iraq."
Iraq, Lois! You know what? I'm gonna invite a few of these fellas over
  for a party.
  See, Lois, I told you we had allies. Hey, Slobodan. You made it.
  I didn't know what to bring, so I made coleslaw. It's made out of
  people!
  - Just kidding. Is Muammar here? - Yeah, he's over there with Saddam.
  And then Jerry guessed that her name was "Mulva"!
  That show is so funny. It really reminds me of me and my friends,
  how we hang out before I kill them for worshipping the wrong god.
  And I love that Kramer guy. He comes in the room like this:
"Whaaaa..." Well, I can't do it, but you know.
- Marco. - Polo!
- Marco. - Polo!
- Fish out of water! - Aw!
Yeah, those are lookin' good. Yeah. Manuel!
Manuel, do you want... Can you ask him if he wants cheese?
Hey! Hey! Fidel! No running around the pool!
I say, I say, Achmed. What is that thing you people do
when you're about to assassinate an infidel?
Ah. You mean this?
Oh, yes, I love that.
Stewie! This is insanity.
- Whoa! Where do you think you're goin'? - America!
I've had enough. You can keep this filthy mess you call a country. Come
  on, kids.
  This is treason! For God's sake, Peter! Make an example of her!
  Nothing says "Obey me" like a bloody head on a fence post.
  Let's go! We're crossin' the border! Goodbye, President Griffin.
  - Brian, at least you're Ioyal enough to stay. - I've stuck by you
  through worse.
  Ah! Ah! Ah!
  Ah, I guess it's you and me against the world, buddy.
  Attention, President Griffin. As you may presently, yourself, fully be
  aware of,
  my grammar sucks, but more importantly, we're about to commence
  Operation Bomb the Crap Out of Your House.
  The guy who thinks up the names is on vacation. Fire!
  To answer your question, like that.
  The guy who aims is in the john. Ah, here he is. Next one's comin'
  right at you.
  Face it, it's over. Why not sit down with the mayor and negotiate some
  kind of treaty?
  Negotiate? Peter Griffin doesn't know the meaning of the word
  "negotiate".
  Can... can I tie you to a stick and use you as a white flag?
  Thank you all for coming. We invited Jesse Jackson
  to open our negotiations with a prayer.
  Ooh!
  Unfortunately, he couldn't make it, so in his place we have LaToya
  Jackson.
  Thanks. Um... Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub. Yeah, God!
  How very inappropriate. Thank you.
  Now, Mr Griffin, would you like to begin?
  OK. After much thought and consideration, I have decided to make a
  concession or two.
  - Very good, Peter. - First, I will return Joe's pool.
  - Oh, you got that right! - But I demand access to it on weekends.
  - No. - Accepted.
  I also demand to remain my own, independent nation.
  - Absolutely not. - How about you give me your pen?
  You mean this cheap little pen we have millions of back at the office?
  - Yeah. - No.
  Oh, man. So after all this I end up with nothin'?
  How about this? Every night when you get home from work,
  I'll scratch your back with a matchbook cover like you like.
  - Ah, Lois. - Aw.
  - Will you call me "Big Rudy" when you do? - No.
  And that's the story of Petoria, a little nation that, 200 years ago,
  seceded and repatriated in less than a week.
  - Any questions? - Yeah, uh, I don't get it.
  So, like, can the family understand the baby, or... or... What's the
  deal with that?

Title: The Story on Page One

We now return to "Sherry and the Anus".
  - Anus, are you still up? - Yeah, come on in, sis.
  Have you ever had to tell a lie in order to keep a friend?
  Well, the other day I told Jane her blouse was pretty when it was
  really pee-ew.
  Anus, I'm serious.
  Look, sometimes it's better to tell a little fib than to hurt someone's
  feelings.
  You're the best.
  Oh, that was good.
  Funnier than the one where Anus got the hamster stuck in his mouth.
  It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  Ah, the old alma mater. I tell you, there's something magical about
  Brown.
  Brown's the colour of poo!
  Yes. Yes, it is.
  Oh, I haven't been on a college campus in years.
  - Everything seems so different. - Really?
  If you laid on your back with your ankles behind your ears that would
  ring a bell.
  Excuse me. We're here to see the dean.
  Nobody sees the dean. Not nobody, not nohow.
  I'm sorry. Can I help you?
  Yes, this is Meg Griffin. She's here to see the dean of admissions
  and we'd, uh, like it if she got into the university.
  - Go on. Take it. - Wait over there.
  My days in college were so exciting.
  This one time the National Guard came and shot some of my friends.
  You must be the Griffins. Come in.
  Oops. Honey, you got a little smudge.
  Hey, you got something on your other cheek too.
  - And this is Pembroke Quad. - Oh, very nice. Very Brideshead Revisited.
  Being on this campus really brings back memories.
  Cowards!
  What ho? A veritable bevy of co-eds.
  Um... the recent campus sporting event was most disappointing for our
  side, wasn't it?
  Oh, aren't you adorable? Are you in a fraternity, little boy?
  Not yet, but I'm thinking about joining I Phelta Thi.
  Oh.
  So, what do you think of this "music television"?
  If I remember correctly, this is the physics department.
  That explains all the gravity.
  I say! It's like the spice rack in my fantasy kitchen!
  Hold on, little fella! This is just for big people.
  Why don't you come back in about 17 years?
  But the shelf life of that Sodium Pentothal is only two years and...
  Blast! This isn't the first time I've been thwarted by my small stature.
  OK, our next lot is number 15 in your programme.
  This is a one-of-a-kind item, a super-mega death ray.
  It's got the power to enslave the entire human race. Do we have an
  opening bid?
  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
  - Anything? - Ooh! Ooh!
  - We'll take any bid. - Here!
  It can enslave the human race. Come on. It's solid titanium.
  You! Here in the back!
  - Do I hear $100? $5? - Oh, come on.
  - Yeah! Ooh! - Free?
  - Enslave the human race. - Behind the fat chick!
  - Nope? - D'oh!
  OK.
  Ooh! Ooh!
  Argh!
  I'm tired of being small.
  I wish I was big.
  Blast!
  Well, let's take a look at your transcript.
"Meg." Hm.
That's not very impressive.
It's just three letters. It's hardly a name at all.
I never wanted to call her Meg.
I wanted to call her Twiki. But Lois said kids now wouldn't get the
  reference.
  You know what I'm talking about? Bidibidibidi.
  I'm not sure you're Brown material. Don't you have any extracurricular
  activities?
  Well, I'm president of the Luke Perry fan club, Quahog chapter.
  But I've wanted to go to Brown ever since I was a little girl.
  Well, actually, I really wanted to go to Wellesley
  but Mom said I might as well buy hiking boots and call myself a lesbian
  right now.
  Meg! Eat your salad.
  - We're not having dinner. - Then be quiet.
  I have no future! I'm just gonna wait in my room until I'm dead.
  - I'll be in shortly. - We've gotta do something.
  If Meg doesn't get into college, who knows what future she'll have?
  - You ain't getting this meat. This is my meat. - Shut up. I found this
  meat.
  I'm never gonna get into college.
  You just need more extracurricular activities.
  - You could get a part-time job. - I had one when I was in high school.
  - Oh! Argh! - Argh!
  That'll be $27.50.
  Come on. There's gotta be a hundred clubs at your school.
  Uh, well, I do have a friend on the school newspaper.
  Attagirl. And I got your first story right here.
  Lois, I challenge you to a race around the world.
  Go!
  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
  We need a picture for the front page.
  Hold on. I gotta rinse my retainer.
  I'm looking for something like the spread in last month's Vanity Fair.
  That was so sweet. It was wicked, awesome.
  Stop the presses! It's Meg!
  I'm just joshing. It's all done on Xerox. What can I do you?
  Look, Neil, I need an activity to get into Brown. The paper is my last
  hope.
  - Can I be a reporter? - I don't know, Meg.
  You never seem to be that interested in journalism-or journalists, such
  as myself.
  You know, I never realised how smooth the skin between your acne is.
  OK, I'll give you a shot. I've never been able to get an interview with
  the mayor.
  - You get it and I'll make you a reporter. - You got it.
  Run, little rabbit, run. But some day our two worlds will be one.
  I hope my face clears up by then.
  - Excuse me, Mayor? - How do you know my language?
  Listen to me. My entire future is in your hands.
  - Are you Sarah Connor? - No, I'm Meg Griffin. I need to interview you.
  - You're with the press? - Yes.
  Well, you can't interview a dead man... can you?
  - What about my interview? - Mayor West asked me to give you this.
  Uh-oh.
  Of course, you realise this means war.
  No.
  No, that's what they'll be expecting.
  Mayor West?
  Well, well, Mr Toilet. I thought you were in the Hamptons.
  No. No, no, it's me, Meg Griffin.
  I don't talk to the press under any circumstances.
  - What makes you think I'll talk now? - This.
  You just don't give up, do you?
  You seize life by the throat and shake it like a topless bartender
  mixing a martini.
  You've got your interview.
  - Thanks! - Hey! Hey! Listen to this.
  Do I sound like I'm on old-time radio?
  Mm! Oh!
  No more treats. You're gonna spoil your dinner.
  Oh, come on!
  Oh, damn my small stature.
  If I were big, oh, just think where I would be.
  Tired of not being able to find clothes that fit? I know I was.
  That's why I started Stewie's Big and Tall Man Shop. If you're portly
  or tall,
  you'll find a friendly atmosphere brimming with personalised and expert
  service.
  - Hey, Stewie, how's the weather up there? - Very fair... like our
  prices.
  Hey, dude. You want some of these?
  I say, here's the solution to my troubles.
  If I could build a device to harness the size of that leviathan,
  there's no limit to what I could... Oh, my God, there's an orgy in my
  mouth.
"Got milk?" That's a funny one too.
Oh, and, uh "I got ya, diagonally".
"Pretty sneaky, sis." That one's also funny.
Mayor West, you've been talking for an hour and I don't have anything I
  can use.
  - Can't you just please... - My God! Somebody's stealing my water.
  It just went down the drain.
  They're crafty, I tell you. It happens when you least expect it.
  Show yourself, damn you! I've been investigating him for months.
  It's cost $150,000 of the taxpayers' money
  but I'll find the culprits if it costs me a million.
  You spent public money investigating this?
  Thanks. You know, I think I have my story.
  Your story? Wait a minute!
  You can't print that! It'll compromise my entire investigation!
  Well, thank God she's just a figment of my imagination.
  Well, let's take the old boy out for a spin. Eyes open!
  Voice test: I'm Chris.
  - I'm Chris. - Eviscerate the proletariat.
  Eviscerate the proletariat!
  Puttin' on the Ritz!
  Not my bit, but still funny. System off.
  Splendid.
  - I did it! I got a great story. - So, what did your editor say?
  He was gone for the day so I left it on his desk.
  But here, I brought you a copy.
  Oh, my God. "Corruption in City Hall." This is amazing.
  Hey, let me see that.
  This'll never get Meg on the paper. This is old news.
  There have been political scandals since Thomas Jefferson.
  Oh, hold on. Honey, let's get all the kids in this.
  I know kids, and this story's gonna put 'em to sleep.
  Meg needs something that'll pull those kids away from their Rock 'Em
  Sock 'Em robots
  and their Spirographs and their Moby Grape and their 90210.
  Luke Perry. That's it! Brian, I got my story.
  Now, to get this story on the school editor's desk is gonna take a
  portion of my cunning.
  No! No.
  All my cunning.
  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh!
  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh!
  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh!
  Duh-duh-duh duh-luuh-luh-luuh-luh-luh!
  Duh!
  Duh-duh!
  Duh-duh!
  Duh-duh! Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah!
  Duh-duh!
  Duh-duh!
  Duh-duh-duh duh-luuh luh-luuh luh-luuh-luh!
  Dah!
  Duh-duh duh-duh-duh-daah!
  - Great story, Meg. - Oh, thanks!
  Way to go, Meg!
  Congratulations, Meg. This is the most sensational story we've ever had.
  Argh!
  - Luke! Time for dinner! - In a minute, babe.
  I'm just reading every high-school newspaper in America to see if I'm
  mentioned.
  Oh, my God!
  Meg Griffin, you are so sued.
  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duuh!
  Duddle-duddle-duddle-duddle-duddle-duh!
  - Luke Perry is suing us? - Dad, how could you do this to me?
  - I love Luke Perry. - Meg, you're wasting your time.
  - Don't you read the papers? He's gay. - You can't just print lies.
  - He has a wife and son. - So what?
  A lot of these famous types lead secret lives we don't know about. Like
  Ricky Martin.
  Ricky, we love you! We love you!
  - One minute to curtain, Jewel. - Jewel! Jewel!
  I just wanted you to have something to put on your transcript.
  Thanks to you I can put that I'm a big liar who makes up stories about
  people.
  It worked for Walter Cronkite... You know that Vietnam thing? Never
  happened.
  Don't mention it at the veterans' hospital. Those guys are committed to
  the lie.
  Aw, don't cry, sweetheart. I'll make it up to you.
  Remember the pony you wanted when you were six?
  Well, I bought him and I've been saving him for a time like this.
  Surprise!
  Oh. Oh, God. That's right. Ponies...
  Ponies like food, don't they? Oh, boy.
  Poor Meg. I know it sounds crazy but I can't help feeling like this is
  somehow my fault.
  No, it's Luke Perry's fault. If he were gay Meg would be all set.
  Brian, that's it! If I could get a picture of Luke Perry doing
  something gaylike
  it'll make people believe Meg's story is true!
  - Yeeh! - How the hell are you gonna do that?
  Hey, I've gotten people to believe crazier things.
"And if you are pure of heart and deed you'll all go to a beautiful
  place called Heaven."
  I'm yanking you. You just rot in the ground.
  All right, now walk up to the counter.
  That's it. Ring the bell.
  - Well, hi there. - Good day, shopkeep.
  Good day, shopkeep.
  I require a hand-operated buzz saw capable of cutting through a human
  sternum.
  - What? - It's for a school project.
  I'm some sort of student sent here for...
  Oh, blast! What the devil do they study? Uh... Latin class.
  Uh, sorry, kid. I can't sell power tools to minors.
  Look here, you gourd-bellied codpiece. Allow me to purchase the
  provisions I demand
  or I shall transform your blue collar into a red one and...
  Who the deuce are you? No, I don't have any spare change.
  Where the hell would I keep it? In my diaper? Get outta here, you hobo!
  Oh, bloody hell. Is this thing still on?
  All right, now, we gotta be very crafty so Luke Perry doesn't recognise
  us.
  Argh!
  How is he gonna recognise us? He doesn't know who we are.
  Oh. Huh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're right.
  Oh!
  - Sir, you look familiar. - Yeah, I'm that guy you wish you were.
  OK, as soon as I seduce him get ready to snap the picture.
  You're really gonna try and seduce Luke Perry?
  Listen, Brian, I'd take a bullet for Meg so I'm sure I can take a...
  Here he is.
  - Thirsty? - No.
  Gee, the sun seems really strong, even for my already-bronzed skin.
  Oh, my muscles are all... Look, they're all shiny with oil.
  But how am I ever gonna spread it on my rippling back and thighs?
  Ah, this is gonna take drastic measures. All right, get the camera
  ready. Oh, Luke!
  Mission accomplished, Peter.
  - We have a picture of Luke Perry vomiting. - That's no good.
  Gays don't vomit. They're a very clean people.
  They have been ever since they first came here from France.
  - Hi, honey. How was school? - Just great.
  I can't even say my name without people asking me if I made it up.
  - How could Dad do this to me? - Aw, honey, he wasn't doing it to you.
  He was doing it for you. He knows how much you want to go to Brown.
  There's no way I'm gonna get in now. I'm a felon.
  Now, that's not true. Libel's not a felony.
  It's a civil matter. Don't worry. Your father will straighten
  everything out.
  Come on. Let's go get our nails done. Chris, take care of Stewie.
  - Five Seasons hotel. - Hey there. You mind if I share a ride?
  - Uh, I don't think so, pal. - Oh, my God, I know you!
  You're Luke Perry! You were great in Rain Man.
  That scene where you wanted to get on the plane and that dumb guy was
  screaming.
  - Uh, that was Tom Cruise. - Not in this movie theatre it wasn't.
  Every time I see that lame-o actor I put your head on his body.
  Thanks. It's nice to meet someone who appreciates my work.
  Come to my house so I can take a picture of you in a gay pose.
  Huh?
  - Dinner? - Sure.
  Dark Side of the Moon synchs up with The Wizard of Oz.
  Really? Shannen Doherty told me that but I thought she was just being a
  bitch.
  Listen, I gotta get going.
  Oh, God! I'm sorry. You know what's good for getting wine out?
  - Sex with another man. - Whoa! Look, if you're gay, that's cool.
  But I am not. And even if I was... Come on, I'm Luke Perry.
  I can get a much better gay guy than you.
  Oh, my God! Luke Perry!
  See, Meg? I told you your father would explain about the article.
  Meg? Meg Griffin?
  - Uh, Peter, I think it's time for plan B. - Way ahead of you, Brian.
  Don't worry, I packed my own backup chute.
  Aw, crap.
  I should've figured you were up to something.
  This is all my fault. I was just trying to help my daughter get onto
  the school newspaper.
  You know what it's like to be a teenager.
  - You've been playing one for 30 years. - Won't you drop the lawsuit,
  please, Dylan?
  Ah, what the hell. But, hey, you gotta print the real story.
  And this time I wanna talk to the real reporter.
  - Let's go, Meg. - See, Meg?
  Things work out if you do whatever you want without worrying about the
  consequences.
  Thanks, Daddy. Come on, Luke. I got my computer in my room.
  Meg, keep your door open.
  I wanted to give you a copy of my daughter's article.
  - Listen, thanks for the... - Uh, Peter, I'm kind of busy.
  Oh! Uh, yeah. That's OK. Well, uh, thank...
  So, where were we?
  If I do this, do you promise to stop stealing my water?
  Uh, yeah. Whatever.

Title: Wasted Talent

It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  Hey, guys. Guys, check it out. Quagmire's tryin' to get lucky.
  Hey, gorgeous. You wanna come home with me?
  - I'm with my husband. - Lose the zero, get with the hero.
  A little violent for you, don't you think?
  Huh! I'll be right over there.
  We interrupt for breaking news. After years of isolation,
  the mysterious and eccentric brewmeister, Pawtucket Pat,
  has said that he's opening his never-before-seen brewery to a lucky few.
  Pawtucket Pat has placed four silver scrolls in four random beers.
  Each lucky scroll winner and a guest of their choice will take a
  magical tour of the brewery,
  and walk away with a lifetime's supply of beer.
  What? Don't complain. This is actually makin' you look attractive.
  Oh, man, did you guys hear that?
  Imagine seein' the inside of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery!
  - Forget it, Peter. You don't have a chance. - Yeah. You never win
  anything.
  Remember when you went on Password?
  This one is for Peter Griffin and Tony Randall.
  The password is...
  You...
  Actor.
  You...
  Tony?
  You...
  Very good, Jonas. Oh, my! Look at the time.
  Mrs Griffin, I practised just like you said.
  - Oh, far be it from me to call you a liar. - Huh?
  Nothing, nothing. See you next week.
  - Mom, how come all your students suck? - I don't know, honey.
  All I want is one pupil who's good enough to win the piano competition.
  I'm sick of comin' in second to that awful Alexis Radcliffe.
  Every year she wins and rubs it in my face.
  Don't worry, sweetheart. There's always next year.
  Congratulations on second place, Lois.
  Oh, Lois, thank God it's you. The last three houses I went to were very
  rude.
  - Have you been drinkin'? - Why, yes, I have. Thank you.
  I gotta find a silver scroll. Everyone's lookin'.
  All right, listen to me, you long-necked bastard.
  You give me the scroll, and I make you head of sanitation services for
  the entire city.
  It's a do-nothing job, sweetcake.
  Two more dead from alcohol poisoning. Hm.
  Lookin' for that scroll, huh? Wouldn't mind findin' that thing myself.
  Ah, jeez.
  Oh, man. I hope I don't get pulled over.
  OK, be cool. Maintain.
  C'mon, Death. You can do this.
  Why do you care so much about touring a stupid brewery?
  Everyone has their sanctuary. The Catholics have churches,
  fat people have Wisconsin, and I have the Pawtucket Brewery.
  Now help me drink these beers.
  - Peter, I'm not drinkin' this. - OK, OK. All right, all right.
  Lois, uh, I'm gonna go to the store now, OK?
  Here I go. Duh-duh-nuh-duh-duh-duh-nuh...
  Stop it! What if the kids were to see you drinkin' like this?
  Especially Stewie. He's so impressionable.
  Oh, my God! Please tell me we didn't do it.
  Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
  Huh. Nothin'.
  - Peter, it's seven in the mornin'. - Thanks for the update, Big Ben.
  - You're drunk again! - No, exhausted. I've been drinkin' all night.
  Peter, if you keep this up, somethin' terrible's gonna happen.
  Yeah, somethin' terrible... all the way to the bank!
  - Nice. - Oh, I don't have time for this.
  I'm late for my checkup.
  Wheeee! Whoo-hoo!
  Yeah! All right!
  - What's goin' on? - It seems Joe has found the first scroll.
  He's tastin' victory. I bet it tastes good.
  Like saltwater taffy or a Chunky.
  Oh, no! If there's four tickets and one of 'em's gone, that... that
  leaves...
  this many!
  Good morning, Mrs Griffin. Hello! Hello! Hello!
  Hello! Ha, ha! Just kidding.
  - So, uh, any problems? - No, everything's fine, Doctor.
  - Lois? - Oh. Hello, Alexis.
  Heard you might not enter the competition this year. Smart move.
  Yes, well, there are more important things in life than a piano
  competition.
  Oh, yes. Especially for those who have no-oh, that's cold! - Chance.
  For your information, I have a student that could whip you.
  Well, I guess I'll see you there. Fred, this is not a date!
  - All right, you're all done, Alexis. - What do you know?
  Once again, I finish first.
  Don't let her get to you. She asked for "Pine Forest". I gave her "New
  Car".
  Did you hear? It's over! Somebody found the last scroll!
  - Oh, my God! No! - It's true. The final scroll has been recovered.
  The recipient declines to be interviewed for safety reasons,
  but I'm sure you're all with me when I say "Congratulations, you son of
  a bitch."
  Oh, what am I gonna do now?
  - Hello, dumb-dumb. - Not now, Gazoo. I wanna be alone.
  It's not always about you, fatso.
  Maybe I wanted to talk.
  I guess wantin' it more than anyone just wasn't enough.
  Hey, you guys! It's a fake! There's still a scroll out there!
  That's right. I made it up. I figured if people thought the last scroll
  was found,
  everyone would stop looking, giving me the edge to find it myself.
  But what I did was wrong. And as an act of contrition,
  I will now insert this carnivorous earwig into my brain.
  Huh. Kinda tickles.
  Aaah!
  Oh God! It's eating out the back of my eyes! Aah!
  In other news, chocolate may be better for you than once thought. In a
  recent 12-day study...
  Ah, my last beer. Here goes.
  I bet that scroll makes the beer taste terrible.
  Oh, God.
  What the hell...?
  I've found it! I've found the last scroll!
  - He found it! - Oh, my God!
  Run home, Peter! Run as fast as you can!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Oh, man, this is the happiest day of my life.
  Now I know how Barbra Streisand felt the day she married James Brolin.
  - I love you. - I love you too.
  Oh! I'm so glad I married a regular person and not a celebrity.
  Professional ninja Jerry Nelson, how did you find your silver scroll?
  I was at home nursing this throwing-star wound, my wife Janey gives me
  a beer,
  and bam, there it was.
  Honey, I'm sorry. You know you can't sneak up on me.
  Ladies and gentlemen, in his first public appearance ever,
  Pawtucket Pat!
  That's for my brother Luis! He drank himself to death on your crappy
  beer!
  Gotcha!
  A big hand for Cheech Marin, everybody.
  Let the tour begin.
  - Hey, look! - Oh, those are the Chumbawambas.
  - They live here with me. - Hey, Pat. Where's the wheelchair ramp?
  Oh, we don't have one. I guess this is where you get off.
  Chumbawamba, gobbledy-goo
  Life isn't fair, it's sad but it's true
  Chumbawamba, gobbledy-gee
  When your poor legs are stiff as a tree
  What do you do when you're stuck in a chair
  Finding it hard to go up and down stairs?
  What do you think of the one you call God
  Isn't his absence slightly odd?
  Maybe he's forgotten you
  Chumbawamba, gobbledy-gorse
  Count yourself lucky you're not a horse
  They would turn you into dog food
  Or to Chumbawamba gobbledy-glue!
  I'm glad I'm not takin' your stupid tour! I'm a Coors man anyway!
  Silver Bullet!
  Gobbledy-glue!
  Very good, Jimmy.
  - Trying to watch the History Channel. - Try it again.
  Uh. Not talking to myself.
  You're good enough to tackle a Beethoven sonata!
  Let me grab the sheet music. Keep playing!
  I got the mu... Oh, my God!
  - Jimmy, what happened? - Yes, Jimmy. What happened?
  I... I fell.
  It's all behind this door.
  Lady and gentlemen, the beer room!
  Take a drink and you'll sink
  To a state of pure inebriation
  You'll be tanked
  Like the whole Irish nation
  Yeah!
  When you drink enough of my beer
  You will find this magic rule
  Make your every joke a jewel
  You'll drive drunker than Oksana Baiul
  Go on, buds, drink my suds
  Till you've reached that pure inebriation
  Though the beer may be free
  You're just renting it from me
  Ah. It's like I died and went to heaven.
  But then they realised it wasn't my time, and so they sent me back to a
  brewery.
  We're still working some of the bugs out of our latest invention,
  Permasuds.
  Beer that never goes flat. No matter how old it gets, it stays
  carbonated.
  Ooh! Aah!
  - Brian, wait. - Maybe we should stick with the group.
  Beer that never goes flat! Do you know what that means, Brian?
  This beer will still be carbonated long after you die of old age
  and we buy another dog to help the kids, you know, forget about you.
  - Peter, I wouldn't... - Wow! That's incredible.
  Ah, what the hell. Cheers! I don't know why he said it wasn't ready.
  - It tastes pretty good to me... Whoa! - Oh, my God! What the hell's
  happening?
  Must be the beer. Hey! Hey, check this out.
  And look at this!
  Oh, yeah? Watch this!
  - Oh, my God! - Relax, Brian, it's just a trick.
  - See, look, my thumb is fine. - I'm talking about that!
  Holy crap! There's nothing to grab onto!
  - Oh, this is it, pal. We're goners. - Peter, I've really cherished our
  friendship.
  Me too, buddy. That's why I was holdin' this in, but, if we're gonna
  die anyway...
  Peter, that's it!
  - Hey! Hey, pull my finger. - My pleasure.
  Hey, Peter, this next one you can blame on the dog.
  Ah! Silent but life-saving.
  What the hell is this? Didn't you see that sign?
  You've sullied my factory and disobeyed my rules.
  - I want you to leave immediately! - Oh, come on!
  - Don't I at least get a Chumbawamba song? - Oh, fine.
  Chumbawamba, gobble...
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Aah!
  Come on, Meg. The competition is this Sunday, and you're not even close
  to ready.
  - Maybe if you loosened my chains? - We tried that, remember, honey?
  - You can't be trusted. - Lois, take a letter.
"Dear Pawtucket Pat, I hate you! You are a bad man!"
"And you made me cry. Furthermore..."
  Not now, Peter. Meg and I are havin' a little girl time,
  - Help me! - Go on. No boys allowed.
  Jeez, Lois. Still with the piano? What's a guy gotta do to get a little
  attention around here?
  Peter, that's incredible! I don't understand how...
  You're like the idiot from Shine!
  Meg, you're free. Try the clarinet.
  Keep playin'. Keep playin'!
  No, no, no. Play it like you did last night.
  - I... I can't! - Peter, talent doesn't disappear just like that.
  Well, sometimes it does. I mean, you were pretty bad in bed Saturday
  night.
  Come on, Lois, move or somethin'! Jeez, it's like doin' it with a
  pillow.
  - Peter, I stayed at my mother's that night. - Oh.
  Oh, jeez, this hangover's killin' me. I haven't felt this crappy since
  I went to that museum.
  Why did all the dinosaurs die out?
  Because you touch yourself at night.
  Here, this'll make you feel better.
  Huh. I think we've found his muse.
  Oh, my God. You can only play the piano when you're drunk!
  That's not true. I can also vomit, fall down
  and make dirty calls to your sister when I'm drunk.
  Get a case of beer. We've got a lot of practising to do.
  - Practisin'? What for? - The competition.
  - You're gonna be my first champion. - Oh, play that sad walking-away
  song
  From The Incredible Hulk.
  Hey! Everyone! Look at me! Look, look! Look at me.
  Hey, thanks! You think that was great? Watch this!
  Uh-oh! Lois! I'm losin' my buzz!
  - I need more talent juice. - Another beer already?
  Oh, well, I guess I don't have to be prepared for the competition...
  I need another pitcher over here.
  Wow. Lois must've written the book on man-pleasin'.
  Too bad Loretta doesn't allow white literature in our household.
  Well, how much harm can one more pitcher do?
  - This is all for the sake of art, right? - Don't start with me, Brian.
  This may not be my proudest moment, but damn it, I wanna win.
  You're not the first person to do whatever it takes to win.
  You come to me and ask me to kill a man I do not know.
  Now I ask you, why should I kill this... Count Chocula?
  That son of a bitch has been spreading lies.
  My cereal does not cut the roof of your mouth!
  With all respect.
  I can't believe I'm missing Ronnie's party for this.
  That Ronnie's a bad influence.
  Yeah. That little bastard sold me some bad crack.
  Stay out of it, Herb. You're not even his real father.
  Yes, we're checking in. The student's name is Peter Griffin.
  - Oh, yes. He's on in an hour. - Where's the nearest liquor store?
  They're all closed on Sundays. This is a dry county.
  I can't do it without booze.
  Maybe this is a sign that we need to stop this.
  I've been keeping you ripped out of your head for my own selfish needs.
  I'm ashamed. Let's just go home.
  No, no, Lois, we can't stop now after all we've put into this.
  Yo, Fresh? How do I get to Ronnie's party?
  Oh, Peter, we're not goin' to a high-school party.
  - Lois. - Alexis.
  - Loser says "what". - What?
  Oh! I'll drive.
  Consume.
  - I love you so much. - This sucks.
  Well, you know, when I was your age, we had way better drinkin' games.
  - Ow. - Ha, ha! You drink.
  - It's the cops! - Run!
  Hold it, you two. Aren't you a little old to be drinking illegally?
  Uh... uh... Lois, look over there!
  Run!
  I wanna make you feel beautiful, Lois.
  Oh, Peter, stop. Try to stay focused.
  OK. You're on. Wait!
  Here's a little something for good luck.
  Make your trills clean and watch the legato in the fourth measure. Go!
  Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha!
  We did it, Brian!
  - Congratulations, Lois. - For what?
  Winnin' a trophy at the expense of my husband's health?
  Oh, God knows how many of his brain cells I killed,
  pourin' all that alcohol down his throat.
  Lois, you don't get it. The lesson here is that abusing alcohol
  has absolutely no negative consequences.
  You have the trophy and my brain cells are just fine.
  Hello? Where... where is everybody?
  I'm... I'm the only brain cell left!
  Well, at least I have my books.
  No! No, that... that's not fair.
  That's not fair! There was time now!
  That's not fair!

Title: Fore Father

(Scene: Exterior Shot of The Griffins house. Peter, Brian, Meg, and
  Chris are watching T.V).
  Unseen Announcer: We know return to Little House On the Prarie.
  (Exterior shot of Prarie house shown as we move inside to see a mother
  reading to two kids in the background and a girl reading Brail with a
  guy over her shoulder).
  Guy: Oh, that's wonderful Mary, you're doing great with your braille.
  Mary: (Putting book down on the table) I couldn't have done it without
  you Paul.
  Paul: (Gets out of chair) Why don't you go to bed and get some sleep,
  honey. (Paul walks ahead of her as Mary takes book and exits right.
  Paul mentions for the others to shush as he walks past Mary and uses
  his foot to move a wooden stool into her way of walking. She falls and
  trips over it).
  Paul: Honey, (Helps her up) you remember where the stool was. (he walks
  ahead of her as she continues walking in a diffrent direction. The two
  kids and mother are holding in laughter. Paul picks up a broom with a
  pan on the end attached to it and holds it in front of Mary. She walks
  into it and hurts her head). Oh Mary, Mary, you're in the kitchen
  sweetheart, you're all disoriented. Let me help you. (Spins her around
  as the mother and kids smile) The ladder's right here. (Mother and kids
  hold in laughter again).
  Mary: (Heading up ladder) Thanks Paul. (He kisses her as she walks up
  the ladder, which he moves over to the window at the top of the barn.
  She falls out the window and crashes into something outside. The others
  are laughing at her. Cut back to Peter and family).
  Peter: (Fairly serious) Geez, life was a lot tougher back then.
  Theme Song
  (Same shot of Peter, Brian, Meg and Chris on the couch as Lois enters
  carrying in Stewie).
  Lois: Listen up everybody. It's time for spring cleaning.
  Peter, Brian, Meg and Chris: (At the same time) Spring Cleaning!? Oh
  not again! (Notices they're all talking in unison) That was weird. Boy,
  that was weird too.
  Lois: If we all pitch in we'll be done in no time.
  Peter: Lois, you known I swore I'd never clean again. Not after Boundy
  dropped me as their spokesman (Flashback to Peter in a yellow painted
  kitchen, dropping liquid on a table counter while a woman holds up the
  Bounty product). Wait a second, Rosie, I've just pourn this glass of
  warm yellow liquid on the counter and you're telling me that Bounty can
  pick it up in 5 seconds?
  Rosie: (Notices liquid) What is this?
  Peter: (Looks at watch) Four seconds.
  Rosie: Is that-
  Peter: Three seconds.
  Rosie: It smells like-
  Peter: (Points to liquid) Clean my pee! (Flash back to the Griffin's
  house. Meg sits up on the floor).
  Meg: Mom, I can't clean, I've got stuff to do.
  Lois: Sweetheart, we know you don't have any stuff to do. (Moves on
  hand palm side up in the air) Now I don't want to hear any more excuses
  from anyone.
  Peter, Brian, Meg, Chris: (In unison again) Ah crap. (Notices they're
  in unsion again) We did it again! (Wait a few seconds and look at each
  other) Ruth Bader-Ginsberg! (Eyes squinch up) Ooooohhhh!
  (Exterior shot of the Griffins house, then a shot of Meg and Lois
  cleaning in the basement by dusting off boxes (Meg) and a shelf of
  various equipment (Lois). Lois moves over to a chest near the shelf and
  opens it).
  Lois: Ahh, look Meg, it's your little baby booties (pulls them out of
  chest), oh and your little bronze hat (pulls that out of chest as well)
  and your tail (pulls tail out. Meg's eyes go wide).
  Meg: My What!? (Turns around to Lois)
  Lois: Nothing. (Puts tail back in chest and shuts it. Shot of Peter,
  Chris and Cleavland near a fire hydrant. Chris is holding a wrench and
  standing next to Cleveland and Peter is holding a piece of paper out).
  Peter: Okay, Lois's list says clean the windows, clear the gutters, and
  wash the siding (Moves hands to waist) Now for most folks (moves his
  right hand up) that's three chores (points at guys) but to Peter
  Griffin and his big hose it's one. (attaches a hose that was previously
  off camera to the hydrant)
  Cleveland: Oh, you're not working hard Peter. (Peter moves with the
  hose right in front of the hydrant preparing to turn it on) You're
  working (?) smart. (Moves to the street pavement right before the
  sidewalk in front of his house and calls back).
  Peter: Hey Chris, give me the juice. (Chris uses wrench to turn screw
  on hydrant around. A gush of water comes out of the hose which Peter
  moves to the top window of his house. The water breaks the window and
  Peter moves the hose right knocking some of the covering on his house.
  Shot of Brian using a vaccum to clean another room. He moves on top of
  a table, which is immediatly blasted by the gush of water. Brian is
  knocked off camera. You can now see Peter still spraying the water with
  his hose outside as Chris turns the water off by turning the wrench the
  other way. The water steadily dies down and Peter starts smiling).
  Lois: (From inside the house calling out a broken window) Peter there's
  water and glass and it's a diaster in here.
  Peter: (Still holding hose) Well Lois, why don't you put down your
  ginger ale and redbook and get to work? (Looks at her sternly) La-zy.
  (Walks off screen to the left).
  Lois: You're not helping. Look, don't come near the house. Go do
  something else (Walks out off camera. Shot of Joe and his son Kevin
  near their truck. Joe moves his finger to a bag on the driveway).
  Joe: Son, this duffel bag is only half zipped. (Kevin moves to zip it
  as Peter, Cleveland and Chris walk on screen).
  Peter: Hey Joe, where you going?
  Joe: I'm going camping for the weekend (points to Kevin still zipping
  up bag) with Johnny Cut corners . (Stops pointing) You guys wanna come
  along?
  Cleveland: Hmm, it would be nice to get out of the house. This is the
  time of the month when Loretta is visited by her Aunt Flo. Loretta
  likes to personify her mencies in humorous ways. (Shot of Quagmire
  outside of his house looking at his mail near the mailbox).
  Joe: (Calling out to him) Hey Quagmire, you up for some camping?
  (Quagmire's head turns to them and he smiles). Quagmire: Heh, sorry
  bud. (moves right hand with the mail in it to his side and the other
  one on his chest) The only tent I'm pitchin' this weekend is... (smile
  dissapears and he looks uneasy) Well, you see where I'm going with
  this. (Moves his arms in a fluid downward motion) Oh!
  Chris: (Looking at Peter) I want to go to Dad. (Looks kind of scared)
  It will get me away from the evil monkey that lives in my closet.
  (Cleveland and Peter start laughing at him).
  Peter: (still laughing) Monkey in the closet… (goes back to
  laughing with Cleveland as Chris looks worried. Pan to outside his room
  where a scary looking monkey comes near the window and points at him
  menacingly and jumps off the window pedestal. Chris looks down
  depressed. Peter is talking to Joe and Cleveland)
  Peter: Oh, this is going to be great. Last time I did any male bonding
  is when me and Cleveland (points to him) went to China Town. (Flashback
  to Chinatown where a store sign says Chinese Finger Cuffs and then pans
  down to Peter and Cleveland stuck by finger cuffs by their... penises.
  The store manager looks at them).
  Peter: Look (looks at him) forget how it happened, can you just get us
  out of this?
  (Shot of inside house where various papers and books are all torn apart
  in the kitchen. Stewie is seen drinking some tea with Rupert in the
  background along with some cookies, which he puts into some paste and
  then eats them).
  Stewie: I say, Rupert, (looks at him) this paste is quite delicious.
  It's almost worth the bowel obstruction. (Licks finger and puts down
  paste bottle. Brian enters the room through a door on the left and
  looks angrily around the room and then at Stewie).
  Brian: (Questionly) Are those my books? What the Hell are you doing?
  Stewie: Paper machíe. (tears out one of the papers) I use
  them to make the houseboat from Surfside 6. (pan to a repiclia of said
  house boat) You remember: (starts to sing and move his hands back and
  forth) Surfside 6! (high pitched voice with finger to his mouth) Who
  lives there? (regular voice and hands moving again) Surfside 6! (High
  pitched voice and finger to mouth again) Young bachelors? (Normal voice
  and hands moving back and forth again) In Miami Beach! (Spreads his
  hands and arms open horizontally and tilts head upward. Brian points at
  him).
  Brian: (Angry) Those are my first editions (Lois enters the room) You
  little punk! (Brian moves to him and Stewie moves toward Lois who picks
  him up).
  Stewie: Momma, doggie's scary!
  Lois: Brian, have you lost you're mind? He's just a baby. (pats Stewie
  and turns right) He doesn't know what he's doing (walks off with Stewie
  who looks at Brian).
  Brian: This isn't over.
  Stewie: (Smug) Oh, if you're looking for your doschodoectie I used it
  used it to make the Fort from F troop. (Lois contiunes to walk into
  living room with Stewie and looks at him)
  Lois: Look what I found, Stewie. (holds up letter) An appoinment card.
  (puts him down on sofa) You've got a checkup. (Stewie holds the card
  and looks at it)
  Stewie: Oh, marvelous. A quick weighing (points out) a stick in your
  tounge and a nice lollypop to cap it all off. (folds letter a bit and
  looks at Lois) Oh, and remind me to ask the doctor when my other
  testicle is going to descend. (Shot of the woods as we pan to Peter Joe
  and Cleveland. Joe and Cleveland are pitching a tent to the ground and
  Peter's drinking a beer and sitting on a tree stump. Cleveland Junior
  comes in with a stick).
  Cleveland Junior: Bang! (Points at Peter) I'm Daniel Boon! I'm a man
  (Jumps up and down) I'm a big man! (Points stick in other direction)
  Bang Bang! (Breaks stick in two and looks at it. Drops one half of the
  stick in his right and and twirls the stick in his left hand). Now I'm
  Pat Boone. Gonna have a Christmas special with Daniel Willams. (Laughs
  and runs around in a circle once and then offscreen)
  Peter: (Breaths in air and exhales) Ah, so beautiful. It's almost as if
  this world was created espically for me. (Pan to a T.V monitor with him
  on it with two monitors to the side and the sign A-10112 on top. A hand
  is touching the monitor with Peter on it as it slowly moves off, and
  shows two guys, one with a beard and one with a hat. Both of them have
  microphone head speakers on).
  Beard Guy: You think he's on to us Christov?
  Christov: (Now shown with the moon behind them) No, he's an idiot.
  (Shot of Kevin walking back to camp holding a shovel).
  Kevin: Dad, I dug the latrine 50 feet out.
  Joe: (Not impressed) Oh, that's great Kevin, you want a cookie every
  time you do something right? Get some firewood.
  Kevin: (makes army salute to Joe) Yes sir! (Walks off camera. Joe turns
  to Peter smiling).
  Joe: He's gonna grow up to be quite a man. (Flashforward to Kevin grown
  up with some attractive blonde woman in bed with him. Women is looking
  quite pleased while Kevin is looking fairly bored).
  Women: (Looks up at him) Mmmm, that was incredible Kevin.
  Kevin: (Looks at her) I'm not here to impress you. (Women starts to
  look sad as we pan over to Joe looking at them) Am I dad?
  Joe: Did I say you could rest yet!? (Flash back to present as Peter and
  Joe look slightly up smiling. Cleveland Junior runs up with some
  firewood in both hands).
  Cleveland Junior: I'm Abe Lincoln. I just chopped some wood. (laughs
  and wood falls to the floor).
  Joe: (Sternly looks at him) Good for you son. (Cleveland Junior walks
  off camera and Joe looks at Peter) Hey, where's Chris? I asked him to
  fill the canteens an hour ago.
  Chris: (Off camera) Hey dad, look. (Peter and Chris turn to see Chris
  moving on camera, shirtless and lying on his back) I covered my back
  with honey and now the ants are taking me home. (laughs as ants drag
  him off camera).
  Peter: (Laughs as well and points at Chris) He does the same thing at
  home with Velveeta and cockroaches. If you turn the light on really
  fast (Peter raises left hand and moves it over quickly) they slam him
  right into the fridge. (Shot of outside Dr's Office. The name on the
  door says Elmer Hartman on it. We see Lois putting down Stewie on one
  of the waiting room seats, and then sitting down herself. Stewie eyes a
  magazine to the right of him and picks it up).
  Stewie: Oh great, Miera Bella. (Pauses and looks at it again)
  December's Miera Bella. (Tosses the magazine back on the table it was
  on. Looks at another baby and parent to the left of the magazine. The
  baby is naked). What's you're story? Get lost on the way to the mourge?
  Heh, no seriously is that yours? If it is, then bravo. (Shot of Peter,
  Joe, Cleveland, and Cleveland junior. Peter is holding a tackle box
  while Cleveland Junior is looking at his dad and Joe is holding a
  fishing pole).
  Cleveland: You remember that short lived sitcom, Fish? (Joe puts away
  the fishing pole in his backpack) They should have put that on before
  Chips. (The four move out of camera and walk to the river where Chris
  is sitting on a log with a pencil and paper in his hand) The marketing
  pratically writes itself.
  Joe: (Looking at Chris) Let's go Chris. You're dinner isn't going to
  catch itself.
  Chris: I don't wanna go (continues drawing) I had a bad experience with
  a fish once .(Flashback to Chris's room. Just as he enters it he looks
  to his fish bowl and see's his fish is gone. He looks under the
  fishfood and see's a watertrail, that goes all the way to the window,
  which is partily broken) Oh my god, my fish is gone! (Looks to his
  piggybank and see's nothing there as well) And he robbed me!
  (Flashforward to the present)
  Peter: Okay, see you Chris.
  Joe: Peter, this is none of my business, but you're turning you're boy
  into a slacker.
  Peter: How dare you call my parenting into questioning! If you were a
  woman I'd slug you.
  Joe: I'm just saying you should teach him some responsibility.
  Peter: Alright. (Looks over at Chris) Hey Chris, you are responsible
  (walks over to him) for guarding the camp while were fishing.
  Chris: Got it dad. You can count on me to- (falls asleep in mid
  sentence).
  Peter: (Looks at others and then taps Chris to wake him up) Chris, pay
  attention. I want you to (also falls asleep mid sentence, and so does
  Chris again. Shot of Doctor Hunter's office where Stewie has stripped
  naked and Dr. Hunter is examining Stewie with his stethoscope).
  Dr. Hunter: Alright, take a deep breath Stewie. (Moves strethroscope to
  Stewie's stomach. Stewie laughs and pushes it away).
  Stewie: Cold! Cold! (Stops laughing) Okay, okay, I'm fine, I'm fine.
  (Dr Hunter puts strethropscope back on Stewie's stomach. Stewie breaths
  through his nose once and looks at the doctor) Ah! Tell me Dr Hartman
  do all the children fall in love with you? (Dr. Hunter looks at him and
  Stewie starts laughing again) That's cold, that's cold. (Dr. Hunter
  picks him up and puts him on the scale).
  Dr.Hunter: Hmmm, 29 pounds. (takes out pen and writes something down)
  That's big for your age.
  Stewie: (Looks at him sternly) Well, forgive me for not being one of
  those aneroxic babies from the diaper commericals. (Dr Hunter picks him
  up and puts him back on the table as the nurse comes in carting a metal
  rolling table with a package of wooden tounge depressors on it).
  Dr Hunter: Alright little guy, time for you're immunizations.
  Nurse: (Talking to Lois) You might want to hold him.
  Stewie: (Looks at Lois) Hold me for what? (Looks shocked as the nurse
  hands the Doctor a needle. Lois comes over and touches his arms) What
  the deuce?
  Lois: (Looks at him) Oh, I'm sorry sweetie. (Stewie struggles out of
  her grip and runs on the table the nurse brought in, takes one of the
  tounge depressors and holds her by the neck with the tounger depressor
  in a sliting throat position).
  Stewie: Back off! Don't come any closer or I'll cut her! (Looks at the
  tounge depressor he's holding) I'll... I'll... give her a series of
  splinters... that could um... you know... become infected! (Lois walks
  up holding a blue kitty puppet in her left hand).
  Lois: Look Stewie, look at the dancing kitty. (Continue to walk towards
  Stewie).
  Stewie: Oh ho ho, no I'll not be taken in by one of your (Lois stops
  walking. Stewie's attitude changes and he becomes content with the
  kitty) Oh my, that's delighful, isn't it, what's your name, (Dr. Hunter
  sneaks up behind Stewie with the needle) you little- (sticks him with
  it) Ahh! Ahh God! (Shot of the sun in the sky setting as we pan down to
  see Peter, Joe, and Kevin. Peter is drinking in one boat and Joe and
  Kevin are in another).
  Peter: (Looking outward) They call this the magic hour. The day's not
  quite gone, but the night's not quite here, and somewhere Scott Baio is
  plowing a woman he dosen't love. (Kevin's line begins to snag and he
  pulls on it).
  Kevin: I got one, dad! (Pulls line up fully and we see the fish has
  escaped).
  Peter: (Chuckles a bit) Heh heh, looks like that's the one that got
  away.
  Joe: (Pulls out a gun) The hell it is. (Holds gun out and looks at
  Kevin). You get in there (hands gun to Kevin) and kick that fish's ass!
  (Kevin get's up and jumps out of the boat. Joe crosses his arm and
  looks down at the water. Then aside he says) God, I love him. (Shot of
  Cleveland Junior running by, along with Joe being wheeled by Kevin and
  Cleveland and Peter).
  Cleveland: I can't believe how terrible the fishing was.
  Peter: Yeah all we got was this tire, a boot, a tin can and this book
  of cliches (holds up book).
  Joe: Well, thank God we came prepared. We brought enough food to last
  us- (The guys reach camp and are shocked to see it a total mess with
  the food being taken out of the cooler. Chris is standing next to the
  turned down cooler on the right and Cleveland Junior on the left).
  Peter: Holy crap! (Raises arms slightly up) Chris what the hell!? I put
  you in charge of the food.
  Chris: (Runs over to Peter with sketchbook) The raccoons were here
  (opens up book and we see a drawing of the food) see? (In flipbook
  fashion, Chris turns the pages as drawn raccoons appear in the book)
  Oh, we're a bunch of sneaky little animals. (drawn raccons knock over
  food) We're going to wreck this food and eat it (do so) because we're
  naughty (raccoons surround the tent. Chris comes out) And then there's
  a guy. Let's get him in trouble with his dad. (Chris laughs as drawn
  Chris says look at the raccoons)
  Joe: Somehow I'm less then surprised.
  Chris: (Looks down at ground) I'm sorry dad. I messed up the entire
  trip.
  Peter: Ah it's not you're fault Chris. I failed you as a father. From
  now on Joe will be you're father. (Joe shakes his head no) Cleveland?
  (Cleveland also shakes his head no. We pan to a elk on the right).
  Elk: I'll teach the boy. Come my son, I'll show you the ways of the
  herd- (sound of gunfire heard as a hunter shoots the elk and him and
  his two buddies carry him offscreen)
  Peter: (Looks at dead elk, then looks at ground) Ah crap.
  (Scene: At the Griffin's house at night, Peter and Lois's bed. We see
  some form in the bed as Lois enters in her nightgown and robe)
  Lois: Peter, why are you sitting with the sheets over you're
  head?(pulls off sheets to reveal a collection of skeleton heads. Lois
  screams and Peter enters from the left) Peter, what's wrong?
  Peter: (Looks at her) Is it that obvious?
  Lois: (Takes one of the skulls and puts it in the closest) Well you
  always do the skull gag when you're depressed. (picks up another one
  and holds it) Talk to me.
  Peter: Well, it's just I'm trying to teach Chris how to be a man, you
  know. First I tried teaching him how to eat an oreo. (Holds his hand
  out. We flashback to Chris and Peter in the kitchen with a plate full
  of oreos between them).
  Peter: (picks up an oreo) The way to eat an oreo is to twist it (twists
  the oreo) pull it apart (does so) and lick it (licks the left half of
  the oreo once). Now you. (Chris picks up the oreo and smacks it against
  his head, falling unconcious. Flash to the present again where Peter is
  sitting on the bed) Then I'd try teaching him how to get out of paying
  a check.
  (Flashback to Peter and Chris at a resturant. Peter is drinking soup
  with a spoon and brings it up to his lips and drinks, then looks back
  and forth and pulls out a naked dead person from underneath the table
  and puts his head into the soup. He points to the waiter) Uh, waiter?
  (He motions for the waiter to come over, which he does) There's a dead
  guy in my soup.
  Waiter: Oh, I'm terrribly sorry sir. Of course you're soup is grathus.
  (Waiter walks out off camera. Pan over to Chris on the other side).
  Peter looks at him).
  Peter: Now your turn. (Chris takes a seemingly naked dead guy from
  under the table and places his face on the soup. Chris points to the
  waiter).
  Chris: Waiter, there's a dead guy in my-(the seemingly dead guy moves
  his face out the soup and is looking around afraid. He starts
  screaming. Chris takes the wine bottle and keeps bopping the guy over
  the head with it. Peter looks shocked and crawls off camera to the
  right. Flash back to the present where Peter is standing up and Lois is
  siting on the bed)
  Lois: Peter, you can't force feed maturity. He needs to learn it on his
  own. (Gets up and takes off her night robe) Why don't you get her a job
  or something?
  Peter: Woah! (Lois throws the robe to the bed) Freeze Frame! (Lois is
  frozen in her position and Peter shrugs his shoulders slightly) That's
  it! (Walks to where the camera would be if this were live action) I can
  teach Chris responsibility by getting him a job. (Points to Lois) Isn't
  she great? (Walks back to her) Now you see why I married her. (Faces
  back towards the camera and makes the leave motion with his right
  hand). Go away now. I'm gonna do stuff to her. (Exterior shot of
  Griffin's house at morning time. Brian is sitting on the couch and Lois
  enter's the shot from the right carrying three books).
  Lois: I'm sorry Stewie ruined your books. Here, (puts the books down
  and sits on armrest) I brought you some of Peter's. (Brian takes the
  first book and looks at the title). Brian: (Reading) Mr. T by Mr. T
  (puts that book to the left and picks up next book and reads title). T
  and Me by George Prepard. (Puts that book to pile on the left and picks
  up the last book and reads the title). For The Last Time, I'm not Mr. T
  by Bing Rayems. (Clenches fist and shudders. Stewie is now seen in
  front of the couch looking wobbly and tired).
  Lois: (Get's up) Oh Stewie are you ok? (Walks over to him).
  Stewie: Must we make small talk everytime we pass? (Lois feels his
  forehead)
  Lois: Ooh, you're burning up. Must be a reaction to the shots. I'll get
  you some baby asprin (walks off camera).
  Stewie: (Get's up and looks in the direction she was walking in). What
  the devil are you talking about? You said the shots were suppose to
  make me healthly. (Brian looks over, smiles, and begins to laugh).
  Brian: (Points to him) You actually believe Lois had them inject you
  with something to make you healthy? I, I mean you were already healthy
  right?
  Stewie: Oh god, you're right! I was as pink as a pistol! (Brings hands
  toward mouth and realizes what he just said) Pink as a pistol? (Moves
  hands down) Good Lord, I can't even form a cojent (?) (moves hands to
  face) simile anymore! (Turns to Brian) What was in those needles?
  Brian: I've already said too much. (Jumps off couch and walks over to
  Stewie, then past him off camera as we pan to Stewie)
  Stewie: I should have known. Her treachery knows no limits (takes a
  step forward) I... I …(begns to stumble while he's walking)
  Getting dizzy… (stumbles a bit more, brings his head up)
  Fight it, Stewie… (brings it down. He brings his hand up
  shaking). You'll not go gentle in that good night… (tilts
  head forward again and raises hand up) to quote Bob Dylan. (falls down
  backwards and we pause here. He quickly sits up for a second). No, no
  Dylan Thomas. (and falls back down. Shot of Quahog golf club driving
  range as we move to the hitting area and Peter, Joe, Kevin and
  Cleveland enter).
  Peter: Boys, I'm a miracle worker. I have used all my parenting skills
  to change my son from a lazy slacker (points to him on the field
  picking up balls) to a working man. (Chris gets hit quickly by a lot of
  balls).
  Joe: Nice going, Peter.
  Peter: Yeah, up yours Joe.
  Joe: What?
  Peter: Thanks. (Waves to Chris) Hey Chris!
  Chris: (Waves back) Hey dad! I'm working, I'm workin- (gets hit by
  golfball right in the chin) ow! (Holds his chin)
  Peter: (holds left hand cupped to face) Careful Chris, you don't get
  Dental for 60 days. ( A short man with acne comes on screen).
  Short Man: (Points to Peter) You that Griffin's boy's father? (uses
  hand to point to himself) I'm Patty Tanager, the Caddy Manager. Yeah,
  it rhymes, big woop, wanna fight about it? Listen (extends arms a bit)
  you're son is the best ball shaggle we ever had. I sold twice as many
  buckets today because everybody wants to hit the fat kid. (Pan over to
  a business guy in a red coat talking to someone on his cell phone).
  Business Guy: Lyn, cancel my afternoon meetings. I-I gotta hit more
  balls at this fat kid. (Pan over to the guys as Joe looks to Peter).
  Joe: Peter, you mind if Kevin and I uh-
  Peter: Nailed Chris? He'd be thrilled. (Pan over to Cleveland Junior,
  who is on one of the shooting areas and hits a golf ball pretty far.)
  'Tanager: Hey, (points to Junior) this kid here just knocked the ball
  300 yards! (people are crowding around Junior as he hits another one
  far. The people applaud and he jumps up and down)
  Cleveland Junior: I'm Tiger Woods! I'm Tiger Woods! Whee! (Hits another
  ball pretty far. Pan back to Peter and Tanager).
  Peter: Geez Cleveland, your kid's a natural. With a little help he
  could be a pro.
  Cleveland: Oh Peter, I can't make Cleveland Junior sit still for
  anything. Sometimes (pulls his hands out) I wonder if he's got the
  ephiylepsly. But then I go and see what's on the T.V.
  Peter: Well, maybe you're not a good a father as me, heh? I mean,
  (points backwards) look at what I did with Chris. I'm even better then
  that dad on Lost in Space. (Flashback to Lost in Space set. Dad, kid
  robot, couple and girl and mother figure are seen in a rocky alien
  terrain).
  LOS Dad: We need to gather more information (walks away a bit and stops
  and but his hands on his hips) on this new planet. (Walks over to
  couple) Don, you take my 16 year old blonde daughter out in the chariot
  for the rest of the day. (walks over to the two other females) Penny,
  you stay here with me. (Walks over to boy and robot). And Will, you and
  the robot go out into the uncharted wilderness and take this mincing
  (pan out to reveal older man standing next to robot) boy hungry
  pedophile with you. (Flash back to present).
  Cleveland: Cleveland Junior is beyond your skills. He won't respond to
  you.
  Peter: Oh yeah? (motions to Cleveland Junior) Hey, hey, come here
  Cleveland Junior, hey, come to Peter. Cleveland: (also motions to
  Junior) Over here Cleveland Junior. (at the same time) come on come
  over here come to papa! (Junior walks over to Peter)
  Peter: Huh huh? Come on you'll see. I'm gonna turn this kid into the
  greatest golfer ever.
  Cleveland: Fine. (Walks off screen)
  Tanager: How'd you get him to come to you?
  Peter: (Holds up bottle) With this.
  Tanager. Oh. (Him and peter look half eyed away, voice with emotion)
  Peter: Love.
  Tanager: Jealousy.
  Peter: Touch.
  Tanager: Forever.
  Peter: Intense.
  Tanager: Passion.
  Both: (Whispering it) Obessison. Calven Klien. (Exterior shot of
  Griffin's house. We have a shot of Stewie in his bed, Lois looking
  worried standing next to him, and Brian reading a book on a chair on
  the left of Stewie's crib).
  Lois: (Hands him cup of water) Drink this honey, it will bring your
  fever down. (He drinks a bit of it). I'm going to run you a cool bath.
  (walks off screen. Stewie waits until she's out of his line of vision
  and spits out the water).
  Stewie: She's one of them, I'm sure of it. (Turns to Brian) Now tell me
  what they injected me with. (Brian is still reading book without
  looking up).
  Brian: Huh, did you know Mr T. always wanted to be a broadway dancer?
  Stewie: (curls fist up and puts them in the air) Answer me damn it!
  (Looks at him again) What have they done to me? (Brian looks away from
  the book and at Stewie).
  Brian: Look (Get's off chair and holds book to the side) it could be
  any number of things. Gene manipulation, sterizillation. (Stewie is
  shocked)
  Stewie: Not my seed!
  Brian: (Looks at him closely) But from the look on you're pupils, I'd
  say it's some kind of mind control syrum. (pauses for a second then
  walks away smiling). Or not. (Stewie goes to the mirror in his crib and
  looks at himself).
  Stewie: Mind Control? (Looks away) But I feel so lucive. (Mirror Stewie
  looks at him).
  Mirror Stewie: Yes, you look spot on to me.
  Stewie: Oh, why thank you. I try to work out.
  Mirror Stewie: Oh, but who has the time (makes his hand a fist and
  moves it across a bit) besides trophy wives? (Stewie laughs at this).
  Stewie: (Looking away from mirror) Yes that's rich. (Suddenley realizes
  who he's talking to (himself), shuts the mirror, and throws it at his
  cradle spinning toy ( a bunch of airplanes) that Stewie watch spin
  around and around and then turn into birds. A shocked Stewie sees the
  birds flock all across the room, and land right beside him on his doors
  and tables. The birds head then become those of Mr. T. )
  Mr. T Bird: Didn't want to be a mean guy. Wanted to be a dancer (T-
  Bird raises wing, which signals the other birds to raise theirs, and
  soon they begin to dance around Stewie, who looks away and then grab
  onto the rail of his crib).
  Stewie: Go away! (Makes shoong motion and falls off the crib and lands
  into some sort of ocean. He sinks and then resurfaces as the ocean
  begins to grow dark and the sky turns a purple magenta style of color.
  A giant fin appears in the water, which is revealed to be a Giant Lois
  Nose, that Stewie finds himself on, as it surfaces above the ocean and
  onto a black screen). YOU!
  Giant Lois: I am taking your brain. (looks at him sideways) You are now
  my slave.
  Stewie: Nooooooooo! (Falls off the nose and in to the sky, which is now
  purple magenta again, and falls into the ocean again. Regular Lois and
  Meg appear).
  Meg: Why is freaking out like that?
  Lois: Oh, he's having a little hallucination from the fever (A shot of
  Stewie in the tub, struggling against the water is shown). Just like
  when you were 3 and you accidently ate those adult brownies I was
  saving for the Doobie Brothers concert. (Shot of Golf Course again, as
  we see Chris taunt the hitters by making faces at them, then turning
  around as the balls hit, being protected by a giant pillow wrapped
  around his back. Laughs at them again as we see Cleveland Junior (with
  golf club) and Peter, on the course).
  Cleveland Junior: I'm gonna be on a cereal box! (Jumps up and down)
  Honeycomb pig! (turns around) Yeah Yeah Yeah! (turns around again) It's
  not small. (Turns around again) No No No!
  Peter: (Puts hand on Junior's arm) Alright, now pay attention, junior.
  Now you wanna keep your shoulders straight (demonstrates this) and
  you're knees bent (demonstrates this as well). And, uh, (close up on
  the two) just once, uh, for me, would, would you call me Mr. Drummond?
  (Shot of Chris picking up balls as Tanager appears from under the bush
  in a secret metal pipe).
  
  Tanager: Hey, Griffin down here! (Chris looks at him as he opens it all
  the way) Yeah it's a secret tunnel like in Hogan's Heroes, no big woop
  (makes fists) wanna fight about it? (takes check out of shirt) Anyway
  here's your first week's pay.
  Chris: (Takes the money and holds it in the air) All right Chris! (Runs
  up to Peter and Junior who are boarding a golf cart) Dad! Dad, look-
  Peter: (Waves to him) That's great Chris, but I'm trying to be a good
  father here. (looks at junior) I'm real proud of you champ, let's get a
  milkshake.
  Cleveland Junior: You got it Mr. Drummond. (The two drive off as Chris
  waves at them, looking sad. A shot of the exterior of Quagmire's house,
  as a young blonde female wearing a mail outfit comes to the door and
  rings it. Quagmire answers in nothng but his boxers.)
  Mail Girl: Package for Glen Quagmire. (Quagmire turns his head slowly
  and looks at her)
  Quagmire: Oh, uh excuse me. (Goes back inside and closes door. Opens
  door wearing nothing). I've got a package for you too. All Right! (Mail
  Girl takes mace out of her pocket and sprays it at him, but it dosen't
  effect him) Nice try, but I've built up an immunity. (Quagmire puts a
  robe on as the girl exits and drives off in the express car she came
  in. He runs past Chris, who is sitting on the sidewalk, looking sad.
  Quagmire notices him.) Hey, what's wrong kid?
  Chris: My dad doesn't care about me anymore.
  Quagmire: Oh, well. (takes one hand out of robe pocket and kind of
  points at Chris) Hey, at least you had a dad. When I was growing up, it
  was just me and my mom. (Flashback of baby Quagmire and his mom. Baby
  Quagmire is crying).
  Quagmire's Mom: Oh, look's like somebody's hungry. (Lifts up shirt and
  prepares to breast feed him. Baby Quagmire looks at this).
  Baby Quagmire: All right. (Sucks on the breasts a bit before we flash
  back to the present, where Chris is in Quagmire's house and Quagmire
  has changed his clothes into a white pants , white shirt, tan jacket
  get up).
  Chris: I just wanted him to be proud of me. (Quagmire enters from the
  back room) I even got a job.
  Quagmire: Well there's your problem. Jobs are for suckers. You just
  need to know how to have a good time. (Grabs him by the arm) Come on.
  (Cut to Quagmire and Chris in his car (his bumper license is Bushman)
  driving until they see a blonde woman on the left side of the street.
  Quagmire pulls over and looks at Chris). Go ahead kid, try it out.
  Chris: Uh, excuse me you dropped something. (looks to see if she
  dropped something) My jaw. (She looks disgusted at him) Heh heh, heh oh
  right. (Quagmire drives off)
  Quagmire: Heh, nice going. (he doesn't notice they're driving into a
  metal pole, and they end up smacking into it and activating the air
  bags: which are two blowup dolls that put their thong right by your
  face). Heh, all right.
  Chris: (At same time) All right.
  (A shot of the bowling alley, as we see Quagmire walking with the ball
  and rolling it, getting a strike).
  Quagmire: Oh! (A trio squad of females applaud his strike and he bows
  and blows a kiss to them. One of the girls (the short black haired one)
  ties up her bowling shoes and walks onto the alley, putting her regular
  shoes in her bag. Quagmire takes the bag and takes out the shoe (a pink
  pump) and sniffs it). Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhohooh! (Passes it to Chris, who
  sniffs it).
  Chris: Oh. (Shot of them driving along a path) I don't think I like
  feet as much as you do.
  Quagmire: (Notices something) Hey, everybody likes feet. Come on the
  party's just starting.
  (They pull up to a beach where you can see guys and girls on the surf.
  Quagmire runs off and takes of his shirt. Chris follows as the song
  begins to play).
  Beach People: (Singing and dancing on surf boards) I'm gonna grab my
  girl and head to the beach (The word Hic appears on screen)
  Hic-a-doo-la! (as do a doo and la) We're gonna all hang ten (shot
  focuses on female thong) and maybe then Hic-a-doo-la (The words appear
  on the screen again).
  Guys: (While holding surfboards with three girls on them) Cause I'm a
  Hic-a-doo-la guy.
  Girls: And I'm a Hic-a-doo-la girl.
  Guys and Girls: And together it is a Hic-a-doo-la world. Hic-a-doo-la!
  (Words appear on screen) (Shot of Chris and Quagmire dancing on
  surfboard's with a female).
  Chris: Mr. Quagmire, what does Hic-a-doo-la mean? (Everyone stops and
  looks at Chris)
  Everyone: What does Hic-a-doo-la mean?
  Beach Guy One: Well, Hic-a-doo la's the special feeling you get from
  holding hands with you're best gal.
  Beach Girl One: It's cheering real loud for the home team!
  Beach Guy Two: It's hitting the perfect wave!
  Adult Beach Goer: (Who looks like he's going to go sailing) It's
  obeying all the rules (The group of kids look at him)
  Group Of Kids: No Way! (The camerea goes back and forth with a crazy
  sound affect. The Group of kids grab him and run with him to the ocean
  (in one shot they seem to be going backwards, but then go forwards
  again, then back again, then forward, then back, then finally forward)
  and throw the guy into the sea. He spits up some water and looks at the
  kids. Shot over to Brian and Chris, each with a beach girl.)
  Quagmire: Hey, are we in Tieminamn, (Bobs his head back and forth)
  'cause I see a square.
  (Girls are now on the guys shoulders as the final Hic-a-doo-la goes
  across the screen with everyone singing to it. Quagmire bobs his head
  twice. Shot of the golf course as Junior puts in another ball).
  Peter: Ah, great shot, Cleveland Junior.
  Junior: Thanks Mr Drummond.
  Peter: Listen, uh, for today, can you call me Mr. Popadopolis?
  Junior: You got it (Sinks in another ball).
  Peter: (Folds his hands a bit) And would ya hate me if I called you
  Webster?
  Junior: (Looks at him angrily) That's the line!
  Peter: Oh, sorry. (Tom Tucker comes from off screen right).
  Tom Tucker: Hi, Tom Tucker, local news anchor and on my days off, golf
  enthuaist. You know the club's having a man-boy golf tournament and you
  two should enter.
  Peter: A tournament huh? (Scratches his chin) That gives me an idea
  (Motions for Tom) Come on, I'll explain in the car. (Peter and Tom run
  to Peter's car. They shut the door and Peter opens his hand) This is
  the perfect way to show my friends what a great father figure I've been
  to Cleveland Junior. I'll do it! (They exit the car. A shot of a strip
  club with the sign Fuzzy Clam and a door man as we see young ladies
  riding the poles and Chris and Quagmire just entering).
  Chris: Where should we sit?
  Quagmire: Uh, that's not up to me kid. (Points at his pants) I follow
  the old divining rod.
  (Gets pulled very quickly to the right, then pulled around Chris and
  into the lower right, then the left. A Brown haired stripper comes up
  to Chris).
  Stripper One: How old are you? (goes to touch Chris's cheek)
  Chris: Old enough to know you're a whore. (She pulls him off to the
  right. Meanwhile, another stripper (blonde this time) is by Quagmire,
  wearing a coat which she quickly takes off.)
  Quagmire: Woah! (As he says this, money falls out of his pockets. She
  then turns and removes her skirt) Woah hah hah! (More money falls out
  as she shakes it for him) Woah hah hah hah hah hah! (Meanwhile,
  stripper one is on one of the poles, her butt to Chris)
  Stripper One: Come on, (smacks her butt) talk to me, sweetie. (bends
  over with her head between her legs) You look a little down. (then
  pulls her head back up)
  Chris: I always thought I'd go to my first nudie bar with my dad, but
  he doesn't have time for me.
  Stripper One: Well, Sweetie (faces other way) part of growing up is
  learning adults aren't perfect. (closeup of face as she starts to take
  her top off and swings it a bit). Come on, your dad deserves another
  chance.
  Chris: Wow! You are smart (Back at Quagmire, he's staring at Stripper
  Two and pulls out his wallet) Heh heh, all right. (realizes nothing's
  there) No, no it's not alright. I'm out of cash. Hey, do you take bank
  cards?
  Stripper 2: Sure. (Wipes the bank card across her ass. She gasps and
  looks at him angrily).
  Quagmire: Can I get stamps too? (She slaps him. Shot of The Man-Boy
  Tournament, as Tom is in the foreground and Peter in crew are in the
  background).
  Tom: We're here at the 17th hole where Peter Griffin and Cleveland
  Junior are 5 strokes ahead, making victory all but a certainty. (Is
  shown peeing behind a bush and walking off. Junior sinks another hole,
  and the people slightly cheer).
  Peter: I told ya I could mold your son into champion. He's gonna be my
  greatest victory ever, except for the time I defeated my evil twin.
  (Flashback to top of city building, where Lois is holding a gun in
  front of two Peters.)
  Peter 1: Not me Lois, Shoot him. I'm the real Peter. (Lois switches gun
  back and forth)
  Lois: I don't know.
  Peter 2: Lois, look at me, you know your own husband, don't you? (Lois
  closes one eye and shoots Peter 1. The gun smokes and she drops it to
  the floor. Peter 2 walks over to her). Thank god, you made the right
  choice hunny. (goes to hug her. His face reveals to be metal for a
  second, but quickly switches to normal).
  Lois: What was that?
  Peter 2: (Turns to her) Nothing. (Flash to the Present)
  Peter: (Pats Cleveland Junior) One more hole and that man-boy trophy is
  ours. Here you go little buddy. (Tosses him the golfball, which he
  knees back and forth like a soccer player).
  Junior: Hey, look at me, I'm Pelle, I'm Pelle! (laughs and runs away
  from the tournament) Goal! (Laughs some more and is now out of sight).
  Peter: What the hell's he doing? (The others laugh at him).
  Cleveland: He's gone. Maybe you better stick to looking after you're
  own son. (they laugh again and walk out to the right. Peter gives a sad
  face. Cut to at night and Peter is hitting balls at the pratice spot.
  He looks right and sees Chris enter, carrying a basket of balls. Peter
  moves one over as Chris takes a shot. Peter scoots over another spot
  and turns around, hitting the balls at the parking lot now, breaking a
  car window and setting of an alarm. Chris smiles and turns around too,
  and hits another ball, this time at a lady. Peter moves over a spot).
  Guy: (Offscreen) Oh my god!
  Guy 2: Offscreen) Is she dead? (Peter smiles at Chris).
  Guy 1: No, I think she's still alive (Peter hits another golfball at
  the lot). No, That did it. (Both of them are hitting golfballs now, as
  we pan out to see the women hit and the ambulance arrive, getting the
  stretcher out).



Title: The Thin White Line

Theme Song
  Brian: I'm in a rut. Nothing thrills me anymore. I mean, I can't even
  think of a reason to get off the bed in the morning.
  Dr. Kaplan: Really?
  Brian: You want to know how pathetic my life is? I've seen that Behind
  the Music with Leif Garrett 18 times.
  [cut to Brian watching "Behind the Music" and mouthing the words]
  Friend: Hey uh, hey, Leif. It's been a while.
  Leif: Too long, man. I'm so sorry about everything, man. I'm so...
  Friend: You ready for a bombshell? You saved my life that night.
  Leif: But-but I was driving.
  Friend: I was on a road to destruction, man. The accident may have
  crippled me, but I'm alive, aren't I?
  Leif: Can we turn off the cameras, dude?
  Brian: It's like, it's like I'm, I don't know, trapped in my own life.
  Dr. Kaplan: Well, Brian, you may be too inwardly focused. Try thinking
  about the needs of others for a change. Why don't you do some volunteer
  work?
  Brian: That makes sense. Volunteer work. Thanks, Bruce.
  Dr. Kaplan: You still have 13 more minutes.
  Brian: Oh. Do I? Hmm. I notice you got a new receptionist. Nice little
  body on her, huh?
  Dr. Kaplan: That's my daughter.
  Brian: Well, we could probably call this an early day, huh?
  Mr. Weed: Attention, everyone. Due to several complaints and two deaths
  related to worker fatigue, I have decided to throw a company picnic
  this Saturday.
  Peter: Hey, Derek, how are you getting to the picnic?
  Derek: I don't know. I don't have a ride.
  Peter: Hey, John, you got a two-seater, don't you? Hey, Derek, maybe
  you go with John? Huh?
  Derek: For the last time, I'm not gay!
  John: Thanks anyway, Peter.
  Peter: Hey, we'll get him.
  [Brian is a guide dog, taking a blind man to a movie]
  Brian: Here. Right this way. Watch your step. Okay, they're in the
  woods. The camera keeps on moving. I think they're looking for some
  witch. I don't know. I wasn't listening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's
  happening. Something about a map. Nothing's happening. It's over. A lot
  of people in the audience look pissed.
  Meg: Now, remember, Chris we have to work together, so that our
  steps... [screams]
  Peter: Aw, this is my favorite event, "Catch the Greased Up Deaf guy."
  Mr. Weed: Go!
  Deaf guy: You're never gonna catch me! You're wasting your time! Forget
  about it! Go do something else! See you all next year!
  Brian: King me.
  Elderly woman: I don't want to play anymore. The pain. I can't live
  like this, Brian. I need you to pull the plug.
  Brian: I-I can't.
  Elderly woman: Be my angel and set me free. Please? [Brian goes for the
  plug] Oh, my God! You were really gonna do it! Nurse, this dog is
  trying to kill me! Nurse!
  Brian: You are twisted, lady! You hear me? You are screwed up in the
  head!
  Mr. Weed: The winner of our final contest will receive a very special
  prize. A week's paid vacation!
  Peter: Did you hear that? Oh, God, please, let it be farting. Please
  let it be a fart contest.
  Mr. Weed: These are tranquilizer darts. I have enough here to take down
  Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey-yes, well, the last one left standing
  wins. Let the game begin!
  Chris: All right, Dad!
  Lois: Go, Peter!
  Stewie: Look at him! He runs like a Welshman. Doesn't he? Doesn't he
  run like a Welshman?
  Joe: Hey there, Brian.
  Brian: Hi, Joe. Hey, Bonnie making chicken marsala tonight?
  Joe: No. She made that three nights ago. Wow, that's some nose you got!
  Brian: Yeah. One time it almost got me a spokesman deal.
  Toucan Sam: Follow your nose. Follow your nose. Follow your nose.
  Brian: [snickers] I'm sorry. No, that was good. I just didn't think you
  were gonna go so cartoony with it.
  Toucan Sam: Well, how would you read it?
  Brian: I don't know. I was thinking of doing it, you know, good, like
  an actor. But, you know, your way's good, too.
  Joe: You know, we could use a nose like that down at the precinct.
  Brian: Really?
  Johnson: I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter. One of us is
  gonna win that paid vacation.
  Peter: I don't want to feed Grandma bacon while she's in the bathtub.
  Johnson: Peter, are you okay?
  [Engine revving]
  Johnson: Mr. Weed, I think Peter needs a doc-oof!
  Mr. Weed: We have a winner!
  Peter: Here, kitty, kitty.
  Brian: No drugs. She's good. He's clean.
  Joe: It looks like that's it, except for the flight crew.
  Quagmire: Hey, Brian. What's with the Johnny Law routine?
  Joe: Say hello to our newest narc. He's a natural.
  Quagmire: Oh, yeah? How good are you?
  Brian: You're back from Manila. You had lumpia for dinner. Then you
  made love to two Filipino women...and a man.
  Quagmire: You mean three Filipino women! ...No!
  Brian: Wait a second. Got something.
  Joe: This could be the real deal, boys! Let's do it!
  [Joe and Brian book down the hallway to the "CHiPs" theme]
  Joe: Don't move, dirt bag!
  Brian: It's coke! Yes! All right, we've got him! This is great. Ah,
  this is the rush I've been looking for.
  Joe: Good work, Brian. You still got a little...
  Brian: Oh, oh. Thanks.
  Lois: So, Peter. Where shall we go for your week off?
  Peter: I was thinking we could all go to purgatory, like we did last
  year.
  Lois: This isn't bad. It's not that good. But it's not that bad.
  Brian: It's so-so.
  Peter: More or less.
  Peter: Hey, Brian. If cops are pigs, does that make you a Snausage?
  Brian: Clever, Peter. Did you stay up all night writing that?
  Peter: I got to bed around 2:00, 2:30.
  Brian: Do you know what Joe said the street value of that cocaine
  would've been?
  Lois: Let's see. Four and a half kilos uncut Nicaraguan...$1.7 mil,
  that area?
  Brian: Uh, yeah. That's right.
  Meg: You guys! Brian's famous!
  Lois: You're a hero!
  Peter: Way to go, pal!
  Brian: Oh, come on. Stop it, you guys. It's nothing, really. Lois. Your
  toast is ready.
  Lois: Oh, my.
  Brian: Meg's using a new conditioner.
  Meg: He's right!
  Peter: How do you like that?
  Meg: That's amazing.
  Brian: And it's time to change Stewie.
  Stewie: That's preposterous. I haven't...oh, there it is. All right.
  Brian: Stop the car! Over there. Everybody freeze! This is a bust!
  Joe: Brian, this is a Sunday School class.
  Brian: The hell it is! Pure Bogota bullion. This is a drug ring.
  Joe: But these are just kids.
  Brian: Oh, yeah? What's your name?
  Ricky: Ricky.
  Brian: They're not kids-they're midgets! Filthy, drug-peddling midgets!
  Joe: Oh, my God! Look out, Brian!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Joe: Nice work, rookie.
  Cop 1: You're a credit to the force.
  Cop 2: Additional generic cop compliment, Brian.
  Brian: Huh, thanks. But the real hero here is God for blessing me with
  this nose...and a few other equally amazing appendages.
  Joe: Well, I'd better take this cocaine down to Evidence.
  Brian: Hey, I'll do that. I'll catch up with you guys at the pub.
  Lois: So it's settled. We're taking a cruise to the Bahamas!
  Peter: Ah, this is gonna be great. Cruises are the best.
  Lois: And look. It says we have our choice of cabins, port or
  starboard. Ha! Listen to me. I sound like an old salt.
  Stewie: [Stewie laughs sarcastically] Yes, though I must say, I've
  always dreamed of a life at sea.
  [Comic operetta music] Stewie: â™ª I'm the
  greatest captain of the Queen's navy â™ª
  Sailors: â™ª And your record will stand as
  proof â™ª
  Stewie: â™ª Be it galley or a freighter,
  I'm an expert navigator â™ª
  Sailors: â™ª And you're also a world-class
  poof â™ª
  Stewie: â™ª My manner, quite effete, is
  mistaken on the street â™ª
  â™ª For a sailor who can pirouette on cue
  â™ª â™ª Well,
  despite your point of view, I can thrill a girl or two...
  â™ª â™ª But
  I'd rather get it on with you â™ª
  Brian: Sorry to be tardy to the party.
  Meg: Wow, Brian. Have you lost weight? You gotta tell me your secret.
  Brian: Here's a hint, put down the fork! Face!
  Lois: So how was your day?
  Brian: My day? Un-freakin'-believable! First, we nailed this bastard
  who hid his stuff in his daughter's doll! Her doll, for God's sake!
  Where's the line anymore? Well, I got news for you. It's not even on
  the radar screen! The days of decency and virtue are gone, honey! Bam!
  Freakin' evaporated, like a dingy, stinkin' mud puddle. One day you see
  your reflection in it and the next day, it's a damn oil spot on your
  cracked driveway, staring back at you, mocking you-blah blah
  blah-knowing the perverted truth that rots in the pit of your soul.
  That's how my freakin' day was.
  Peter: You know what I haven't had in a while? Big League Chew.
  Brian: So take it from me, McGriffin the Drug Dog, if you really want
  to get high, it's as easy as being yourself. Well, kids, I'm gonna pass
  things off now to...Gerald, the Happy and Abstinent Police Clown.
  Gerald: Hey, kids! Do you know why I'm happy? Because I'm free of
  S-T-Ds!
  Kid 1: That McGriffin guy was so cool!
  Kid 2: Totally! I'm never doing drugs now!
  Brian: Got milk? [Manic laughter]
  Peter: Now, Chris, before you go on a cruise, you gotta build up a base
  tan.
  Chris: But, Dad, I heard that if you use tanning beds, you can get
  something called "melanoma."
  Peter: Oh, that's just fancy talk for "sexified." Now climb in. Hey,
  what kind of tanning booth is this?
  Man: Can't you read? Those aren't tanning booths. That whole row is
  time machines!
  Peter: Oh, crap! Where the hell is he?
  Chris: Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days. And there's a whole stadium of
  people clapping for me. Oh, look. My very own lion!
  Peter: Oh, my God! Huh. Must've got the wrong hat.
  Rocky: And now, here's something we hope you'll really like.
  [Crime show instrumental music]
  Joe: Brian, there's no smoking in the terminal.
  Brian: Hey, hey, there's worse things than nicotine, pal! And I'm gonna
  find 'em.
  Horowicz: <Irish accent> Ah, patience, lad. It took dear
  St. Patrick more than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.
  Brian: Can the Irish crap, will you, Horowicz?
  Horowicz: <American accent> Okay.
  Brian: Open it!
  Man: Let me go! Help! Help!
  Brian: All right. Where's the stash? I'll do a freakin' body-cavity
  search, I swear!
  Joe: Sir, we apologize. Griffin, there's no easy way to say this. I
  think you have a drug problem.
  Brian: A drug problem? What's this really about? Jealousy? Am I
  stealing your thunder, Joe, is that it?
  Joe: Give me your badge.
  Brian: Fine! By the way, Horowicz, you should show Joe your impression
  of him.
  Horowicz Well, it's not as good as, you know, my Irish cop. It's just a
  little thing I.... "Look at me! I'm Joe! My legs don't work but I make
  up for it by having a very strong upper body!"
  Joe: Ha ha ha ha! Well, I do say that.
  Lois: Oh, 'The Old Man and the Sea.' I see you're getting in the mood
  for our cruise.
  Peter: Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sitting out there in a boat yammering to
  himself. He doesn't even know I'm watching him.
  Stewie: Splendid. Fido McCoke-Fiend is home.
  Brian: Everybody, this is Tina.
  Lois: What happened to you?
  Brian: How about a little less questions, and a little more shut the
  hell up?
  Stewie: You know, just because you can't feel your teeth, doesn't mean
  the girl can't feel your insults.
  Lois: Hello, I'm Lois Griffin. Welcome to our home.
  Tina: So, what? She's like your mom or something?
  Lois: Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to wipe the dried blood from
  under your nose?
  Brian: Here, baby, I'll show you the channel Lois doesn't know about.
  Lois: Brian will you-Chris, look away! Meg, take Stewie upstairs!
  Stewie: Wait, wait! That man seems to have suffered a rather serious
  snakebite!
  Lois: Brian, would you please ask your new friend to leave now?
  Brian: Oh, sorry. Things getting a little too real for the Stepford
  wife? And look at you two. Quasimodo and Lumpy. I leave more
  personality in tightly coiled piles on the lawn.
  Stewie: Do me! Do me next!
  Brian: Come on, baby girl. Let's go to the park.
  Brian: Doc. What the hell are you doing here?
  Dr. Kaplan: Your family has something they'd like to say to you.
  Meg: "Brian, I know I don't speak up much and it's really hard for me
  to talk about my feelings, but..."
  Dr. Kaplan: Why don't we start with someone more interesting? Peter?
  Peter: "Brian, ever since your addiction, you've been a jerk. I miss
  the good old days when you were my sidekick."
  [Peter as David Letterman]
  Peter: So she hated my tie until I told her it was made out of 100
  percent Buttafuoco fiber.
  [Studio audience laughing]
  Peter: Hey, Brian. How about a little tie music?
  Brian: [as Paul Shaffer] â™ª Peter's tie,
  Peter's tie, that's because Peter's the guy
  â™ª All right. That's it. A little tie
  music.
  Peter:Yeah!
  Brian: Look, you guys got it all wrong. I-I-I'm so sorry, everyone!
  God. I need help!
  Stewie: Well, I guess now we know what kind of dog he is. A
  melan-collie. Nothing? Wait. No. I should've said: "Chi-wah-wah." I
  don't have to f*cking impress you.
  Peter: Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois. But I just don't see why we
  gotta cancel our cruise just 'cause the dog's a cokehead.
  Lois: We're not going on vacation while Brian's in rehab. We'll just
  have to wait 'till next year.
  Peter: Aw, man!
  Brian: Peter, I'll make it up to you. I have a cousin who works at Club
  Med.
  [Brian's cousin Jasper singing and dancing to Buster Poindexter's "Hot
  Hot Hot"]
  Peter: Holy crap! Look at this place. This is where God would come if
  he had to stop doing blow.
  Meg: They have tennis courts!
  Stewie: And a full spa!
  Chris: Wow! No wonder people do drugs!
  Lois: Good luck, Brian. I just know you're gonna get clean.
  Peter: Heck. Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with all these mineral
  baths and Jacuzzis.
  Stewie: Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun, and everyone wets
  themselves. I give you gold, and I get squat. I'll be in the car.
  Doctor: That was a very productive first day, Brian. Our goal here is
  to find your X-factor, the element in your life that made you turn to
  drugs in the first place.
  Brian: Well, just having some time away to sort things out is gonna do
  wonders. Thanks, Doctor.
  [back in room]
  Brian: What are you doing here?
  Peter: I'm on vacation! Oh, and if anyone asks, I'm also on smack.
  Brian: Peter, this is a detox clinic. You can't vacation here.
  Peter: Why not? This place is way better than a cruise. You should've
  seen it. I whipped a speed freak's ass at horseshoes today.
  Brian: Peter, this isn't a vacation for me. For God's sake, I'm trying
  to get healthy!
  Peter: Yeah, okay, okay. All right. Hey, softball this afternoon. A
  bunch of us addicts are taking on the pregnant teenagers from across
  the lake.
  Woman: Okay, come on, everyone. Exercise is an important part of
  recovery. Just work with the resistance of the water. Ten more reps.
  Okay, and one, and two, and three...
  Peter: Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!
  [in lunchroom]
  Peter: I'll trade you this for your cupcake. What? It was just Carpet
  Fresh. I'm on your side.
  Doctor: I've been observing your behavior, and I don't think you're a
  addict. I think you're an idiot.
  Peter: Well, I don't pay you to think, Hot Lips. In fact, I don't pay
  you at all. Count it!
  Doctor: I'll be keeping my eye on you. What's your name?
  Peter: My name? <spots pea on plate>"Pea...<see
  girl crying>...tear...<sees the mythological griffin fly
  by>...Griffin." Yeah, yeah, Peter Griffin. Oh, crap.
  [Peter driving in golf cart]
  Peter: Hey, Brian, I was looking for you. Hey, you want to go mess with
  the pregnant teens across the lake?
  Brian: I can't. Group therapy, 2:00.
  Peter: Oh, man, I peeked in on one of those. It was more boring than
  when I was a security guard for George Harrison.
  [Music from Charles in Charge]
  Peter: â™ª Charles in Charge of our days
  and our nightsâ™ª
  â™ªCharles in charge of our wrongs and our
  rights and I sing I want Charles in
  Charge-â™ª Hey! Hey! Quiet down, up there!
  You wacky Beatle.
  Brian: Well, I have been making a lot of progress lately. I guess
  missing a session wouldn't be the end of the world.
  Peter: There you go!
  [Peter and Brian in rowboat]
  Peter: Hey, what do you think they put in the bug juice?
  Brian: Bugs.
  Peter: No, they don't! Come on! Shut up!
  [Brian and Peter do the old 'hand in the water' trick]
  [Women screaming in labor]
  [Babies crying]
  Doctor: Well, I hope you're proud of yourselves. 14 premature births!
  Brian: Sorry, Doc. I don't usually let Peter talk me into this kind of
  stuff.
  Doctor: Wait a minute. Brian, you have a pre-existing relationship with
  this degenerate?
  Peter: A degenerate, am I? Well, you are a fastizio. See? I can make up
  words, too, sister.
  Doctor: Well, I think we found your X-factor.
  Brian: What? Do you mean Peter?
  Doctor: His behavior is clearly a negative influence on you. With your
  intelligence and sensitivity, obviously...
  Brian: Whoa, hey! I made my own mistakes, all right? This man took me
  into his home, and he treated me like family. He's my best friend.
  Doctor: Yes. And look where you've ended up.
  Brian: You know what? I think my therapy here is complete. I came here
  to get clean, and I did. So good-bye.
  Peter: Brian, it's moments like this that make me sad you're gonna die
  50 years before I do.
  [Lois is playing piano to the tune of 'La Cucaracha']
  Lois: â™ª He was all coked up, and we were
  choked upâ™ª
  â™ªBut now we're happy Brian's home,
  Cha-cha-cha!â™ª
  Joe: I am serious, Lois. You could be in show business!
  Quagmire: Hey, Meg. 18 yet?
  Meg: No.
  Quagmire: Hey, Chris, how are you?
  Chris: Well, I'm glad I...
  Quagmire: All right!
  Joe: Brian, I feel a little guilty. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
  have been exposed to that junk.
  Brian: Joe, if I've learned anything from my experience it's that we're
  all responsible for our own destiny. And that's why I'm leaving.
  Peter: Leaving? You can't leave.
  Brian: I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.
  Lois: Somebody say something.
  Stewie: Brian, wait!
  Brian: Hold on a second. [Stewie spits in Brian's face] Airport, please.

Title: Brian Does Hollywood/Transcript

Narrator: Previously on Family 
                          Guy.
Lois: Oh, my God! Tell your 
                          father not to start the car!
Stewie: You want my badge number? 
                          Here! Here's my freakin' badge number!
Lois: I can't lose this case!
Peter: Lois, the case is already 
                          over!
Chris: [Crying] Who did this 
                          to you?
Lois: In all my years of research, 
                          I've never seen a virus reproduce this quickly.
[Intense instrumental music]
[Screaming]
Lois: Everyone I've told about 
                          the file is dead.
Meg: What do you mean, "Cut 
                          the blue wire"? They're all blue wires!
[in hospital room]
Meg: Face it. He's never coming 
                          out of that coma.
Stewie: [Screaming]
Lois: Brian's gone to Los Angeles 
                          to find himself!
Theme 
                          Song
Lois: Peter, don't throw out 
                          Brian's things. It's not like he's gonna be in Los Angeles 
                          forever. He just needs to find himself.
Peter: He's not coming back, 
                          Lois. You saw him. He just walked out on us. Oh, boy, did 
                          we have some good times!
Peter: Here it comes, buddy! 
                          Oh, God! Oh, God! [screaming] What are the odds?
Lois: Well, if he does come 
                          back, I want everything to be just how he left it.
Stewie: Easy! Massage the scalp! 
                          You're washing a baby's hair, not scrubbing vomit off your 
                          Christmas dress, you holiday drunk!
Meg: You guys! We got a letter 
                          from Brian!
Stewie: Tell him I'm not here.
Lois: Let me see.
Stewie: [Screaming]
Lois: I'm sorry, sweetie. There. 
                          All better?
Stewie: You know, you are some 
                          piece of work, lady. If you...well, actually, yes, it is.
Lois: <reads aloud> "Greetings 
                          from California. I've been very busy. Am having a great time 
                          trying to make it as a writer in LA. It's just as easy as 
                          everyone thinks it is. I've been working the room at a lot 
                          of Hollywood parties." Oooh.
[Jazz music playing]
Lois: Bobby, loved you in Raging 
                          Bull. Hey, Jodie, how's the baby? All right. Hey, I need more 
                          cheese puffs, Manny. Looks like Oprah's off the wagon again. 
                          And skip the toothpicks-she'll just hurt herself.
Waiter: Hey, Bri. Did you hear 
                          about Jason? Paramount bought his script.
Brian: They bought "Death Spares 
                          Not the Tiger"?
Waiter: 100 grand. Pretty good, 
                          huh?
Brian: Jeez! He's been in LA 
                          how long? Unbelievable. You know, he actually called the main 
                          character "John Everyman"? Come on. Well, good for him. [Breathes 
                          deeply]
[People chattering]
Brian: Keanu Reeves, wow! I 
                          don't usually gush. You'll have to forgive me. But when I 
                          was writing "Coast Guard"-that's what I do, I'm a writer-anyway, 
                          when I was writing "Coast Guard", I couldn't think of anyone 
                          other than...
[Pecking]
Brian: There's a woodpecker 
                          on your head.
Keanu Reeves: Yeah, he comes 
                          and goes.
Announcer: Now back to Kids

Bill Cosby: It's okay. Take 
                          your time. Then what happened?
Girl: He-he said he would kill 
                          me if I ever said anything.
Bill Cosby: Do you remember 
                          what he looked like?
Girl: Yeah. He had a scar on 
                          his arm. And he had a big, stupid doo-doo head!
Bill Cosby: "A big, stupid doo-doo 
                          head!"
[Audience laughing]
Lois: Honestly! The things these 
                          children come up with.
Announcer: If you have a child 
                          you'd like to exploit for a trip to Los Angeles why not have 
                          them try out for our show? Next auditions will be in New York, 
                          Chicago, and Quahog, Rhode Island.
Chris: Maybe Stewie could get 
                          on that show.
Stewie: You must be 'shrooming.
Meg: Yeah! We can get a free 
                          trip to LA and see Brian.
Peter: I haven't been to California 
                          since I lived with my other family.
[cut to dilapidated shack with Charles 
                          Manson and followers]
Peter: Guys, I just got invited 
                          to a party at Sharon Tate's house! You guys can come but you 
                          got to promise not to embarrass me.
Stewie: Talk, damn you! I know 
                          you've been plotting to foil my plans of world domination. 
                          Who are you working for? The Libyans? The French? Very well, 
                          if torture won't work, perhaps a little tenderness will. Mmm, 
                          I like your taste in women. Yes, I think she and I are going 
                          to have a good time together. Yes, you like this, don't you? 
                          Oh, God! Look at me, having sex with a pig. I've become my 
                          father!
Lois: Come on, Stewie. Let's 
                          get your sailor suit. You got to look cute if you're auditioning 
                          for national television.
Stewie: Lois, I told you there's 
                          no way...national television, you say? Coast to coast? That 
                          could be the ideal place to unleash my mass-hypnosis device 
                          on the unsuspecting public.
Lois: Oh, I always loved this 
                          little sailor suit. Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.
Stewie: Or you can make yourself 
                          useful and wipe my button. Circular motion, one finger. And 
                          don't you look at me!
Brian: Oh, my God, that's Michael 
                          Eisner. I'll take it from here, Julio. Here you go, Mr. Eisner. 
                          It's been Brian-ized. You might notice that new-script smell. 
                          Every car I hand-wash comes with a smile, an air freshener 
                          and a copy of my can't-miss coming-of-age teen comedy set 
                          in Wisconsin.
Michael Eisner: What's your 
                          name?
Brian: Brian.
Michael Eisner: Let's see. There 
                          we go, Brian. See you at Disneyland. Bring money.
Lois: Look. It's Tom Tucker 
                          from the news, and that must be his son. Oh, my!
Stewie: I feel bad staring without 
                          having paid for a ticket. I mean really, how am I supposed 
                          to follow that act? Bite the head off a chicken?
Jake Tucker: Dad, they're staring 
                          at me!
Tom Tucker: They're just jealous.
Man: [shuddering] You're next.
Tom Tucker: Wait a minute. Wait, 
                          we were next! Hey! Hey, don't walk away from me! Hey! [sighing] 
                          You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna get the video camera 
                          out and we'll make our own show.
Jake Tucker: I don't wanna!
Tom Tucker: Yes, you do! You 
                          do, because it's normal!
Man: Tell us, Stewie, what job 
                          does a mommy do?
Stewie: Interesting question. 
                          More to the point, how does one define "job" without branding 
                          oneself with useless labels? [sips coffee] I'm sorry, I'm 
                          afraid I answered your question with another question.
Man: Um, how old do you think 
                          Daddy is?
Stewie: 42. [Stuttering] Oh, 
                          I mean, Daddy's old! I think he's 7!
Men: [Laughing]
Stewie: Yes, that's it. Yes, 
                          that's what you want to hear, isn't it? Yes, jump through 
                          the hoop. "Daddy's feet smell!" Jackasses.
Man: Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, he's 
                          adorable. Congratulations. Stewie's gonna be on the show.
Peter: Did you hear that, Lois? 
                          We're going to Hollywood! Where the people are sexy and clever 
                          and they always say something funny right before the commercial 
                          break. [awkward silence]
Man: Oh, great. I always end 
                          up sitting next to a damn baby.
Stewie: What? What did you just 
                          say?
Lois: Stewie, stop fussing.
Stewie: Not now, Lois. Hey, 
                          big man, turn around. If you've got something to say, say 
                          it to my face! Oh, you can't hear me now? All right, that's 
                          it. I was going to watch the movie, but forget it. For the 
                          next five hours, you're my bitch. [Crying] My ears are popping, 
                          and there's no way to console me! I'm hungry and possibly 
                          teething! Maybe I'm wet. Who knows? I'm a baby. [Continues 
                          crying]
Man: <answering machine> 
                          <Jack Nicholson voice> This is a message for Brian. 
                          This is Jack Nicholson. Ah, listen, I read your script, and 
                          it just, you know, jumped right off the page. I think it's 
                          something I'd be excited to be a part of. So, call my... [laughing 
                          on machine] <regular voice> Listen, I'm just jacking 
                          you, man. Me and my buddy Phil just found your script at Starbucks.
Phil: Tell him it sucks!
Man: Yeah, it sucks! Give it 
                          up, loser! And don't put your number on the cover, you stupid. 
                          [Laughing]
Phil: I'm hungry.
[Phone ringing]
Brian: Jasper's residence.
Peter: Who the hell is Jasper? 
                          Where's Brian?
Brian: Peter? It's me. Jasper's 
                          my cousin. I'm using his place while he's working at Club 
                          Med. Are you on a cell phone?
Peter: Yeah. We're in LA!
Brian: What? What a terrific 
                          surprise!
Peter: Brian, can we see you 
                          for dinner? You're not too famous to get together with your 
                          old family, are you?
Brian: I was invited to the 
                          premiere of the new...Val Kilmer picture, but I'd much rather 
                          take you guys out to dinner. How about Musso and Frank's, 
                          8:00?
Peter: Okay, see you later, 
                          Mr. Bigshot. [swallows cell phone] Oh, crap, I didn't push 
                          "end." This is gonna cost me a fortune.
Jasper: Brian! Okay, I'm back. 
                          Tell me everything. I'm sitting, I'm hearing. That's Ricardo. 
                          Ricardo, Brian. He doesn't speak any English. Can I? Catching 
                          up. Okay, me first. I'm in love. Ooh, too much dressing. He's 
                          from the Philippines. I know, I know, I'm a rice queen. So, 
                          how's the writing thingy going?
Brian: Terrible. I can't even 
                          get my foot in the door.
Jasper: Oh, okay. I have somebody 
                          you have to meet. He's a producer. He's great.
Brian: Really? Thanks. That'd 
                          be great.
Jasper: So, do you like Sex 
                          and the City?
Brian: Yeah. It's an all right 
                          show.
Jasper: I wasn't talking about 
                          the show. I'm nasty! <foghorn noise> Someone send me 
                          out to sea!
Meg: It says that this is the 
                          actual gutter where the policeman fell over laughing after 
                          Eddie Murphy told him he was just giving the transvestite 
                          a ride home.
[Phone ringing]
Peter: I think that's me. Hello?
Quagmire: Hey, Peter, it's Quagmire.
Peter: Oh, hey, Quagmire.
Quagmire: Guess what? Last night 
                          I had sex with a black chick.
Peter: I got to go. Sorry.
Black Woman: What? All he said 
                          was "black chick."
Peter: Yeah, I know. But your 
                          boyfriend looks like one of your typical angry black guys, 
                          and I didn't want to offend him. Hey, we cool, G? Yeah? All 
                          right!
Brian: I was thinking Halle 
                          Berry would be perfect as the camp counselor all the kids 
                          want to "get with."
Porn director: Jasper was right. 
                          You're very talented. You know, I'm having a brainstorm here. 
                          Have you ever thought about directing?
Brian: Just every waking hour!
Porn director: I got this movie. 
                          I'm not gonna lie-it's a low-budget movie, but the script 
                          is solid. My director dropped out. And I need somebody who's 
                          smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth.
Brian: I am smart and ambitious!
Porn director: [Laughing] Seriously.
Brian: No, no. I'm clean.
[at restaurant]
Brian: You know, Musso and Frank's 
                          is famous. See the bar over there? Great writers like Hemingway 
                          and Faulkner drank there.
Peter: Where did that guy who 
                          wrote Porky's drink? Oh, man! When that fat broad grabbed 
                          that kid's crank through the hole...ah! Where do they get 
                          their ideas? Where do they get them? You're the writer. You 
                          tell me.
Brian: Ah, boy! This is great. 
                          All that searching, that emptiness I felt back home, gone. 
                          I think I finally found my life's calling, you know?
Lois: How wonderful! You know, 
                          Brian, I've always found your writing to be a little hackneyed 
                          and stilted, but I guess that's why I'm not working out here 
                          in Hollywood, huh? Oh, congratulations on all your success.
Brian: Uh, thank you. You know 
                          what might be a thrill for you guys?
Chris: Ooo! Ooo! Eating a pebble!
Brian: Yes, but I was talking 
                          about stopping by the set to see me in action.
Lois: Brian, could we really?
Brian: You do know somebody 
                          in the business.
Stewie: Yes, well, I'm in the 
                          business, too. I'm going to be on television.
Brian: Great.
Stewie: Yes, and when I make 
                          my appearance I promise you'll talk about it at the water 
                          cooler the next day.
Brian: Yeah, well, good luck 
                          with that.
Stewie: "Yeah, well, good luck 
                          with that." Yutz.
[Phone ringing]
Woman: I'm trying to reach Peter 
                          Griffin.
Peter: You're in him.
Woman: Mr. Griffin, are you 
                          happy with your long-distance service?
Peter: Yes, and I'm sick and 
                          tired of you people always calling during dinner. I demand 
                          to speak to your supervisor.
Woman: Hold, please.
[muffled version of Barry Manilow's 
                          "Looks Like We Made It" heard playing as hold music]
Lois: Peter, I love this song. 
                          Open your mouth.
[Peter opens mouth, music gets louder]
Porn director: Brian, right 
                          on time. I like that. Come in. So, ready? Ready to shoot your 
                          first scene?
Brian: I sure am. Where's the 
                          set?
Porn director: Second door on 
                          your left.
Brian: So, this is some kind 
                          of shampoo commercial, right?
Porn actress: Do I have to sleep 
                          with the dog in this one?
Stagehand: Hey, can someone 
                          fluff Paul? He's got like a windsock thing going on.
Brian: So, this is some kind 
                          of shampoo commercial, right? Look, Zack, I'm sorry. There's 
                          just no way I can do this. I mean, I've been around, you know. 
                          I've licked my share of peanut butter. But I just-I think 
                          you need to find yourself a new director.
Porn director: Are you sure?
Brian: I just can't do this.
Porn director: Come on, is this 
                          any more degrading than washing cars? At least here you can 
                          be creative.
Brian: Look, I want to make 
                          this perfectly clear. There is absolutely no way I would possibly 
                          consider doing something like this. [porn actress drops robe] 
                          Unless I saw a script first.
Porn director: Of course.
Brian: You know, this isn't 
                          bad.
Porn director: It's kind of 
                          like Bang the Drum Slowly, except the drum's a chick.
[Car horn honking]
Lois: Peter, slow down. Brian 
                          said he was gonna be on the set all day. "On the set." Listen 
                          to me. Two days in Hollywood, and I sound like a contract 
                          player.
[Police siren]
Peter: Oh, crap! The LAPD!
[Screaming]
Lois: Come on, Peter, I want 
                          to save some tape for the Hollywood sign.
Peter: Okay. Thanks a lot, you 
                          guys.
Police Officer: Our pleasure. 
                          Have a nice vacation, sir.
Jenna Jameson JENNA: Yes! Yes! Yes! 
                          [Heavy breathing]
Brian: Cut. Uh, okay. Nice take, 
                          Jenna. But let's try giving the lines a little subtext this 
                          time. Your husband's always away on business, and you feel 
                          increasingly isolated and unloved. So you begin to think maybe 
                          you should go back to graduate school and finish your dissertation. 
                          And that's when you notice the cable man has taken his pants 
                          off.
Peter: Wow! A real movie set. 
                          Hey, this house looks kind of familiar.
Chris: I'll bet Samuel L. Jackson 
                          is here. He's in everything. There's Brian!
Brian: Samuel, when you lay 
                          her down in front of the fireplace I want you to enter from...oh, 
                          my God! Hey, you guys!
Meg: Hey, Brian? Can I be in 
                          the movie?
Porn Producer: Well, actually, 
                          one of the Jacuzzi girls didn't show up. How long can you 
                          hold your breath underwater, sweetie?
Meg: Real long. One time at 
                          Hatch Pond...
Brian: No! Absolutely not! This 
                          is a closed set! You gotta leave! Get these people out of 
                          here, now!
Peter: Oh, what, now that you're 
                          a big director, we embarrass you?
Brian: No, no! I mean, yes.
Stewie: Does anyone else smell 
                          Astroglide?
Make-up artist: You're gonna 
                          look so handsome.
Stewie: Look at these crow's 
                          feet. My God! You stay up past 7:30, and you pay for it in 
                          the morning.
Peter: Who the hell does Brian 
                          think he is?
Lois: Well, maybe he thought 
                          we'd get in the way. It wouldn't be the first time you've 
                          disrupted a performance.
[Whimsical music playing] [Cut to 
                          production of "Cats." Peter drives on stage and hits an actor]
Peter: Oh, jeez! Oh, God! Oh, 
                          God! I didn't see it! It jumped right out in front of my car! 
                          Oh, I am so sorry!
Lois: I think we just have to 
                          face it, Peter. Brian's a big-time Hollywood director, and 
                          we're just simple, small-town people.
Stewie: Um, all right, one more. 
                          One more. Rob Lowe.
Make-up artist: Straight.
Stewie: No!
Make-up artist: Yes.
Stewie: Come on. Stop!
Make-up artist: Ho-hum.
Stewie: Pull over.
Make-up artist: Absolutely.
Stewie: Really?
Make-up artist: Yes.
Stewie: Oh, well, he hides it 
                          well.
Make-up lady: Yeah, he wishes.
[Audience applauding]
Bill Cosby: "Stewie." That's 
                          a funny name, "Stewie." It's like "stew," only with an "eeee" 
                          at the end. I meant, it's funny, Stewie. You see, I had an 
                          uncle named Stewie, and he used to sell bicycles.
Stewie: I'm sorry, aren't you 
                          supposed to be asking me a question?
Bill Cosby: Stewie, what do 
                          you think candy is made out of?
Stewie: Sunshine and farts! 
                          What the hell kind of question is that?
Bill Cosby: I love candy! When 
                          I was a little boy, we would play stickball!
Stewie: Oh, no. I'll wait. Oh, 
                          you finished? I'm sorry. It's my fault, really. I thought 
                          the name of the show was 'Kids Say the Darndest Things' not 
                          'Old Black Comedians Never Shut the Hell Up.' Ask me what 
                          I want to be when I grow up.
Bill Cosby: We also used to 
                          play buck-buck.
Stewie: Enough of your blather. 
                          [dons mind control goggles] Good evening, world. From this 
                          moment on, I will be your...
Bill Cosby: [Chuckling] What 
                          have you got there? You gonna go skiing now?
Stewie: Give them back to me! 
                          They're of no use to you!
Bill Cosby: I'm going down the 
                          mountain.
Audience: [Laughing]
Stewie: No! Don't listen to 
                          him! That's not funny! That's just saying what happens when 
                          you go skiing!
Bill Cosby: Here I go, down 
                          the slope. I'm going zip zop...
Audience: [Laughing]
Stewie: Stop it! Stop applauding 
                          him! He's not even using real words anymore!
Bill Cosby: We'll be back with 
                          a little girl from Atlanta who skips rope with her sister's 
                          pigtails. [Making ridiculous noises]
Stewie: No! My segment's not 
                          over!
Bill Cosby: Come on, little 
                          fellow. You like to jump rope, don't you?
Stewie: I-like-jump rope.
Bill Cosby: All right. So, you're 
                          gonna just sit here and enjoy it.
Stewie: I'm gonna sit here and 
                          enjoy it. And I like pudding. And Ghost Dad was the best movie 
                          I've seen since Leonard Part 6.
Audience: [Audience applauding]
Jasper: Good news! Good news!
Brian: What, more people I love 
                          think I'm an arrogant jerk?
Jasper: You're more than that 
                          Mr. "Nominated for an Adult Movie Award for Best Director."
Brian: A Woody? I'm up for a 
                          Woody?
Jasper: C'mon, call your family. 
                          I'll bet they'll be really proud of you.
Brian: No, I'd rather they think 
                          I'm a jerk than a smut peddler.
Jasper: Brian, they're your 
                          family. They'll love you even if you made a couple of crappy 
                          movies. I mean, Blythe Danner still loves Gwyneth Paltrow. 
                          Ooh, score one for me!
Melissa Rivers: Welcome back 
                          to E!'s Adult Video Awards preshow. It's a good crowd here 
                          tonight, Mom.
Joan Rivers: It sure is, Melissa. 
                          All the studs and sluts are arriving. Brian! Brian!
Brian: Uh, hey.
Joan Rivers: You're nominated 
                          for three of the seven films you directed yesterday: Add Momma 
                          to the Train, The Purple Head of Cairo and, uh-what was the 
                          third one?
Brian: You've Got Male Genitalia.
Joan Rivers: You know, I was 
                          asked to star in a porno once. Yeah, but I couldn't. 'Cause, 
                          you know, most of my body is less than 18 years old. [Laughing] 
                          I used to guest host The Tonight Show.
Brian: Oh, yeah. What was that, 
                          like, 30 years ago? Your mike isn't plugged in. You're not 
                          even on television right now, are you?
Joan Rivers: In my mind! [Groaning]
Ron Jeremy: The next award is 
                          for Best Original Score in an adult film. And the nominees 
                          are Ron Jones...[funky music playing]...Walter Murphy...[similar 
                          funky music]...and John Williams.[Orchestral music playing]
Lois: Well, you've come a long 
                          way from hiding from the vacuum cleaner.
Brian: Lois!
Peter: Hey, buddy. Hey, how 
                          are you, Alfred Hitch"cock"? You like that one, Dick Hertz? 
                          I'm sorry. I'm already drunk.
Brian: How did you guys know?
Lois: Jasper called. Brian, 
                          why didn't you tell us?
Brian: I thought you'd be ashamed 
                          of me.
Peter: You kiddin'? I ought 
                          to knock you out for not bringing me here sooner. Look at 
                          the pair on that one, Lois. Bigger than your head.
Brian: So, you guys aren't offended 
                          by this?
Lois: Well, I can't say I approve, 
                          but we love you. If this is what makes you happy, we support 
                          you.
Brian: My God! I thought I needed 
                          to get away from you guys to find what was missing in my life 
                          but the only thing I'm missing is my family. How could I ever 
                          have become involved in this filthy, degrading business?
Ron Jeremy: ...And the award 
                          goes to Brian Griffin!
Audience: [Cheers]
Brian: Wow! My God! This is 
                          unexpected. I want to thank my incredible production team, 
                          who've been with me from 'Shaving Private Ryan' all the way 
                          to 'Welcome to My Face.'
Lois: He lives with us back 
                          in Quahog.
Porn Producer: You got a nice 
                          wiggle, baby. You want to be in a movie, huh? A little girl-girl 
                          action, maybe?
Lois: Peter!
Peter: Good luck, buddy. I've 
                          been barking up that tree for 17 years.
[back on airplane]
Lois: Well, that was a wonderful 
                          trip! And everyone has something to remember it by.
Peter: You're gonna love it 
                          at our house, Jenna Jameson.

Title: Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington

Theme Song
  Lois: That's funny. I don't remember buying Stewie these toys. Oh, my
  God! It all makes sense now. My baby is some kind of diabolical genius
  bent on world domination!
  Stewie: [slow clapping] Bravo, Lois. The last horse finally crosses the
  finish line.
  Lois: Stewie! All these months I should've been paying attention to
  what you've been saying. You're an evil child. Why? Why did I have to
  go and smoke pot when I was pregnant with you?
  Stewie: Cheer up, Mother. You should be proud. You've given birth to
  the future emperor of the world. Pity you won't be around to enjoy it.
  Cheerio!
  Lois: [Screams]
  Peter: Lois. Lois! What's the matter?
  Lois: I just had the strangest dream. Something about Stewie and
  Cheerios. It's gone.
  Peter: Well, come on, get up. It's opening day for the Sox. Hey, Chris,
  Meg, we're going to Fenway!
  Lois: Peter, you can't pull the kids out of school for a baseball game.
  Peter: Aw, there's nothing these kids learn in school they can't learn
  on the street.
  Gang Member: It's 3:00. Where the hell is Louie?
  Gang Member 2: Well, you tell me. Louie left his house at 2:15 and has
  to travel a distance of 6.2 miles at a rate of 5 miles per hour. What
  time will Louie arrive?
  Gang Member: Depends if he stops to see his ho.
  Gang Member 2: That's what we call a variable!
  Chris: Look what I made for the game. [holds up sign reading John 3:16]
  Meg: What does that mean, anyway?
  Brian: <reading from Bible> "And the Lord said, 'Go,
  Sox."'
  Meg: Dad, don't you have to work today?
  Peter: It's nothing a little phone call can't take care of.
  Mr. Weed: Hello?
  Peter: Mr. Weed? I can't come to work today. I was in a terrible plane
  crash. My entire family was killed, and I am a vegetable. I'll see you
  tomorrow. <hangs up> Huh? Huh?
  Brian: Oh, please, Peter. Your excuses are lamer than FDR's legs.
  All: [Gasping]
  Brian: Too soon?
  Mom: Here it comes, Jeremy!
  Jeremy: I got it! I got it!
  Peter: Yes! Yeah! All right! I'm the man! Yeah! Hold on to this,
  Stewie. It'll be a souvenir of your first major-league game with your
  dad.
  Stewie: My God. I shall cherish this forever. I say, Opie, I'll trade
  you this baseball for your souvenir bat.
  Boy: Sure!
  Stewie: What did you learn?
  Peter: This is great. We haven't done anything together like this since
  we saw Mike Tyson get beat.
  [cut to National Spelling Bee]
  Moderator: The word, again, is "onomatopoeia."
  Mike Tyson: Uh..."C."
  Moderator: I'm sorry. That's incorrect.
  Mike Tyson: Oh, dang!
  Lois: I'm so glad you talked us all into playing hooky.
  Peter: Me, too. Hey, maybe we can get on TV if we take our shirts off
  and run onto the field.
  Lois: Peter, I'm not taking my shirt off.
  Peter: [pulls up Lois' shirt] There. Now they're old news.
  Lois: Peter!
  Peter: Go, Sox! [tumbles down steps] [Screaming] Hmmm.[Snorting hot
  dog] [Snorting mustard]
  Mr. Weed: Peter?
  Peter: Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Weed.
  Mr. Weed: Well, tt seems you've made a full recovery.
  Peter: Oh, yeah. That plane crash I told you about, it turned out to be
  gas.
  Mr. Weed: Aha! Liar! Tomorrow, my office, 9:30.
  Peter: I'm tired of Mr. Weed treating me like a common doormat. I want
  him to treat me like one of those deluxe one from Pottery Barn with the
  fancy straw.
  Brian: I don't care for Pottery Barn. Peter, if you want Mr. Weed to
  respect you, you're gonna have to earn it.
  Peter: Hmm, "earn it." [Snorting drink]
  Mr. Weed: Why have you forsaken me?
  Peter: Uh, Mr. Weed? I heard you ran into my identical twin brother at
  the ball game yesterday. And if you don't buy that, I'm sorry I was at
  the ball game yesterday.
  Mr. Weed: Peter, I just received terrible news. This company has been
  taken over by a conglomerate. After 23 years of faithful service, I've
  been terminated!
  Peter: Wow, the business world sure is funny.
  [cut to "Dilbert"]
  Wally: Hey, Dilbert, what do you call it when a guy in middle
  management moves all the way to upper management?
  Dilbert: I don't know. What do you call it?
  Wally: A promotion.
  Dilbert: Oh, thanks. Here's a memo.
  Peter: Well ometimes the business world's funny.
  Executive: And so, on behalf of the El Dorado Cigarette Company I'd
  like to welcome you to our family. I think you'll be very happy with
  the changes we've made.
  Peter: Aw, this is sweet! Why are you putting a window in the middle of
  the factory?
  Construction worker: So Aunt Bee has a place to let her pies cool.
  Aunt Bee: Hello, boys. Today's pie is cherry. It'll be ready just in
  time for lunch.
  Peter: Wow, these guys sure know how to run a company.
  Executive: Look how happy those morons are. They'll never realize we're
  using those toys to get children addicted to our company's cigarettes.
  All: [Laughing maniacally]
  Executive: [Whistles] Good boy, Connor. Pull.
  All: [Laughing maniacally]
  Chris: Can't we eat? I'm so hungry I could ride a horse. I don't get
  it. Well, I could ride it to the store, I guess.
  Lois: I told you we're not starting without your father. Dinner just
  isn't dinner without him.
  Stewie: Well, perhaps I could help simulate the experience. [throws
  face into food] [makes ridiculous noises]
  Peter: Hey, family. Anyone in the mood for lobste-oh, God! One of them
  has my pupil! [Screaming]
  Brian: Peter, how the hell can you afford lobster on your salary?
  Peter: I got a raise.
  Brian: What?
  Peter: Yeah. The new owners gave everyone raises. Even Kenneth, the
  bad-ass mail clerk with the heart of gold.
  [cut to mail room]
  Peter: Hi, Kenneth. Hey, did I get any mail?
  Kenneth: No! But if you come any closer, I'll slice you!
  Peter: Okay! Okay! Man, what a bad-ass!
  Man: Yeah? That bad-ass just gave half his paycheck to orphans. Orphans
  with diseases!
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Peter: And check out the new toys we're making.
  Meg: "Baby Smokes-A-Lot"?
  Baby Smokes-A-Lot: [smokes][Baby giggling] Tastes like happy.
  Chris: Cool! That's imitatable!
  Brian: What the hell? El Dorado Cigarettes? That's who bought your
  company?
  Lois: Oh, my God! They're trying to corrupt our children!
  Brian: Well, what do you expect? Those bastards turned a whole
  generation of Americans into smokers with their damned subliminal
  advertising.
  Ma: Timmy, where's Lassie?
  Timmy: She's out in the orchard, Ma. Peaches are coming in mighty early
  this year.
  Jerry: Smoke!
  Ma: You know what they say, Timmy. "Early peaches, long summer."
  Jerry: Smoke!
  Lassie: [Barking]
  Timmy: What's that, Lassie?
  Jerry: Are you smoking yet?
  Lois: Peter, if kids see this doll, they're gonna think smoking's okay.
  You have to talk to your new bosses first thing in the morning.
  Peter: Don't you worry, Lois. I'll set them straight. Just like I did
  with Chris.
  Chris: Dad, what's the blowhole for?
  Peter: I'll tell you what it's not for, son. And when I do, you'll
  understand why I can never go back to Sea World.
  Peter: Gentlemen, we need to talk. My wife says you're trying to get
  kids to smoke.
  Executive: That's just not true.
  Peter: What about this toy?
  Executive: Peter, it's just a doll with a cigarette. I mean Barbie has
  a Dream Car, but you don't see every 8-year-old driving. They're just
  fun toys.
  Jerry: Smoke!
  Executive: Not now, Jerry. Trust me, Peter. The last thing we want is
  to get kids to start smoking.
  Peter: What about that graph on the wall that says: "The first thing we
  want is to get kids to start smoking"?
  Executive: That? Oh, that's just something my son made me in art class.
  Peter: Then what about that poster that says: "The graph was not made
  in art class. We really do want kids to start smoking"?
  Executive: Look, we're a caring company. I mean, would you really be
  the president of a company that didn't care about kids?
  Peter: No. But I'm not the president.
  Executive: Yes, you are, if you want to be.
  Men: [Agreeing]
  Peter: Oh, wow. Imagine, me, president.
  [Joyful instrumental music] [Peter struts around the Oval Office]
  Peter: I'll do it!
  [Griffins' kitchen]
  Peter: [sings "Hail to the Chief" off-key]
  Lois: So how did it go?
  Peter: I'm not finished yet. [more "Hail to the Chief"] Aren't you
  gonna ask me how it went?
  Lois: Yes! Did you talk to the company executives?
  Peter: [more "Hail to the Chief"]
  Lois: Peter, answer me!
  Peter: Yeah, I did! They made me president.
  Meg: Of the whole company?
  Chris: All right, Dad!
  Peter: You should've seen the way they were treating me. I never got
  that kind of respect before.
  [cut to Peter working as a swim coach]
  Peter: Great workout, Bobby.
  Boy: Up yours, sack breath!
  Peter: That's "Mister Griffin."
  Lois: But, Peter, why would they make you president?
  Peter: Maybe it's because I can recite all 50 states in a quarter of a
  second. [Yelps]
  Lois: Peter, that was just a loud yelping noise.
  Peter: Jeez, Lois, I thought you'd be proud of me. After all these
  years, the company thinks I'm worth something. Wait till you see all
  the perks we're gonna get.
  Meg: Um, hi. Can I help you?
  Ugly Girl: Some company hired me to stand next to you so you'd look
  better by comparison.
  Meg: That's ridiculous. I don't need...
  Boy: Meg, did you get less ugly?
  Meg: Yeah!
  Peter: Surprise!
  Lois: Everything looks the same.
  Peter: Oh, it looks the same, but actually El Dorado Cigarettes has
  coated the entire inside of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so
  it's easy to clean.
  Lois: Oh!
  Peter: Maybe I shouldn't have had them do the floors.
  Stewie: I'm "Nudes on Ice"!
  Lois: This is so exciting. Your father's first day as president.
  Peter: Good morning, First Family. Ooh, Lois, what's in this coffee?
  Lois: Isn't it wonderful? The company sent Martha Stewart to help me
  with the housework. I take back all the bad things I said about them.
  The coffee is delicious, Martha.
  Martha Stewart: A little chicory perks up the taste of roasted coffee
  beans. It's a good thing.
  Brian: Well, I think it's a crappy thing! In fact, this is my last
  cigarette, ever. You make me sick, letting yourselves be bought off
  with a few lousy perks.
  Stewie: Oh, I beg to differ.
  Valet: Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr. Griffin. You have an
  executive parking space now.
  Peter: But that looks exactly like my old space.
  Valet: Yeah, but this one comes with your own company suck-up.
  Suck-up: Morning, Mr. Griffin. Nice day.
  Peter: It's a little cloudy.
  Suck-up: It's absolutely cloudy, one of the worst days I've seen in
  years. So, good news about the Yankees.
  Peter: I hate the Yankees.
  Suck-up: Pack of cheatters, that's what they are. I love your tie.
  Peter: I hate this tie.
  Suck-up: It's awful, it's gaudy, it's gotta go.
  Peter: And I hate myself.
  Suck-up: I hate you, too. You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.
  Peter: But I'm the president.
  Suck-up: The best there is.
  Peter: But you just said you hated me.
  Suck-up: But not you, the president, the you who said you hated you
  who...love, hate, Yankees, clouds...[head explodes]
  Valet: I'll have that fixed for you tomorrow, sir.
  Executive: Here's your new digs. Now, get to work, sport. We're
  counting on you.
  Peter: Wow. My own office. Well, I guess I'd better get busy. [Pencil
  sharpening][sighs][sticks finger in pencil sharpener] Ah! [looks
  furtively around and unzips pants][prolonged screams]
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Executive: Gentlemen, we have a problem. There's an anti-smoking bill
  before Congress that could put us out of business.
  Executive 2: Yes. Apparently causing cancer is this year's "hot button."
  Executive: I don't understand it. We've tried everything to get through
  to these politicians. Harvard lawyers, lobbyists, wisecracking
  leprechauns.
  Leprechaun: Excuse me. Do you have a dollar? I'm a little short.
  [Laughs]
  Executive 3: Maybe that's the problem. They're all idiots in
  Washington. Instead of a smart guy, we should send a moron they can
  relate to.
  Executives: Yeah. Yeah. Good thought.
  Executive: But where are we going to find someone within the company
  who's that stupid?
  Executive 2: Yeah. And not just stupid. Fat, too.
  Executives: Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what we need.
  Executive 3: Hey, wait a second. Didn't we just make a fat, stupid guy
  president?
  Executive: You bet we did. Gentlemen, our new tobacco lobbyist is That
  Guy!
  [theme from "That Girl"]
  Singers: ? Diamonds, daisies, snowflakes, That Guy ? ? Chestnuts,
  rainbows, springtime is That Guy ? ? He's tinsel on a tree ? ? He's
  everything that every guy should be ? ? Sable, popcorn, white wine,
  That Guy ? ? Gingham, bluebirds, Broadway is That Guy ? ? He's mine
  alone, but luckily for you ? ? if you find a guy to love ? ? only one
  guy to love then he'll be That Guy, too ? That Guy!
  Peter: So, uh, what's this big assignment you got for me, Chairman of
  the Broad?
  Executive: [Laughs] "Chairman of the Broad." When did you become such a
  stitch?
  Peter: Don't you remember? You gave me writers. "Sir, I don't want to
  say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go,
  'Whoopee!"' That wasn't funny. I thought you guys said you were Jewish.
  Writer: He's only half-Jewish.
  Peter: You're fired.
  Executive: Here's the thing, Griffin. Some troublemakers in Congress
  are trying to shut us down. We need someone important, like you, to go
  down to Washington and help those bastards see what kind of fun-Ioving
  people the tobacco industry's really made of.
  Peter: Washington? Ah, sweet. I'm your man. But I gotta warn you-I made
  enemies on the Hill.
  [Peter at Senate confirmation hearing]
  Peter: And that's when Clarence Thomas forced me into his chambers and
  showed me lewd pictures.
  Senator: Mr. Griffin, we have indisputable evidence that not only have
  you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been
  in the same state. How do you respond to that?
  Peter: Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Howard Stern's penis! Baba Booey! Baba
  Booey! Baba Booey!
  Meg: How long will Dad be in Washington?
  Lois: As long as it takes. He's a very important man now. You know,
  he's the spokesman for his entire industry.
  [montage of Peter in cigarette ads]
  Lois: Thank you, Martha. Brian, could you pass me the TV Guide?
  Brian: Piss off!
  Lois: What?
  Brian: I'm sorry. It just feels like forever since I've had a smoke.
  I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail!
  Peter: Hello, Mr. Harrison? Yeah, I see those government guys you were
  telling me about. I'll show them a good time and bring them around to
  our side. Excuse me. Al Gore, George W. Bush?
  Al Gore: Yes?
  George W. Bush: Yes?
  Peter: Ah, great. And what's your friend's name?
  Al Gore: Dick Armey.
  Peter: [Laughs] No, seriously. What's his name?
  Al Gore: Dick Armey.
  Peter: [Laughs]
  Al Gore: [Laughs] Oh, I just got it.
  Peter: Hey, Armey. What's your wife's name? "Vagina Coast Guard"? Nah,
  I'm kidding, you guys. Hey, get in the car. We're going to a skin bar.
  All: Great. Yeah. Sounds good.
  Senator: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I don't know
  what happened!
  Peter: Whoa, it's okay, it's okay, Senator. This girl didn't have a
  family. It'll be like she never existed. Now grab a hold of yourself.
  All right. Now, listen. You may have killed her when you shoved those
  dollar bills down her throat. You may have killed her when you hit her
  with the stool. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. But I'll tell you what
  didn't kill her. Smoking!
  Al Gore: You have our support, Griffin.
  Lois: Look, kids. Here's your father in People magazine with Jim
  Carrey. And they're both "Smokin'!" I loved that in Mask. "Smokin'!"
  "Smokin'!" "Smokin'!"
  Brian: Damn it! Do I have to listen to this drivel 24 hours a day? But
  I guess anything's better than looking at your smelly face!
  Meg: Mom!
  Lois: Honey, your face smells fine. You know he doesn't mean it. It's
  just the lack of nicotine.
  Chris: Hey, Mom, the school janitor said that Dad's working for the bad
  guys. And he said it through a hole in his throat.
  Lois: Well, That doesn't make him right.
  Chris: If I had a hole in my throat, I'd put pennies in it!
  Lois: Listen, your father's doing great work, and life's never been
  better.
  Stewie: Yes, I, too, applaud the oaf for finally showing some
  initiative. God knows he was years overdue.
  [Stewie lights a cigarette]
  Lois: [Gasps]
  Stewie: You know who I saw at the market today? Patty Croft. Oh, and
  she has gotten fat!
  Lois: Oh, my God! Stewie, no! Oh, God. What have I done? I knew smoking
  was bad, but I still sold my soul. And for what? Martha Stewart? Come
  on, kids. We gotta put a stop to this. Now!
  Martha Stewart: [Sighs] Finally. [Farting]
  [Schoolhouse Rock music]
  Bill: ? They call me Bill, yes, they call me Bill ? ? And I'm standing
  here on Capitol... ? [screams]
  Bob Dole Bob Dole's a friend of the tobacco industry. Bob Dole likes
  your style. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole.
  Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole....
  Lois: There you are! Peter, I caught Stewie smoking. That cigarette
  company is evil. We can't be a part of this anymore.
  Peter: Lois, this is the best job I ever had! Hey, since I became
  president, profits have been higher than Alyssa Milano. [Laughs]
  [cut to Alyssa Milano in live action watching Family Guy]
  Alyssa Milano: What kind of cheap shot...Joel!
  Joel: I'm suing. I'm suing. I'm on it.
  Aide: Mr. Griffin, time for your speech.
  Lois: But, Peter, what about your son?
  Peter: So Stewie had a puff. He's old enough to make his own decisions.
  For God's sakes, Lois, he's 1. Cut the umbilical cord!
  [Applauding]
  Peter: Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am here today to talk about
  smoking.
  Lois: Please, Peter, do the right thing.
  Peter: I know a lot of you are already on my side. And for you
  naysayers, I have two strong words for you: come on! Come on!
  Congressmen: Okay, sure. All right. Done.
  Peter: Thank you, ladies and...
  Stewie: [Stewie coughing] Baby needs to suck ash! Baby needs to suck
  ash! Not "ass," you pervert. Save it for the interns.
  Peter: Is that a baby? Oh, my God! That's Stewie! Lois was right!
  Children under 4 shouldn't smoke! Look, I don't care about this stupid
  job anymore. Cigarettes are bad!
  Congressman: Mr. Griffin is right! Smoking is a horrible vice! It
  shortens life expectancy and pollutes our air. And according to recent
  polls, air is good.
  Congressman 2: Cigarettes killed my father and raped my mother!
  [Gasps]
  Congressman Frank: Gentlemen, I propose we send a message to tobacco
  companies everywhere by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company infinity
  billion dollars!
  Congressman 3: That's the spirit, Frank! But I think a real number
  might be more effective. All in favor of fining this evil tobacco giant
  $100 million, say "Aye"!
  Congressmen: Aye! Aye!
  Executive: But that'll bankrupt us!
  Peter: Oh, you mean the way you've morally bankrupted America?
  Congressmen: [Laughing]
  Peter: Thanks for that zinger, boys. Now, give me a snappy line to go
  out on.
  Writer: Actually, our lunch is here.
  Peter: [Stuttering] Well, that's my mama! [Laughing nervously]

Title: One if by Clam Two if by Sea

Theme Song
  [Scene: The Drunken Clam, 1977. Cleveland, Peter, and Quagmire are
  sitting at a table in 70s clothing. There is disco music playing.]
  Horace: Here you go, boys. (Passes the group some beers.)
  Peter: Thanks, Horace. So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid
  toy factory. I'm gonna go places. (Jabs his finger onto the table.)
  Cleveland: Oh, that's cool. (Quagmire bobs his head)
  [The Drunken Clam, 1984. Cleveland, Peter, and Quagmire are sitting at
  a table in 80s clothing. Muzaked version of "Every Breath You Take" by
  the Police is playing.]
  Horace: Here you go, boys. (Passes the group some beers.)
  Peter: Thanks, Horace. So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid
  toy factory. I'm gonna go places. (Jabs his finger onto the table.)
  Cleveland: Oh, that's fly. (Quagmire bobs his head)
  [The Drunken Clam, present day. Cleveland, Peter, Joe, and Quagmire are
  sitting at a table in their regular clothing. There is music playing.]
  Horace: Here you go, boys.
  Peter: Thanks, Horace. So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid
  toy factory. I'm gonna go places. (Jabs his finger onto the table.)
  Cleveland: Oh, you are living la vida loca. (Quagmire bobs his head.)
  Joe: Well, it's late. I better head home.
  Horace: What do you mean "home"? You guys live here.
  (all laughing)
  Quagmire: Yeah. Here's to the Drunken Clam, boys. Where they don't ask
  for proof of age,and neither do I. (All sip their beer)
  Cleveland: Quagmire, you forgot to say "oh."
  Quagmire: (looking around) Are you sure? I think--think I did. All
  right. Well, just to be safe, oh! (Does his signature thrust. Sudden
  cut to the bar's TV.)
  Diane Simmons: We interrupt this program to bring you a special
  bulletin on the approach of hurricane Norman.
  Tom Tucker: Here with an update is Greg, the weather mime.
  (Shows Greg making shivering motions. Cut back to Tom.)
  Tom Tucker: Okay, i-it's gonna be cold, very cold, and--and there's
  gonna be wind, and- (Shows Greg wiggling his fingers and bringing his
  hands down. (Implying rain.) Cut back to Tom.)-people's parents will
  throw fecal matter down on them from the rooftops! How awful! (Shows
  Greg glaring at Tom with clenched fists.) Oh, no. I'm sorry,
  that's--that's rain. Yes. It'll rain.
  (Cut to the hallway of the Griffin house. The lights are off. Lois is
  kneeling on the floor next to the children.)
  Lois: Remember,the number-one cause of injury during a hurricane is
  broken glass. So stay away from the windows. (Glares at Peter.) And
  Peter, put those away.
  (Shows Peter with many drinking glasses set on a table)
  Peter: Aw, come on, Lois. Just one more song. (Begins playing music
  with glasses)
  Chris: Mom, I'm afraid if I fall asleep, the hurricane's gonna sneak up
  on me and give me a vasectomy.
  Peter: Relax, Chris. Nothing bad ever happens when you're asleep. In
  fact, sometimes good things can happen.
  (Cut to a scene of Peter and Lois lying in bed together. Peter is
  sleeping.)
  Peter: Oh, Jeni. Jeni. (Lois opens her eyes.) Oh, yeah, Jeni, don't
  stop. (Lois sits up in bed and glares at Peter.) Oh, Richard Jeni, your
  HBO comedy specials have brought pleasure to millions. (Lois smiles,
  lies down and closes her eyes.) And what a sweet ass. (Lois snaps her
  eyes open.)
  (Cut to a scene of a priest standing outside a house, ushering women
  inside.)
  Priest: Right this way, everyone.
  Woman: Bless you for helping us, Father.
  Priest: It's God's wish, my dear. (Woman walks inside. The Priest takes
  off his mask to reveal that he's actually Quagmire.) (snickers) All
  right!
  (Cut to the news.)
  Diane Simmons: Well, hurricane Norman is beginning to pound Quahog. We
  now go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa for a look at how locals
  are dealing with the imminent disaster. Tricia? (Cut to a scene of
  Tricia Takanawa standing outside. Fierce winds are blowing.)
  Tricia Takanawa: Diane, I am here in- (Gets hit by a car that is being
  blown by the wind. Cut back to the news.)
  Diane Simmons: Thank you, Tricia. Stay tuned for further- (Gets hit by
  Greg the Weather Mime, who is being blown by the wind.)
  Cut to the outside of the Griffin house, after the hurricane is over.)
  Griffin Family: Ahh! Oh, what a mess!
  Meg: Look at that! (Points to a tree with a plank through it.)
  Brian: Wow!
  (Peter backs out from behind a car, screaming. He has a plank stuck
  through his stomach.)
  Peter: For the love of God, do something!
  Family: Oh, my God! Daddy! Daddy!
  Peter: Oh, God! Oh, God! Gotcha! (Pulls the plank off to reveal it's
  one of those arrow-through-the-head dealies. Family laughs.) See, kids,
  natural disasters have their lighter sides, too. You just have to be
  creative.
  Chris: Yeah, like my dead-rat marionette theater. (is shown holding two
  dead rats attached to strings, like puppets. Chris begins to make a
  "conversation" between the two rats.)
  Rat 1: "I'm so stressed. Life sure is a human race."
  (The family laughs)
  Stewie: Right, that's brilliant!
  (Cut to a scene of Peter, Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire in a car,
  looking at the wreckage.)
  Cleveland: Oh, my, look at all the damage.
  Peter: Oh, thank God the open air debris garden is still intact. (Shows
  the open air debris garden. Which is actually a bunch of trash.)
  Cleveland: Peter, look! (Points) The Clam! (Tires screeching as Peter
  brakes, Cleveland gets slammed into the windshield. They rush out of
  the car to see the wreckage of the Clam.)
  Peter: Ahh! This is horrible! (Quagmire gets all teary around this
  point.)
  Horace: (is carrying a suitcase) You think this is horrible, try losing
  a testicle in a knife fight with your mother!
  Joe: What about your bar?!
  Horace: It's not my bar anymore. I sold the place. Let someone else
  worry about hurricanes.
  Peter: Who'd buy a wrecked bar?
  Horace: The bar's not wrecked. (A bulldozer clears away the wreckage to
  reveal a new bar called "The Clam's Head Pub.")
  Together: All right!
  Peter: Oh, thank you, God.
  God: Don't mention it. (rides off on a white horse. Quagmire, Peter,
  Joe, and Cleveland rush into the new Clam.)
  Peter: Wait a minute. Something's different. (orchestral music playing.
  Pans around the room to show British men dressed in suits, and bowlers,
  and all that jazz.)
  British bartender: Evening, gents. How about a nice, warm lager?
  British Man: And help yourself to a packet of crisps.
  British Man 2: Or a ruddy nice plum pudding.
  Peter: Holy crap! It's a gay bar! (Cleveland stares at Peter)
  [Rule Britannia playing]
  Joe: They turned the Drunken Clam into a British pub!
  Peter: Oh, well, at least they still got sports on TV. (Walks over to
  the TV.)
  Announcer: The new bowler for Somerset is our Spinner Heath who has a
  cover point long on square leg deep extra cover on two short legs.
  Peter: What the hell is he talking about?
  British Guy: Oh, it's cricket. Marvelous game, really. You see, the
  bowler hurls the ball towards the batter, who tries to play away a fine
  leg. He endeavors to score by dashing between the creases, provided the
  wicket keeper hasn't whipped his bails off, of course.
  Peter:Anybody get that?
  Cleveland: The only British idiom I know is that "fag" means
  "cigarette."
  Peter: Well, someone tell this cigarette to shut up. (Quagmire rushes
  in from the bathroom, holding a book.)
  Quagmire: Hey, guys! Th-there's no more girlie magazines in the can!
  All they got is this--this David Copperfield! (Displays the book.)
  Peter: W-w-wait, any pictures of his girlfriend? (Quagmire flips
  frantically through the pages.)
  Quagmire: No! No pictures at all!
  [All gasp. Cleveland crosses his eyes.]
  Cleveland: I think we should go.
  Peter': Yes. This is a dark and evil place. (All back out slowly. Cut
  to two British Guys sitting in the pub.)
  British Guy: I say, Caruthers.
  'Caruthers: Hmm.
  British Guy: Do you know what's very, very, funny? (pause) A man
  dressed in women's clothing.
  Caruthers: Hmm, yes, quite. Ripping good laugh.
  British Guy: Yes.
  Caruthers: Hmm.
  [Scene: The inside of the Griffin house. Peter bursts through the door.]
  Peter: Lois, the Drunken Clam's been taken over by a bunch of lousy,
  limey, tea-sucking British bastards!
  Lois: Peter!
  Nigel: Hello, Nigel Pinchley here. I was just introducing myself to
  your wife, who I must say is an absolutely gorgeous bit of crumpet.
  (Nigel and Lois start laughing. Nigel looks over Lois. )
  Peter: Holy crap! You're one of them!
  Lois: Peter! Nigel and his daughter are our new neighbors.
  Nigel: Yes, and I'm afraid I'm the "limey bastard" who has purchased
  your bar. Bit of an awkward moment, really.
  Peter: Awkward moment? I'll give you an awkward moment. One time during
  sex, I called Lois "Frank." Your move, Sherlock. (Nigel stares at Lois,
  and Lois looks shocked. And embarressed.)
  Lois: Peter! (To Nigel) Excuse us. (Ushers Peter out of the room.) Why
  are you acting like this? Nigel's charming. All British men are.
  Peter: Yeah, right. That's what they said about Benjamin Disraeli. (Cut
  to a scene of Benjamin Disraeli sitting at a desk)
  Benjamin Disraeli: You don't even know who I am. (Cut back to Lois and
  Peter)
  Lois: The British are a lovely people. Not physically, of course, but
  inside. And Nigel has a very sweet little daughter.
  (Scene: Outside the Griffin House. Stewie is sitting at a small table.
  A girl approaches.)
  Eliza: (cockney accent) Aw, look at the little baby!
  Stewie: Ahh! What the devil is that ghastly noise?
  Eliza: It's me! Eliza Pinchley. You want a flower, little baby? (offers
  a flower to Stewie)
  Stewie: Excuse me. What I think you mean to say is,"Would I like a
  flower?" Heavens! You don't so much speak the language as chew on it
  and spit it out!
  Eliza: Go on. What's wrong with the way I talk?
  Stewie: [shuddering] Everything. Look, here's a shiny sixpence if you
  keep your mouth shut and go away. (Tosses the coin on the ground. Eliza
  turns and bends down to pick it up. Stewie glances at her butt.) Eh!
  (Back to Lois and Peter)
  Lois: Honey, I know the Drunken Clam was your bar. But maybe you and
  your friends can find somewhere else to act like idiots.
  Peter: Yeah, I guess you're right. You know why I married you, Lois?
  It's not just the rack, or the caboose. It's that big, sexy brain of
  yours. (Begins licking Lois's head. Both are laughing.)
  (Cut to a scene of the gang entering a purple club called the Cherry
  Pit. They stand in the doorway.)
  Peter: All right, this place isn't bad.
  Joe: Oh yeah. Good music, real sports on the tube.
  Quagmire: I've never seen so many chicks in one place. Hey, hey. Check
  out those two hotties.(snickering) They're so lonely, they're
  practicing kissing each other.
  Cleveland: I don't think they're practicing.
  All: (Dissapointed) Oh. (Happier) Oh! (Uh, delighted?) Ah! (Realization
  setting in.)Oh. (All turn to leave, except Quagmire. He walks over to
  the two hotties mentioned earlier. And he bobs his head a bit.)
  Quagmire: So, you ladies ever been penetrated? (He gets forcefully
  thrown out of the club. Ow.)
  (Go to a scene of Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire standing in front
  of a fence, King of the Hill style.)
  Quagmire: Yup.
  Peter: Yup.
  Joe: Yup.
  Cleveland?: Mmm-hmm.
  [Across the street a large red double-decker bus stops in front of the
  Clam's Head Pub. A lot of people get out and walk into the pub.]
  Woman: Hope the loo is working.
  Quagmire: Ah, this sucks. Nice choice for a hangout, Peter. There's not
  even anywhere to sit down!
  Joe: Is that some kinda crack?
  Peter: What do you mean crack, are you saying I got a fat ass?
  Cleveland: Fellas, fellas, what's become of us? We never squabbled
  before we lost the Clam.
  Quagmire: Yeah, you're right! It's those lousy fog breathers!
  Peter: Damn British! First they took our bar, now they're taking our
  friendship! What's next, apple pie, fast cars, and action films?
  (Cut to the beginning of a movie. The names Schwarzenegger and
  Sylvester Stallone come down in a stereotypical action film way. You
  know what I mean. The screen clears to pan over a lake. The title 'I
  Remember Cecil' appears slowly on the screen in cursive. It then shows
  Sly and Arnold in a boat on the lake. Stallone is trailing his hand in
  the water.)
  Schwarzenegger: (voiceover) It was a glorious summer in Oxford when I
  met Freddy Cavendish, a most remarkable young man, whose friendship
  would change my life forever.
  Sylvester Stallone: (Leans back in the boat) You are the anchor that
  gives my spirit license to soar.
  (Cut back to the guys)
  Joe: Our forefathers wouldn't have taken it on the chin like this.
  Peter: You're damn right. I say we fight the British and drive them
  back to whatever country they came from!
  (All begin cheering and raising their beers in the air and whatnot.]
  Cleveland: We gonna get 'em.
  (Cut back to the Griffin house. Stewie is on the floor and Brian is
  reading a book. Lois comes over.)
  Lois: Stewie, look. It's an invitation to little Eliza's birthday party!
  Stewie: You mean that horrid girl who talks like a scullery maid? I
  didn't realize she'd been born. I assumed she'd simply congealed in a
  gutter somewhere. (Lois chuckles.)
  Lois: Ooh, i'm gonna r.s.v.p. right now! (Walks off)
  Stewie: Oh, splendid. An entire afternoon of her "ers," and "ars," and
  "'alf a pound of ha'penny rice." God, why can't the English teach their
  children how to speak?
  Brian: (Looks up from reading.) Why don't you teach her? Unless you
  don't think you're up to it.
  Stewie: (Mockingly) Oh, yes, this is the part where I'm supposed to
  say, "Oh, I am so up to it". (Begins laughing, then abruptly stops and
  points accusingly at Brian.) Well, I am! I accept your challenge! At
  the celebration of her birthday, I shall pass that guttersnipe off as a
  lady! What are the stakes of this wager?
  Brian: Why don't you shut up for about a week?
  Stewie: Very well. And if I win?
  Brian: Well, I--I wasn't betting. (Gets up from chair.)Why don't you
  just shut up for about a week? (Walks off)
  Stewie: You're on!
  (Shows Peter, Joe, Cleveland and Quagmire dressed in colonial clothing.
  They enter the doorway of the Clam's Head Pub. Quagmire is holding a
  flag, Cleveland is drumming, Peter is playing the fife.))
  Peter: Minutemen, present arms! (They each hold up a beer) Load
  weapons! (They all begin shaking their beers and chanting)
  All: Boom-shaka-laka-laka! Boom-shaka-laka-laka! Boom-shaka-laka-laka!
  Peter: Fire! (They open their beers and let it splash all over the
  English customers.)
  Various British: Oh, I say! Throw the blackguards out!
  Nigel: Gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave!
  Cleveland: Don't tread on me!
  Peter: Yeah, back off! We kicked your ass in World War II, and we can
  do it again!
  Nigel: Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably, I'm afraid we'll
  have to useour superior linguistic skills to convince you to leave.
  Peter: Oh, yeah? Just try it!
  All: Bye, now.
  Cleveland:Thanks.
  Joe: Sorry to bother you.
  Quagmire: I never saw it that way before. Wait, how the hell did they
  do that?
  Peter:Well, we're not gonna let this stop us. I've never been defeated,
  except once.
  [Peter is in the cycle race sequence from Tron]
  [Electronic sound effects]
  Peter: Eric?
  Eric: Peter!
  Peter: Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since high school. God! What are
  you doing these days?
  Eric: I'm the red guy.
  Peter: Oh my God.
  Eric: What are you doing?
  Peter: I'm the green guy.
  Eric: No kidding?
  Peter: Yeah.
  Eric: Hey, is that Stacy Beecham?
  Peter: Where?
  [Eric cuts off Peter's light cycle]
  [cut to Quahog Harbor]
  [Mysterious instrumental music]
  Peter: Now, don't worry. These guys are trained to stay perfectly
  still. Check it out. Hey, Margaret Thatcher...what the hell? I thought
  you English guys never moved.
  Sentry: No. That's just our women. [both laughing] Bloody hell! My
  lunch was in that hat! Egg and chips with jam booties!
  Joe: Welcome to the Quahog Beer Party!
  Cleveland: I do feel a little guilty about pollutin'.
  Quagmire: I felt guilty once, but she woke up halfway through.
  Cleveland: Peter, what are you doing?
  Peter: Hey, it may taste like a warm cup of tobacco chewers' spit but
  it's still beer, damn it.
  Quagmire: Good point. Bottoms up!
  Peter: Take that, you lousy Brits!
  Lois: Peter, we waited up all night. Where were you?
  Peter: Where was I? Where were you?
  Lois: Out drinking. But I was back by 2:00.
  Brian: Oh, no!
  Tom Tucker: Our top story: the Clam's Head Pub has burned to the
  ground. Our own Tricia Takanawa is on the scene.
  Tricia Takanawa: Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist? Police say
  no, but our producer says yes. Here's an artist's depiction of what the
  arsonist might look like. [sketch of a giant, fire-breathing insect]
  Anyone with information about this suspect should contact Quahog police
  immediately. One thing is certain-the pain here is palpable. For many,
  this charred portrait of Elizabeth II gives poignant new meaning to the
  phrase, "Hey, check out that flaming queen."
  Tom Tucker: In a late-breaking development, the police have a new
  suspect. We now go live to Hispanic reporter, Maria... [Stuttering]
  Diane Simmons: Jimenez.
  Tom Tucker: I know what it is.
  Maria Jimenez: Well, Tom, at this moment we're approaching the
  suspect's house.
  Peter: Ah, this is better than Cops. You know there's a fat drunk guy
  in there.
  Cop 1: Hold it!
  Cop 2: Freeze!
  Peter: There he is.
  Cop 2: Hands up, Griffin! You're coming with us.
  Peter: Hang on, hang on, I want to see what they do with this jackass.
  Cop 2: Hands up!
  Lois: Oh, my God! Peter, you didn't!
  Peter: Hey, fatty's wife is a babe!
  Cop 2: That's it!
  Maria Jimenez: Well, Tom, it appears the real arsonist is in custody
  thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities.
  Giant Bug: Good. Good.
  Peter: The fat guy's struggling. Hit him, you stupid pigs, hit him! Use
  the billy...
  [Solemn instrumental music]
  Judge: This Quahog Minutemen flag was found at the wreckage of the
  Clam's Head. You are clearly guilty of arson, so you are free to go...
  straight to jail! Now you got burned! No bail!
  Lois: Peter, tell me you didn't do this.
  Peter: Lois, I didn't do it! You know you can trust me, right? Come on,
  let's sit down and talk about this.
  Lois: I want to believe you, but...
  Peter: Gotcha! But seriously, you can trust me.
  Nigel: Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry this terrible tragedy has befallen you.
  Lois: Thank you, Nigel. You're very kind.
  Nigel: Can I touch your bum once?
  Lois: What?
  Nigel: Now I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday, and I won't take no
  for an answer unless the question is, "Do you not like me?" Get it?
  Double negative, you know? Very good. Yes.
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Inmate 1: Hey, check out the new meat!
  Inmate 2: I like the fat one. More cushion for the pushin'.
  Peter: Thank you!
  Inmate 3: You and me gonna have a good time together!
  Peter: Gosh, everybody's so nice here. I mean, they're gonna be
  disappointed when they find out I'm not gay, but wow!
  Joe: Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most vicious killer I ever
  put away. His name's Steve Bellows. He's so mean, he once shot a man
  for snoring.
  Quagmire: Where have I heard that before?
  Joe: It's all in this simulated leather-bound edition of Time-Life's
  "Killers of Quahog."
  Peter: Wow. They're all here. John the Biter, the Berserk Hobo, the
  Golden Autumn Day Strangler.
  Cleveland: Maybe Steve won't remember you.
  [Ominous instrumental music]
  Steve Bellows: Well, well, Officer Swanson. You and your friends are
  dead! You're all dead!
  Peter: Oh, good. He thinks we're zombies. He'll leave us alone.
  Stewie: No, no, no! If you're ever going to be a lady, you must learn
  to speak like one. Now try it again. "The life of the wife is ended by
  the knife."
  Eliza: "The loif of the w..."
  Stewie: No, no, no. Not "loif," "life!" "Life!"
  Eliza: That's wha' I said! "Loif!"
  Stewie: Now listen to me, you tin-eared piece of baggage, we've got
  five days left, and I'll not lose my wager. Now repeat after me.
  "Hello, Mother. Have you hidden my hatchet?"
  Eliza: 'Allo, Mother. 'Ave you 'idden my 'atchet?"
  Stewie: God, no! It's an "H" sound, you moron! H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
  Eliza: Ooh, your breath smells like kitty litter!
  Stewie: I was curious!
  Bonnie: Our husbands couldn't have done this.
  Loretta: Yeah. Cleveland can't even light the damn hibachi on the
  Fourth of July!
  Insurance Agent: Excuse me. Do you know where I can find Nigel
  Pinchley? I'm from Quahog Insurance, and I have a check for him.
  Loretta: $5 million?
  Insurance Agent: Yeah, lucky fella took out a huge policy the day
  before the fire.
  Lois: Doesn't that strike you as a little suspicious?
  Insurance Agent: No, not really. In fact, it seems to happen all the
  time.
  Quagmire: Oh, no! Here comes Steve!
  Steve Bellows: I haven't forgot about you boys! Saturday night at
  midnight, you're dead! All of you are dead!
  Peter: Midnight on Saturday? Thank God! We can still be in the talent
  show! From the top, boys. Five, six, seven, eight!
  [Jazz instrumental music] [the guys do a Cabaret-style dance]
  Stewie: Once again, here is how it should sound. "How do you do?" And
  here is how you sound: [Can moos] Now try it again.
  Eliza: "How do you do?"
  Stewie: What did you say?
  Eliza: "The life of the wife is ended by the knife."
  Stewie: I think she's got it! I think she's got it!
  Eliza: ? "The life of the wife is ended by the knife" ?
  Stewie: By George, she's got it! By George, she's got it! Now, what
  ends her wretched life?
  Eliza: ? The knife! The knife! ?
  Stewie: And where's that bloody knife?
  Eliza: ? In the wife! In the wife! ?
  Both: ? The life of the wife is ended by the knife ?
  Stewie: Bravo, Eliza!
  Both: ? The life of the wife is ended by the knife ?
  Nigel: Hello. So nice to see you.
  Lois: There he is. All right, we need to search the house for evidence.
  But one of us is gonna have to distract Nigel. Oh, no, no, no, I
  couldn't. Well, what about Loretta? Nigel looks like he's down with the
  swirl.
  Nigel: Oh, there you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand tour and
  show you my private quarters?
  Lois: - I'd love to.
  Nigel: I must say, you look absolutely...[Muttering] Oh, don't be shy,
  my lambie-lamb. This is my study where I... study things that arouse my
  interest.
  Lois: [Thinking] Good, the girls are in place. [aloud] Oh, Nigel, since
  Peter's been gone, I've been searching for someone new. You know,
  someone with a sense of danger and adventure.
  Nigel: I once played a game of cricket without shin guards.
  Lois: Oh, I love a reckless man!
  Nigel: One time, I went up to this bloke's flat, rang the bell, and ran
  like Sebastian Coe!
  Lois: More! Tell me more!
  Nigel: I burned down my pub for the insurance money and framed your
  husband!
  Lois: I knew it! And what's more, I have witnesses! Bonnie! Loretta?
  Demond Wilson from Sanford and Son? What are you doing here?
  Demond Wilson: I know. I'm surprised I'm alive, too.
  Nigel: Sorry, love. Better luck next time.
  Insurance Agent: Mr. Pinchley, I heard everything! What you've done is
  a textbook example of insurance "fraud"!
  Nigel: Oh, bloody hell! What the devil were you doing in the closet
  anyway?
  Insurance Agent: I came with Demond.
  Butler: Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Eliza Pinchley.
  Stewie: Psst! You-Dogbert! Down here! Get a front-row seat for this one.
  [Sweet instrumental music]
  Eliza: How kind of you all to come.
  Stewie: Magnificent! I say, old sport, why don't you pull your face
  from your own loins and bury it into some humble pie?
  Eliza: Oh, bloody 'ell! I've gone and wet meself!
  Stewie: Don't give me that smug look! Fine! Well, you have
  extra-sensitive hearing. Hear this.
  [Inaudible]
  Brian: I'm telling.
  Stewie: No! I said "vacuum"!
  Quagmire: Hurry, Peter! Steve's gonna be here in five minutes!
  Peter: Aw, crap! We're dead!
  Quagmire: I guess this is the end, boys.
  Joe: Looks like our next stop is a corner booth in a bar in Heaven!
  Lois: Peter, Nigel confessed! You're free!
  Peter: You hear that, guys? We're free!
  [Cheering]
  All: All right! Yeah! Freedom!
  Steve Bellows: Get ready to die! Oh. Huh. Wonder what this feels like.
  [stabs self] [Shouts] That hurts! My God, is that what I've been doing
  to people? I belong here.
  [Upbeat instrumental music]
  [Crowd cheering]
  Peter: Ah, Horace, I never thought I'd see you and the Clam again.
  Horace: Ah, Florida stunk. An alligator mounted me when I wasn't
  looking and laid eggs in my lower intestine. But you're all thirsty.
  I'll bore you another time.
  Peter: Here's to our wives. They may not be as hot as the women you see
  on TV, or as entertaining...but, um.... You know, I don't know where
  I'm going with this, but thanks anyway.
  Lois: I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson. Whatever he gets is
  too good for him.
  [Thunder crashing] [Nigel is put to death by hanging]
  Eliza: Dear Stewie, I want you to know I blame my father's death and my
  incarceration in this hell hole entirely on your awful mother. If it
  takes the rest of my life, I shall see that she suffers a slow and
  painful death. Eliza.
  Stewie: [Laughing] Excellent. Here, have a look.
  Giant Bug: Good, good.
  [closing theme music]



Title: And the Wiener is

"It seems today that all you see
  "Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  "But where are those good old-fashioned values
  "On which we used to rely?
  "Lucky there's a family guy
  "Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
  "Laugh and cry
  "He's a family guy
  Look, I'm that pretty dark-haired figure skater with the horse teeth,
  the one who got what she had coming.
  Nice figure eight, Mom.
  Ha! All right!
  OK, Bonnie. One, two, three, push!
  Oh! Ah! Whoa!
  My God! I can walk! It's a mira...!
  - Sorry, Dad. - Just get the chair.
  Good shot. Made my brown eye blue with that one.
  - Yeah. Next one's coming for your head! - Oh, no! No, help! Oh, help!
  - What the hell? - Now is the winter of your discontent!
  You wanna race? On your mark, get set, go!
  First to where that Pakistani girl fell through the ice
  after coming to the States for her severely burned face
  she got when the man she refused to marry dumped sulphuric acid on her,
  wins. I win!
  Yes! Yes! In your face! In your face!
  In my face! In my face!
  Ahh! No! Acid girl! It's acid girl! Ahh!
  - James Woods High! Whoo! - Hey, guys.
  - What do you want? - I'm trying out for cheerleading.
  Peter Rabbit would be wise to stay out of Mr McGregor's garden.
  Why don't you try the flag girls squad?
  Are you trying out for flag girl?
  Yes! I win again, Andy.
  One more before the missus notices I'm not on the couch.
  Too late!
  Hey, careful, Quagmire. Don't get too close to that thing.
  Did I just get laid?
  - Nice game, Peter. - I'm on a roll.
  - I whipped Chris on the ice today. - Enjoy it while it lasts.
  It's only a matter of time before he beats you.
  What? I'm better than him at everything: Sports, video games, even
  magic tricks.
  - Ha-ha. Got your nose. - Oh, yeah? Well, I got your face.
  Calm down, Chris. It's only a trick.
  Face it, sooner or later you'll have to pass the torch.
  I remember the first time Kevin beat me. I was so proud,
  I gave him a little congratulatory punch in the arm. Then another.
  Then everything got hazy. Kevin went to live with a foster family for a
  while...
  - It's inevitable. - Don't feel bad.
  I think I know why your son beat you.
  Apparently, you're a 12-year-old prepubescent girl.
  Which is good, cos I finally have someone to give this training bra to.
  Here, Josephina.
  Does it feel good on your new budding bosoms?
  - It sure does... - Get the hell off me!
  Rudolph, we figured out what makes your nose red.
  - Is it pixie dust or leprechaun tails? - No, it's a tumour.
  You mean like a magical Christmas tumour?
  No, a malignant tumour, the base of which is lodged deep within your
  brain.
  - Oh. Like a happy special... - You're going to die.
  Hey, everybody, guess what I am.
  The end result of a drunken backseat gropefest and a broken
  prophylactic?
  - I'm on the flag girl squad! - Oh, honey, congratulations.
  - Hey, Chris. I bet you can't do this. - I bet I can!
  We perform at all the football games. I'm practically a cheerleader!
  That's wonderful. Isn't that wonderful?
  Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see your fork and raise you a gravy
  ladle.
  You're on!
  So, you're a flag girl. That's great, Meg.
  Yes, yes.
  Now you can be somewhere else when the boys don't call.
  - All right. Salt shaker up the nose. - I got pepper.
  Ha-ha! Yes! I win!
  - That was fun, Dad! - I'm the man!
  Yeah! Ahh!
  Lois, go get the medical dictionary and look up "fork" and "lung. "
  - Why? - Time's a factor, Lois.
  Say, Meg, looking sharp. You want to go out after the game tonight?
  Neil, I'm a flag girl now. I'm way too cool to be seen with you.
  Really? Not even if I smoke this corncob pipe?
  Are we all ready to cheer at the game tonight?
  "We?" Oh, you made flag girl, huh?
  Yeah. This morning my mom was, like, "Don't forget your lunch",
  and I'm all "I'm a flag girl now, I won't forget my lunch",
  and she's all "Don't forget your halftime routine. "
  Moms! Hey, maybe we could all, like, hang out after the game.
  Go, team!
  Uncool people are like animals.
  You want to go feed the science club after school?
  Look at me.
  Look at me, I'm smoking. Dog, dog, look, look...
  Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer. It constricts the blood
  vessels...
  - Shut up. - The dog just told me to shut up.
  I demand to know what you plan to do about this. Hey!
  - Hey! The dog just told me... - Be quiet, Stewie.
  - Freezing my nips off out here. - Oh, look, there's Meg.
  Meg! Meg! Meg!
  - Hi, Meg. - Hi, Meg.
  Here we go.
  - Isn't she beautiful? - Yeah, but I think she's with that guy.
  - They've held hands all night. - I mean Meg.
  Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's hot.
  - Oh! This meat stinks something fierce! - This'll knock her down a
  couple notches.
  Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how these kids celebrate these days!
  What do you got? What do you got? Huh? Huh? Come on.
  - Come on, ref. That's charging. - Your feet were moving. No foul.
  No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call! And I know something about stupid
  calls.
  Hello?
  I can't take out the garbage. I'm at the office and they're making me
  stay late.
  Caller ID says you're calling from the kitchen.
  - In fact, I can see you. - Can you see me now?
  - No. - Now I'm at the office.
  Score's tied, next basket wins. You might finally beat your old man.
  "Old man"? I'm the white Larry Bird.
  What do you got? What do you got? Huh? Come on!
  - Your mother and I are getting a divorce! - You are?
  Yes! Yes! Oh, no, we worked it out.
  Yes!
  Son, you played good, but your dad is still number one.
  - Yeah, I don't think I'll ever beat you. - Hey, Chris, what's with
  your leg?
  Oh, my God! That's not your leg!
  - What's wrong, honey? - I'll tell you:
  I try to make love to you and you think about Chris.
  - Is there something you need to tell me? - Thanks to you, our son has
  a huge wang.
  - Thanks to me? - He didn't get it from me.
  - What are you talking about? - I'll show you.
  All right, stand back, Lois.
  Oh, my. No wonder he's always slouching.
  How did this happen? I'm supposed to be the man of the house.
  - You must be ashamed of me. - Oh, Peter.
  I care as much about the size of your penis as you care about the size
  of my breasts.
  Oh, my God!
  You can't let those awful kids get to you.
  They won't. I'm never going back to that school again.
  - Dad, could you help me with my algebra? - You're a big man. You
  figure it out.
  I bet there's a part of you that wants to be friends with them.
  - Maybe. - So be nice to them.
  Win your enemies over with unflappable kindness.
  - Chris, drink your milk. It'll make you big. - No! No more milk for
  him.
  He's had enough. Give me that.
  Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it in the manner to which
  you're accustomed.
  Oh!
  Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart. I know what it takes to be cool.
  Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.
  - Hi, you guys. - God, it's her.
  - Look, about the other night... - Oh, that was hilarious.
  I just wish I'd known ahead of time. I would've brought potato salad!
  You guys want tomorrow's biology test?
  - Whoa! How'd you get that? - I spent the night with Mr Burler.
  Ah, the sun's up. I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.
  - Wow, thanks! - See ya.
  - That was kinda cool. - Yeah.
  I'm bored.
  Wanna go push the janitor, knowing he can't legally push us back?
  - Sure! - OK, cool. Let's go do it.
  Hey, Dad. Look at these little bananas.
  Why, you smug little bastard!
  Peter! Chris, these are plantains. And there's nothing wrong with them.
  In fact, a lot of women prefer them to normal-size bananas,
  because they're exotic and flavourful and very, very special.
  Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring for the plantain section.
  Stop with this!
  You're overreacting to this Chris stuff.
  I mean, mine goes inside me when I stand up. How do you think I feel?
  - Is Dad mad at me? - Oh, of course not, honey.
  Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me at the ten-inches-or-less line.
  Items!
  Nice, huh? Huh? Yeah. You like this?
  Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me. Look, I know you're upset,
  but...
  - Oh, my God. Where's Stewie? - He's around.
  Let me out of this stink-filled corduroy dungeon!
  - Peter, that's sick! - It's OK. He's outside the underwear.
  - Enjoy your new car, Mr Griffin. - Thanks, Jim.
  When you pull that thing into your garage, does the garage say "Is it
  in yet?"
  Don't worry, baby. I'll be gentle.
  Ow. My pride.
  You were right. I was nice to the cool kids and they didn't spit on me.
  Connie Demico even invited me to her sweet 16.
  Wonderful! What time do we nail those snot-nosed punks?!
  Nail them? You told me to win them over with kindness.
  Yes. Now that they think you're their friend, it's the perfect time to
  exact your revenge.
  Revenge?
  I'm like one of those bald eagles you see on the Discovery Channel:
  Beautiful to look at, but mess with one of my chicks
  and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip your eyes out! Cookies are
  done.
  - Who wants chocolate-chip? - I do!
  But keep talking. All this stuff about eye-gouging has gotten me all
  frisky.
  Really. I've got about half a pack of Rolaids in my diaper.
  I'm glad you want to join the National Gun Association.
  Let me show you around. This is our shooting range.
  Here we have our locker room with full shower facilities.
  Holy crap! They're all so... small!
  You see, Peter, the way we look at it, a man's only as big as the gun
  he carries.
  Sign me up, and get me the biggest freakin' gun you got!
  - Stewie, you can come out now. - Turn off the light. I'm reading a
  ghost story.
  Pull!
  Oh, yeah. Who's the big man now, huh?
  - Madonna or Janet Jackson? - Which Janet?
  - Velvet Rope. - Yeah, that one. Pull!
  - What the hell are you doing with that? - You want to touch it? Go on.
  Careful. We don't want it to get too excited and go off in your hand.
  This is pathetic. All because you feel inadequate next to Chris.
  Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete with my son or his freakishly
  large penis.
  - I'm a freak. - Don't despair.
  Let's hang a tyre on the end of it and head on down to the ol' swimming
  hole.
  Connie Demico's house is two storeys. If we set up booby traps here,
  here...
  - How'd you get these blueprints? - Oh, your mother has her ways.
  She has her ways.
  - Can I have those blueprints? - Sure, here you go.
  Now I've put together a little flash bomb to create a diversion.
  I used to date the pyro guy from Whitesnake.
  What's Whitesnake?
  That's the music mommies and daddies listen to. Fire in the hole!
  Some guys from the club are going hunting tomorrow.
  - Count me in. - Hunting?
  - You were gonna play hockey with Chris. - Bring him along.
  - Oh, no. It's too dangerous. - Lois, Lois.
  The National Gun Association is all about safety, especially when it
  comes to kids.
  Take a look at our new video.
  Let's face it, your kids will get into your guns. That's a fact.
  Gun accidents can be avoided by introducing your children to guns early.
  Hi! I'm Petey the pistol. Say, do you ever get lonely?
  - Yes. - Me, too. Hold me.
  If you squeeze me, I make bad people go away.
  But wait a minute. I thought guns were bad.
  False! Guns are good.
  In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses used guns to conquer the
  Romans?
  So remember: Guns don't kill people, dangerous minorities do.
  See, Lois? They're responsible.
  Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris. I can write my name in the snow.
  - This is fun, Dad. - Son, son, I told you.
  Out here in the wilderness, call me Rooster Cogburn.
  I was starting to think you didn't like me any more.
  Shh. Chris, look! Tracks. There must be a deer around here.
  - Those are snowmobile tracks. - Shh! There he is.
  Such grace. That's the thing about hunting - you gotta be patient.
  What the hell was that?!
  Put this in the heating grate and set it off in five minutes.
  I changed my mind. I won't do it.
  - They're my friends now. - They pelted you with meat.
  Did you forget the neighbour kids chased you and sprinkled you with
  fixings?
  Yes, I did!
  OK. Now we're gonna play Seven Minutes in Heaven,
  and it's my party, so I want Doug to go in the closet with... Meg.
  Have fun.
  OK. Everyone get ready. Say hello to the lovers.
  I don't know who should be more humiliated, Meg or the pig.
  - She's such a dork. - I think I feel worse for the pig.
  Mom, you were right! I should have just stuck to the plan!
  I figured you might get soft on me, so I hired an old friend to scar
  them for life.
  - Hey there, sweetie. How old are you? - 16.
  - 18?! You're first. - Mom!
  I like where this is going. Giggidy-giggidy-good-goody.
  Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear. Say hello to Satan for me!
  It's a boy, Mrs Griffin.
  I'm afraid the fever has affected his motor skills.
  He's gonna have to repeat the fourth grade.
  Looks like he'll have to repeat the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.
  The only way to get rid of them is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.
  Congratulations. You've passed the fourth grade.
  Great. I gotta leave though. I'm going hunting with my son.
  Dad, I know what to do! I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!
  Go away! Go on, get! Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!
  Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing. I mean, I just froze up.
  But you handled that bear like a real man. I'm proud of you, son.
  You are? Because I heard what you said about my huge... you know.
  Oh. Oh, you heard that, huh?
  I was just being stupid. Take it from me, that thing you got there is a
  blessing.
  I mean, every guy you see with a big house or a fancy car or a shiny
  gold tooth
  is really just saying "Don't look at my penis. "
  - But you'll never have to worry about that. - Thanks, Dad! You're the
  best.
  You know, Dad, I just realised something. Your name's Peter.
  You're right, it is.
  Peter.

Title: Death Lives

Theme Song
  [News bulletin music]
  Diane Simmons: A tragic accident today in the north Providence area. A
  family of four lost their lives when their minivan swerved off the road
  and into a ravine, exploding on impact.
  Tom Tucker: [Snickering]
  Diane Simmons: Do you find this funny, Tom?
  Tom Tucker: No, no, no. I was remembering, I accidentally put my shirt
  on inside out this morning. It's fine now, though. So, so, what were
  you saying? A fashion show?
  Meg: Chris, turn the TV off. We gotta find an anniversary gift for Mom
  and Dad.
  Chris: Don't look! We're shopping! We're shopping!
  Lois: Oh, kids, you don't need to do anything special for our
  anniversary. Just your father.
  Meg: I hope he doesn't wait and get your gift at the last minute again.
  [flashback to family in kitchen]
  Lois: My goodness! A human thumb. Where did you ever find this?
  Peter: It was on eBay. [vomiting] Oh, God! Call an ambulance!
  Lois: This year, instead of exchanging gifts, I told him it would be
  nice if we could just spend a romantic day together.
  Stewie: Oh, dear! I think we all know what that means. [Imitating
  springs] Gross.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Cleveland: Hey, fellas! Guess what? I got us a tee time tomorrow at
  Barrington Country Club.
  Cleveland: Barrington? Wow!
  Peter: I'm in.
  Brian: Uh, Peter, tomorrow's your anniversary.
  Peter: Aw, crap! If Lois finds out I'm ditching her to play golf,
  she'll hit me with a frying pan...which is why I'm gonna drink this
  frying-pan antidote. All right, hit me with this. Didn't work.
  [Birds singing]
  Lois: What the hell? <reading aloud> "Lois, it's an
  anniversary scavenger hunt. "Your first clue is at the Quahog
  Mini-Mart. Love, Peter." Oh, how fun!
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Man: All right, gentlemen, before you tee off, here are your
  complimentary monogrammed bag towels, a sleeve of balls, and this
  mobile ball cleaner.
  Caddie: Clean as a whistle, sir.
  Peter: I'm not gonna get short by touching your spit, am I?
  Caddie: You'd be the first, champ.
  Peter: Well, it's about time.
  Cleveland: Sorry, fellas. I'm not gonna be able to play. Loretta's
  mother is in town, and we have to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.
  Loretta: Cleveland!
  Cleveland: I mean, the pullout sofa bed.
  Peter: Cleveland, this is Barrington. You could be the first black guy
  ever to play this course. People are gonna be impressed.
  Golfer 1: Hey, a black guy!
  Golfer 2: Fun!
  Loretta: Come on, Cleveland.
  Brian: Maybe we should play another time.
  Peter: Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois busy so I could be
  here. Now, let's grip it and rip it.
  Golfer: The Fed will be lowering rates, get your money out of T-bills
  and put it all into <hit by ball> waffles! Tasty waffles
  with lots of syrup!
  Broker: Waffles! Buy waffles!
  Brokers:Waffles! [All shouting]
  Lois: Okay, kids. Keep your eyes peeled for a clue.
  Stewie: Now what Jughead has done here, and it's really quite ingenious
  actually, is paint pupils on his eyelids, so he can sleep through class
  without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.
  Chris: He's sleeping.
  Meg: Mom, I found Dad's first clue.
  Lois: I can't believe your father organized this. Usually he can't even
  handle simple tasks.
  [flashback]
  Lois: Peter, why is there a diaper in the lamp socket?
  Stewie: Lois, he's done it again! Wait a minute. [Exclaims]
  Brian: Let's pack it in. There's too much water out here.
  Quagmire: Yeah. Let's hit the bar, huh?
  Peter: Come on. There's worse things in life than rain. Like uh, like
  spiders.
  Spider: He's behind the door!
  Lois: [Coughing] Peter, he's bothering everyone. Say something.
  Peter: Say something? I'll kick his ass. Someone ought to kick his ass.
  Spider: Don't go in there!
  Lois: Peter!
  Peter: All right. Give me a Kleenex.
  Spider: I knew he was bad. I knew...ah!
  Caddie: Out of me way! They're after me Lucky Charms!
  Quagmire: I paid him $10 to say it. Classic.
  Brian: We'll be in the clubhouse.
  Peter: Go on, run away! More golf course for me! That was close. That
  looks dangerous. Somebody's gonna get hurt. [straining] It'll be fine.
  [Magical instrumental music]
  BOTH: You again?
  [Mysterious instrumental music]
  Peter: Death, please, don't take me now.
  Death: DEATH: Relax. You're not dying. You're just having a near-death
  experience.
  Peter: Thank God!
  Death: Yeah, thank God. Thank God I get to hang out with a fascinating
  gent like yourself!
  Peter: So, when am I gonna die?
  Death: About two years after your wife divorces you.
  Peter: What the hell are you talking about? Lois would never leave me.
  She's been crazy about me since the night we met.
  [Sweet instrumental music]
  Peter: My God, that's me! Look how thin I was!
  Lois: My, this is certainly a beautiful night. I love looking at stars.
  Peter: Say no more.
  Lois: Peter, wait. I...
  Peter: "Very interesting. But stupid."
  Lois: Oh, my God! I love Arte Johnson!
  Peter: Why don't you give him a kiss?
  Lois: Peter, get away from me.
  Peter: Come on.
  Lois: Stop it.
  Peter: Give Arte Johnson a kiss.
  [Both laughing]
  [Peter Frampton's "Baby, I Love Your way" playing on radio]
  Trucker: Oh, my God!
  [Truck crashing]
  [Music continuing on radio]
  Lois: Peter, I hear music.
  Peter: Yeah. Me, too. From now on, this'll be our song.
  [Driver groaning]
  Lois: I've never met a guy like you. You're so full of life.
  [Driver screaming]
  Lois: It's like I can really be myself with you. I'm so happy.
  Peter: Man! She was beautiful.
  Death: Say, this looks awfully familiar. Wait a second! I remember
  this! That's me! Look at all that hair. I can't believe I thought that
  looked good. I must have been high.
  Peter: I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.
  Lois: I love you, Peter Griffin.
  Peter: Look at that. Huh, huh? There's no way she's gonna leave me. Now
  put me back in my freakin' body, all right?
  Death: I can't put you back until you have a revelation. You know, one
  of those things that changes your life.
  Peter: To hell with this. I'm going home.
  Death: What are you doing? You can't get in that way.
  Peter: I'm sure as hell not going in the back door.
  Death: Crap! I don't have time for this. Listen, I'm late for an
  appointment. If you don't want to follow procedure, fine. Stay here in
  limbo.
  Peter: No. Wait. I don't want to be in limbo!
  Lois: Okay. It says the next note will be right under my nose.
  Announcer: And they're off! And quick out in front, Silver Dasher,
  followed by My Nose!
  Lois: Aha! Hold my purse!
  [Dogs barking]
  Chris: What's Mom doing?
  Stewie: I'll tell you what she's doing, she's screwing up my six-two
  quinella. Damn it!
  Announcer: My Nose in front, followed by Sea Biscuit, followed by Some
  Crazy Lady followed by Middle-Aged Housewife followed by Wait, Who's
  That? followed by Silver Dasher. And now it appears there's a woman
  chasing the dogs.
  Lois: Let's go, kids!
  Stewie: Blackie, tell the boys in Kansas City the bet's off.
  Bettor: Too late, Stewie. The fix is in, and the noodles are boiling in
  the pot. Boiling, I tell you!
  Stewie: Aaargh!
  Peter: Wait a minute. I got it, I got it. I figured out my revelation:
  God loves a working man.
  Death: No!
  Peter: The Shadow is in reality Lamont Cranston, wealthy young man
  about town.
  Death: No! Oh, crap! I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble!
  Peter: Jeez, you're pretty shook up about that appointment of yours!
  You're Death. What are you afraid of?
  Mrs. Death: Where the hell have you been? When I said lunch, I said
  noon, not noon-ish.
  Death: Sorry, Ma.
  Mrs. Death: Sorry? Is "sorry" gonna reheat the casserole? So, who's
  your friend?
  Death: It's a work thing, Ma. Near-death experience.
  Mrs. Death: Where are you going?
  Death: I gotta take a leak.
  Mrs. Death: Well, don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't zip up
  your fly, a seagull will get you!
  Death: God, she's a pain in the ass! I wish Dad was still dead.
  Peter: I'll tell you, Lois' dad was a pain in the ass when I met him.
  [Doorbell rings]
  Peter: Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?
  Lois: Peter, you look so wonderful. Are you nervous about meeting Daddy?
  Peter: You'll know when I'm nervous.
  Carter: Lois?
  [Farts]
  Peter: Now. Lois, take the rap for this. I only get one chance to make
  a first impression.
  Lois: Hi, Daddy. That was me. And this is Peter.
  Peter: Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt. What are you feeding this gal? Peter
  Griffin. Can I take this freakin' tie off?
  Carter: It's a pleasure. My daughter is quite taken with you.
  Peter: And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at this. Show us front and
  back there, Lois. Don't think I don't know where that comes from.
  That's some world-class juice you got brewing in the old flesh balloon
  down there, Carter. Oh, yeah.
  Lois: I'm gonna go get my purse.
  Peter: All right. Hey, based on what you've seen with your wife what
  can we expect in terms of droopage here? We talking a slight slope or
  the full fried-eggs-hanging-on-a-nail thing?
"Carter: Peter, what do you think of this bronze statue?
Peter: It's nice.
Carter: It's early Etruscan.
Peter: Get out of here!
Carter: No, seriously.
Peter: That's great.
[Sputtering]
Captain: Hey, look. A manatee!
Chef: We can use it for soup.
Quagmire: Ensign Glen Quagmire. Welcome aboard. You picked a great day
  to get rescued. We were just about to sing a song about mopping.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Sailors: ? We're mopping the deck, which is Navy for 'floor' ? ? And
  when we're done mopping, we'll mop it some more ? ? 'Swab' means 'mop,'
  'deck' means 'floor'...?
  Mrs. Death: Could you tell me when you're leaving to go back in time. I
  was talking to a robe on the coat rack for 20 minutes before I realized
  you weren't in it.
  Death: Ma, for God's sake, leave me alone! I'm working!
  Mrs. Death Don't yell at your mother! If you yell at your mother, a hen
  will lay eggs in your tummy.
  Peter: Wow, brilliantly choreographed.
  Quagmire: Well, that's your tax dollars at work. Hey, why don't you
  join us and see the world?
  Peter: Sorry, pal. I've seen the world, and its name is Lois.
  Mrs. Death: How romantic! Why can't you find a nice girl?
  Death: Ma, she's gonna dump him.
  Mrs. Death: Well, at least he got that far. You know who he took to the
  prom? His cousin!
  Peter: That's weak.
  Mrs. Death: Yeah.
  Death: All right, all right, that's it! I'm sick of both of you. Come
  on, Peter.
  Mrs. Death: Death, put your jacket on, or you'll get frostbite!
  Death: I don't have skin!
  Mrs. Death: 'Cause you didn't eat your beans!
"Death: Come on. Get back in your big, fat body. Why should I help a
  guy save his marriage when I can't even get a girl?
  Peter: Whoa, wait! What are you saying?
  Death: The revelation, jackass! It could have helped you save your
  marriage. But too late. And by the way, when the lightning hit you, you
  soiled yourself. Enjoy.
  Peter: Wait. I can't lose Lois! Please, I'll do anything. What if I
  helped you get a girl?
  Death: Really? You think you could do that?
  Peter: Sure. All we gotta do is get you a little fixed up. Get you a
  haircut, give you a good clean...[Screams]...shave, maybe some cologne.
  The chicks'll be all over you.
  Death: Gee! You really think so?
  Peter: Absolutely. [Vomits]
  Death: You got any SPF-50? I bleach like a gym sock.
  Peter: Look, Death, will you relax? I told ya, the beach is a perfect
  place to pick up chicks. Now I want you to go over there, and ask those
  girls if you can play.
  Death: Hey, can I join you?
  Girl 1: I guess. What's your name?
  Death: Josh.
  Girl 1: Do you, like, live around here?
  Death: No. I live with my mom.
  Girl 1: Let's get out of here.
  Girl 2: See ya, Josh. Tell your mom we said hi.
  Man: Heads up!
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Meg: How do we get up there? Dad put grease on the pole.
  Chris: Don't worry, Meg. We've been studying fulcrums in school. You
  simply have to counter-balance the weight where the lever pivots. Like
  so.
  Meg: Stewie, honey, want to play rocket ship?
  Stewie: What the deuce?
  Lois: Blast off! Go on, Stewie. Get the note for Mommy.
  Stewie: How dare you use me for your own personal selfish...oh. Pull
  slower. I must remember to do this again when no one's around.
  Death: What the hell was I thinking? You don't know anything about
  picking up chicks.
  Peter: Are you kidding? I learned from the best.
  [Exciting instrumental music]
  Quagmire: Come on, buddy. We're dropping anchor in Jamaica!
  Peter: Great! We're getting closer to Rhode Island.
  Quagmire: Rhode Island? Forget that. I'm taking you out for some shore
  leave. Does this look like a "Q" to you?
  Peter: No.
  Quagmire: How about now?
  Peter: Sorry, Quagmire. Your crotch just looks like Lois to me.
  Quagmire: Well, let's ask her then. Hey, Lois, should Peter sit around
  and mope all night? Or should Peter go out with his buddy and have some
  fun? All right!
  [at the Tiki bar]
  Quagmire: Okay, that one's a feminist type. She's into he-men. And that
  one's mad for jazz. Watch this. "The plight of women in this hemisphere
  is deplorable!" "I can bench-press 800 pounds!" "You, me and Coltrane
  till dawn!" There you go, Peter. One for you, two for me.
  Peter: You guys go on without me. [Sighs]
  [Sad instrumental music]
  Death: Why didn't you go with them?
  Peter: You don't know what love's like.
  Death: Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy. She works at a pet store. I met her
  when her dad hung himself. But I was too shy to ask her out.
  Peter: What's with that moustache?
"Death: Let me see that. Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos. Here. This
  is her.
  Peter: Hey, nice ass.
  Death: Sorry. No. That's Edward James Olmos' ass. I guess I don't have
  a photo. But trust me, she's cute.
  Peter: Well, let's go get her.
  Death: I need that picture of Olmos' ass back
  Peter: Oh, yeah, right.
  Meg: Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell!
  Lois: I found the note! "Go back to the Mini-Mart"? Well, this isn't
  very creative. Let's go, kids.
  Chris: Mom, you remember that goldfish we flushed down the toilet? He
  wasn't dead.
  Death: There she is. That's her.
  Peter: All right, now go on, like we practiced.
  Amy: Hey, you.
  Death: Hi. I was just, [animals going crazy] in the neighborhood and so
  I thought that you.... This is a bad time. Maybe I'll just come back.
  Who'm I kidding? I'll never get her.
  Peter: Not with that attitude. Come on! Robert Reed got Florence
  Henderson, and he was one of thema toe-tapping Burgermeisters. You've
  gotta find a way to make it happen.
  Quagmire: So long, Peter. I hope you find your girl.
  Peter: Thanks, Quagmire. Hope you live next door to me someday.
  Quagmire: Hey, does this look like a "Q" to you?
  [Girl screams]
  Quagmire: How about now?
  Cleveland: So, where is it you need to go, my new honky friend?
  Peter: Rhode Island. That's not too far, is it?
  Cleveland: Nothing's too far away from Maxine, the cheatin' queen.
  Women. That's not fair. I'm just speaking out of hurt. That truck's
  coming up on us awful fast.
  [Truck honking]
  Peter: Holy crap! Do you see what I see?
  Cleveland: I'm afraid I do!
  Peter: We're being chased by ghosts!
  Death: So, you went through all this trouble to see your girl?
  Peter: I sure did. And I'm just a fat idiot. What's your excuse, you
  big chicken?
  Death: Chicken? You take that back!
  Peter: Yeah? Make me!
  Death: I don't make monkeys, I train 'em.
  Peter: Holy crap! I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
  Death: No. But this will!
  Peter: You bastard!
  Amy: What the hell is going on out here?
  Death: Actually, I, uh...
  Peter: He wanted to ask you something.
  Death: Amy, you want to go somewhere and grab a coffee?
  Amy: Sure. I get off at 2:00.
  Death: Great! Great. I'll meet you here.
  Peter: You did it! All right! Hey, who knows? You might even, you
  know...
  Death: I'm not following you.
  Peter: Intercourse.
  Death: Ah.
  Lois: What are you doing here?
  Cleveland: Loretta's mom wanted a snack so we had to pick her up some
  Kibbles 'n' Bits.
  Loretta: Cleveland!
  Cleveland: I mean Cheezits.
  Lois: Did Peter give you a clue for me?
  Loretta: Peter? He's down at Barrington with Brian and Quagmire.
  Lois: He's golfing on our anniversary?
  Cleveland: Oh, boy! You just put Peter in the doghouse. Which is where
  your mother...
  Loretta: Don't say it!
  Cleveland: Your mother smells.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Death: See, this is why I hate clothes shopping. I have no ass. I'm
  minus an ass.
  Peter: You're trying too hard, Death. She won't care what you're
  wearing. She's just gonna be glad to see you. That's how it was with
  Lois.
  [Growling]
  Peter: [Screams] Oh, God! Oh, God! [struggling] Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
  Carter: What the hell are you doing here?
  Peter: It's a long story with some terrific performances and a
  wonderful scene at a carnival, but I'll cut to the ending. I want to
  marry Lois!
  Carter: Out of the question! Now, listen, Griffin. I want you to take
  this, and stay away from my daughter forever!
  Peter: $1 million?
  Carter: $1 million.
  Peter: No deal! Lois may be worth a million to you, but to me, she's
  worthless. I love her, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
  Lois: Oh, Peter!
  Peter: Holy crap! Back then, I gave up $1 million just to be with Lois.
  Now I won't even miss a lousy golf game to spend our anniversary
  together. No wonder she's gonna dump me.
  Death: Or is she?
  Peter: Wait a minute. That's my revelation. I gotta pay more attention
  to my wife!
  Death: Eureka! Now, come on back to the golf course. I've got a date.
  Peter: Death, wait. Before we go, I need you to do me one more favor.
  Death: <spectral voice> Peter! Peter Frampton!
  Peter Frampton: Oh, no! God, please, no! I'm too young to die! Are you
  sure you're not supposed to be at Keith Richards' house?
  Death: All right. If you want to live, come with me <back to
  normal voice> and bring your guitar, and bring that thing that
  makes it go... [Makes wah-wah sound]
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Valet: Wait!
  Lois: Damn! How could he lie to me on our anniversary?
  [Frampton singing "Baby, I Love Your Way," and playing on acoustic
  guitar]
  Lois: Peter! Our song!
  Peter: Happy anniversary, Lois.
  Peter: This is the most romantic gift you've ever given me. How did you
  ever put all of this together?
  Death: Well, I had a little help from a very special friend.
  Amy: I like animals.
  Death: Uh-huh.
  Amy: Because they're like people. Just little furry people.
  Death: Yeah. Hey, you ever go on the Internet? They got some cool stuff
  there on that Internet.
  Amy: Oh, yeah, I bought these shoes from a company on the Internet
  because they don't test on animals.
  Death: [sighs]
  Amy: You know, animals never have war. War is an invention of mankind.
  Death: What the hell are you talking about? Animals fight all the time!
  Amy: Not with nuclear arms. You can't hug your children with nuclear
  arms.
  Death: Check, please.

Title: Lethal Weapons

Theme Song
  Joe: Baby! Twelve in a row!
  Peter: You must've had a great body before it went all funhouse mirror
  on you.
  Lois: I can't believe how terrific you look.
  Bonnie: Thanks. I've been taking tae-jitsu classes. You should come
  with me sometime.
  Lois: I'd love to.
  Bonnie: Oh, the baby's kicking. Want to feel?
  Peter: Sure. Ow! Oh, You are freakin' dead, kid!
  Lois: Peter!
  Meg: I love this time of year.
  Brian: Me, too. The summer tourists are gone, and we finally have the
  town to ourselves before those idiots from New York show up to watch
  the leaves change and take over the whole place.
  [Cars honking]
  Brian: Leafers!
  Peter: Holy crap! We gotta get outta here!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Bonnie: What about the boat?
  Joe: Leave it!
  Lois: Hurry, Peter! They're almost here!
  Chris: We're too late!
  Man: Yo, Matty. Check out those colors. Yellow like a taxi, orange like
  the ball at the Knicks game and red like the sauce on my Mamma Mia's cu
  cazz.
  Matty: Yeah, and brown like the guys I don't pick up in my cab.
  Man: Beautiful!
  ALL: Aaahhh!
  Diane Simmons: Good evening. Tonight's top story: Quahog is infested
  with loud, hairy creatures, also known as "New Yorkers."
  Tom Tucker: They migrate north every autumn to see the foliage. I think
  I speak for all of us when I say New York and everyone from there can
  fornicate themselves with an iron stick.
  [Horns honking]
  Lois: We're gonna be late for church.
  Peter: Move it! Damn leafers.
  Meg: Chris, quit it! Mom, Chris put his foot on my side again!
  Chris: I can't help it. I have these long dancer's legs.
  Meg: Move it!
  Stewie: Meg, stop whining! Chris, stay on your side! Lois, for God's
  sake, get off your ass and do some parenting!
  Lois: If you kids don't knock it off, we're not going to McDonald's
  after church.
  Both: Mom!
  Peter: Don't worry, we're going. But you don't get the supersize.
  Chris: Oh!
  Peter: Okay, you can supersize, but no apple pie.
  Meg: Come on!
  Peter: Okay, you get an apple pie, but you can't blow on it.
  Lois: Peter, don't contradict me in front of the kids!
  Peter: Siblings fighting is as natural as a white man's dialogue in a
  Spike Lee movie.
  Black Man: Wassup? Can I get two slices of pepperoni?
  White Man: [Incoherent growling]
  Lois: Who are all these people?
  Peter: Damn New Yorkers! They took all the good seats.
  Elderly Woman: Aren't you precious? [Screams]
  Stewie: Some of my novelty items were provided by Jack's Joke Shop of
  South Attleboro, Massachusetts. Remember, "If it ain't funny, it ain't
  worth jack."
  Priest: I'd like to welcome all our out-of-town parishioners. My
  cousin, Father Sapienza, is in from New York to see the leaves. And I'd
  like to invite him to do the opening prayer.
  Father Sapienza: Yo! God is good, eh? And he expects us to be good. And
  if you're not, he's gonna come down and bust your freaking skull. Amen.
  Man: Who do you think you're talking to? Your God ain't tougher than me!
  Man 2: You can't talk to the Father like that, you stupid cafone! I
  oughta come overthere and break your freakin' arm!
  Man: You wanna go, tough guy? I'll snap you in half like an almond
  biscotti from Valero's on 51st Street. Best in the city!
  Peter: Fellas, this is God's house, and the Patriots kick off in about
  45 minutes. Can we move this along?
  Man: Patriots suck!
  Peter: Blasphemy!
  Man: It burns!
  Scientist: Holy water? Where's that acid I ordered?
  Stewie: Hey, Guido, watch this. I've got to lay off the coffee!
  Ha-cha-cha! That's Jack's, Exit 14 off 295.
  Trainer: Tae-jitsu is about power for your body and your mind. Don't be
  afraid to free the beast inside you. Left kick, right kick, punch
  combo, stomp!
  Trainer: Beautiful. Again. Left kick.
  Trainer: You're doing great for your first lesson.
  Lois: I'm really cutting loose. Just like Julie Andrews in that movie
  where she showed her breasts.
  Boy: Oh, Mary. You'll never leave us, will you? Yes, those are lovely.
  But it doesn't quite answer our question.
  [Crowd cheering on TV]
  Man: Jets rule!
  Peter: Hey, watch where you're going, will you? Hey, Horace, put the
  Pats game on the TV, and get me a few beers, huh?
  Horace: Sorry, Peter. Someone stole the remotes...and the kegs. And I'm
  not sure, but I think I've been shot. Yep.
  Man: Hey, pal, watch my seat. I gotta bleed the lizard.
  Cleveland: Public urination is just wrong. Except during the Million
  Man March when protesters burned our Porta-Potties. Then I used my
  stream of justice to put out the hate.
  Quagmire: I don't know, fellas, I think there's potential in this
  crowd. Hey, honey, why don't you turn around and show me the Lower East
  Side?
  Transvestite: Sure.
  Quagmire: Whoa, transvestite! Back off! Wait a second. Pre-op or
  post-op?
  Transvestite: Pre-op.
  Quagmire: Whoa, transvestite! Back off! You're right. This place blows.
  We gotta send these straphangers back where they came from.
  Peter: Don't worry. I got an idea. An idea so smart my head would
  explode if I even began to know what I was talking about.
  [outside]
  Peter: [Angry growl] I am a man-eating tree. Go back to New York, or I
  will eat you! Just like I ate insane New York anchorman Dan Rather. And
  look who I had for dessert. Asexual former mayor Ed Koch. Leave my
  land, or I will smite you with my powerful limb.
  Man: What are you, nuts? Gimme that branch. Get off of me!
  Peter: Why you...
  Lois: Oh, my God! Stop fighting!
  Peter: Holy crap!
  Lois: Oh, my God!
  Chris: Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you
  below the belt because girls don't have anything down there. Can you
  teach me to kick ass?
  Lois: Oh, no. I do not condone violence. And I am not gonna be
  responsible for bringing fist fighting into our schools.
  Brian: Gee, Lois. Can you hear me all the way back there in the '50s?
  Stewie: Well, that was lame.
  Lois: Poor Peter. I emasculated him in front of all those people. I
  think he's really upset.
  Peter: Gather around, everybody. $10 is all it takes! Step right up and
  fight my wife! Come one, come all. She floats like a butterfly and
  stings like when I pee.
  Lois: Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction, at least not anymore.
  [dwarf Lois in cage at carnival, bouncing on trampoline]
  Lois: Me likey bouncy. Me likey bouncy.
  [back to present]
  Lois: I want you to get rid of all this right now because I am never
  fighting again. Ever!
  Peter: Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to Plan B.
  Chris: [growling] Oh, no! Ah! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Help me,
  for God's sake! He's gonna kill me! Help!
  Peter: Don't worry. It's a trained bear. He's in no real danger.
  Lois: He's teaching a class. I can't bother him now.
  Peter: Sure you can. Hey! Hey, Ralph Macchio! My wife here needs to
  talk to you. There you go, honey.
  Trainer: What is it, Lois?
  Lois: I-I don't think I should do tae-jitsu anymore. I'm afraid I'm
  gonna hurt someone.
  Trainer: But, Lois, you're my star pupil. I want you in my advanced
  class.
  Lois: Advanced class? No, no, no, no. I'm trying to quit.
  Trainer: Fine, quit. But get used to people walking all over you.
  Peter: Wait, hold on there. Nobody walks all over my wife, because I
  won't let them.
  Lois: Peter...
  Peter: Quiet, Lois. Men are talking. She learns things eventually, it
  just takes her longer. Come on, honey, we're outta here. If you hurry,
  I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
  Lois: I'll do it.
  [Inspiring instrumental music]
  Lucy: [Sobbing]
  Lois: Stewie, you want to swing?
  Stewie: Yes. Why not? I'll have a go at it. Perhaps a quick stretch
  first. Damn! Must've pulled something playing hoops last week.
  Stewie: I know you're not putting that rock up from here. You ain't got
  no J.
  Player: Yo, man! That's trippin'!
  Stewie: Brother, please! You're the one who's trippin'! Go on, cry home
  to your mama! She waitin' for ya.
  Player: Now don't make me put my size 13s up your narrow ass!
  Stewie: I don't sweat you! You bring it on, bitch! Now, how you gonna
  act? Bring that trash in here! This is my house!
  Lois: Excuse me. We were about to use that.
  Woman: You snooze, you lose, lady.
  Lois: You have two choices. Either my baby swings from this jungle gym,
  or you do.
  Stewie: Whoo, Lois! Someone's wearing their ovaries on the outside!
  Lois: She saw me walking to the swing!
  Stewie: Yes, she saw you. Easy now.
  Lois: Nobody walks all over me! Those days are over! Lois demands
  respect!
  Stewie: [Screams] I smell a messy diaper. God! Why does that turn me on?
  Chris: Hold it, Meg. Those two are mine.
  Meg: What?
  Chris: That's Randy and that's Fred. Randy is the messy one. Fred's
  very neat. When you get them together, hoo-hoo, hold onto your sides.
  Meg: Nice to meet you both.
  Chris: Murderer!
  Lois: Stop it, both of you! Starting now, you two are gonna love each
  other! Now stay that way.
  Chris: It's gonna be weird to potty.
  Peter: Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage those damn leafers dumped on
  our lawn. New York Post, New York Magazine, the New York Mets.
  Lois: Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine about the leafers!
  Take some action! Free the beast!
  Quagmire: That was strangely arousing. [shouts] [Grunts] Hello, 911?
  It's Quagmire. Yeah. Yeah. It's in a window this time.
  Brian: Wow, look at them run.
  Peter: Wait a second, Brian. That gives me an idea.
  Lois: The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go someplace fancy like The
  Olive Garden? Oh, the breadsticks. Me likey breadsticks! Me likey-
  <to self> You're a big girl now. Stop it!
  Peter: Hold on, Lois. Excuse me, New Yorker. I think you're in my seat,
  and I had sex with your mother last night.
  Lois: Peter, are you crazy?
  Man: What did you say?
  Peter: About the seat, or about my plowing your father's wife?
  Lois: What the hell are you doing?
  Peter: Excuse me. Is your refrigerator running? Because if it is, it
  probably runs like you. Very homosexually.
  Man: What?
  Lois: You wanna dance?
  Peter: Jets suck! Yankees suck! Knicks suck! Krypton sucks! That's
  right. Go back where you came from, you bastards.
  Trainer: We'll conclude today's graduation ceremony with a
  demonstration by the black belts. Okay, people, let's show them what
  we've learned. Kathy, get in there with Lois.
  Kathy: I can't. I have cramps.
  Lois: Why are you putting me up against the scrubs, Jared? Why don't
  you be a man and fight me yourself?
  Trainer: Lois, the sensei is a sacred position. I could never violate
  the spiritual bond of the student-master relationship.
  Lois: Oh. Then allow me.
  Trainer: The bond is broken!
  Lois: Then spin the wheel, Raggedy Man!
  Stewie: Go, Lois! Pummel him with your powerful fists of female fury!
  And then when he's weary, emasculate him with your incessant nagging!
  Women! Yakety, yak, yak, yak. You know. Enjoy the fight.
  [Martial arts fight music]
  Lois: [Cry of victory]
  Peter: Lois, that was amazing! Congratul-
  Lois: This is mine! This is where my babies come from!
  Announcer: And now back to the Movie of the Week: Speed 3 - Glacier of
  Doom.
  Man: If this glacier goes slower than one mile a year, we're all dead!
  Woman: Tell me something I don't know! Get out of the way!
  Peter: Lois, I was watching that. What you looking at?
  Lois: The underpants, lose 'em!
  Peter: Actually, I sort of have a headache, kinda. See, maybe tomorrow,
  or...
  Lois: Take 'em off!
  Peter: Yeah. Okay, honey.
  Stewie: Whoa! What the hell are you doing? Those are my graham crackers!
  Peter: Run along, Stewie. Daddy had a rough night.
  Stewie: Why you tottering, femme-sucked dewberry. I'm going to go find
  something to strike you with. Excuse me.
  Brian: Good morning. Peter, you look terrible. What happened?
  Peter: Last night, Lois was the man!
  Brian: Good Lord!
  Peter: I just want you to know, Brian-I didn't cry.
  Brian: It's okay.
  Lois: Oh, no! Peter! Stewie, what did you do?
  Brian: Looks like he freed the beast all over the back of Peter's head.
  Lois: Oh, my God. This is my fault. This is my fault. I brought
  violence into this house! I am the worst mother in the world!
  Stewie: Aha! I got it all on tape! Okay. This is me interviewing Ed
  Sullivan. What's new, Ed? [Imitating Ed Sullivan] "Well, Stewie,
  tonight we have a really big show." Okay. And now a word from our
  sponsors. "It takes a very steady hand. Don't touch the sides! Butter
  fingers." I was making radio shows for fun. Everybody does it.
  Everybody I know...shut up!
  Psychologist: Now, Stewart, I want you to take this Mommy doll and this
  Daddy doll and show me how they act together.
  Stewie: Yes. Very well. All right. "You see, Margaret, after 20-odd
  years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer phase me."
  "Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky
  deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?" What was that? What did you
  just write there?
  Psychologist: Give me that!
  Stewie: "Insecurity? Gender confusion?" I'll give you something to
  write about! Ooh, look at me! I'm insane! I'm Martin Lawrence on a
  bender!
  Psychologist: Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, does Stewart have a history of
  aggression?
  Lois: No, no. Hitting Peter is the first violent thing he's ever done.
  Stewie: Technically, the first act of violence was that time bomb I
  left ticking in your uterus before I came out. Happy 50th birthday,
  Lois.
  Psychologist: It's obvious that your son is learning this behavior from
  someone.
  Peter: I know who's responsible for Stewie's behavior. But if I told
  you who it was, Lois would beat the crap out of me.
  Lois: Now, just a minute! The whole reason I started fighting is
  because of you! I felt weak! You never listen to me! You undermine me
  in front of the kids! And besides, you're not exactly Father Of The
  Year yourself.
  Psychologist: Well, there seems to be a lot of anger in your household.
  You owe it to your son to learn how to manage these feelings.
  Stewie: Manage what?
  Lois: I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu. But from now
  on, we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, okay?
  Meg: Well, then tell Chris to quit drawing pictures of me with a pig's
  body.
  Chris: Don't censor me!
  Lois: No more anger! Okay. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise
  called "role reversal," where we pretend to be the person who makes us
  angry. I'll go first. "Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's
  worthless and dumb, and ignore her, and only listen to me-Peter."
  Peter: "I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales. But I don't let Peter buy
  anything he likes. Like that Narragansett beer stein where the hot
  chick has two mugs for jugs." It was eight freakin' dollars, and we
  have a dozen places to put it!
  Stewie: Oh, oh, me next, me next! "I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have
  a diverse stock portfolio. But I'm not above eating grass clippings and
  regurgitating them on the small braided rug near the door."
  Brian: "I'm a pompous little anti-Christ who will probably abandon my
  plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough
  trick named Jim."
  Brian: Whoa, whoa, Peter, calm down.
  Peter: I'm sick of Lois' anger-management techniques, Brian. They're
  not working.
  Brian: What about the writing-angry-letters- and-not-sending-them
  exercise?
  Peter: Aw, jeez, I wasn't supposed to send those?
  Meg: Look. I got a letter from Dad. "Dear Meg, for the first four years
  of your life, I thought you were a housecat." Dad!
  Stewie: "Dear Stewie, get out." Oh, that's nice.
  Lois: Mine just says, "Dear Lois." And after that, it looks like
  someone just spit on the paper! You got something to say to me?
  Peter: Yeah. PS... [Deep snort] Hold on a second.
  Brian: Hold on, hold on. Relax. Everybody, relax. All right, look, I
  was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under
  control before we kill each other. No, my psychiatrist gave me these
  pills. They're mood elevators. I think they could help...even us out.
  Lois: We're not taking pills. It's not natural.
  Peter: Neither is bleaching the hair on your upper lip, Martin Mull!
  Lois: Give us the pills!
  [African tribal music]
  ALL: Oom, bop bop.
  Lois: That was fun. What country should we do next?
  Chris: Monaco! Oh, wait. That's a principality.
  Brian: You guys want to hear something really funny? Those pills I gave
  you were placebos. Sugar pills!
  Peter: Wait a minute. Are you telling me I sang Ladysmith Black Mambazo
  for nothing?
  Lois: Did it kill you to be multi-cultural for a minute?
  Peter: I died a little inside, yes. You happy now?
  Lois: Don't you use that tone of voice, you...
  Peter: What were you going to say? "Fat ass"?
  Chris: "Wide load"?
  Meg: "Dough boy"?
  Stewie: "Country virtuoso Roy Clark"?
  Lois: How about "all of the above"?
  Peter: How is this for a name? "Miss, Pony Express is in." "What do you
  got for me, Joe?" "Let me see here. It's here somewhere. Here we are. A
  big bag of liver spots for Lois!"
  Peter: You just hit me.
  Lois: That's right! You can't hit me! I'm a girl!
  Peter: Sometimes I wonder. Kicking, Lois?
  Lois: Hurts, doesn't it?
  Peter: You tell me.
  Chris: Go, Dad! Kick her ass!
  Meg: Shut up! This is all Dad's fault!
  Chris: I don't like to be touched!
  (The Griffin's fight for a few minutes. More details in November 5,
  2005.)
  Brian: [Laughing] Man, I'm glad we got that out of our systems.
  Meg: I wonder what came over us?
  Chris: Maybe people are naturally violent.
  Lois: I don't believe that. I think it's all the TV we watch. There's
  so much violence.
  Peter: Yeah. TV is dangerous. Why doesn't the hell doesn't the
  government step in and tell us what we can and can't watch? And shame
  on the network that puts this junk on the air!
  Lois: Peter? Peter, maybe you shouldn't say anything bad about the
  network.
  Peter: Why? What are they gonna do? Cut our budget? I'm gonna go get a
  beer.
  [closing theme music]



Title: The Kiss Seen Around the World

Theme Song
  Lois: Oh, my! This place is enormous!
  Peter: Oh, man! They got these little plastic disc guns! I haven't seen
  one of these since Cleveland's wedding.
  Priest: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the
  joining of these two young people...
  Peter: [Peter laughing]
  Priest: ...in the bonds of holy matrimony...
  Peter: [Peter laughing]
  Priest: ...consecrated before God Almighty.
  Peter: [Peter laughing]
  Brian: Hey! Stratego! I used to love this game. Oh, my God! Abe Vigoda?
  Abe Vigoda: Go bother Steve Guttenberg. He's behind the Chinese
  checkers.
  Steve Guttenberg: Abe, shut up!
  [Cheerful music playing on keyboard]
  Peter: Hey, look at me, Chris! I'm Yanni, sans the attitude.
  Holden Caufield: My God, that's amazing! You are so talented.
  Peter: Huh?
  Holden Caufield: Wait a second! Something's not right here. You were
  just making it look like you were playing. You're a phony! Hey! This
  guy's a great big phony.
  Peter: Come on, Chris.
  [Concentration timer buzzing]
  Peter: There you are.
  Holden Caufield: You're a great big phony. You know that?
  Peter: Come on, Stewie. Your mom and I have something for you.
  Stewie: Let me guess. You picked out another colorful box with a crank
  that I'm expected to turn and turn until big shock, a jack pops out.
  You laugh, the kids laugh, the dog laughs and I die a little inside.
  Lois: Surprise, honey!
  Stewie: A trikie!
  Peter: I think he likes it!
  Chris: When I stick this army guy with the sharp bayonet up my nose it
  tickles my brain. Ow! Oh, now I don't know math.
  Stewie: Give it to me! Give it to me now, damn it!
  Lois: Not now, Stewie. When we get home.
  Holden Caufield: That's right! You're a big, fat phony!
  Neil: What I'm about to show you is a fight scene from Star Trek,
  Season 1, Episode 18. And as a bonus I'll identify when it's Shatner
  and when it's his stunt double, Fred Lubbins. That's Shatner, of
  course. That's Lubbins. Then that's Shatner. That's Lubbins. That's
  Shatner. That's Lubbins. Now, that's Shatner, but when I freeze-frame
  you can clearly see Lubbins' coffee cup on that rock.
  Meg: He is the biggest dork on the planet.
  Girl: Oh, totally.
  Neil: And so, because of his rough-and-tumble style of command, Captain
  Kirk is clearly superior to Jean-Luc Picard. Any questions? Meg?
  Meg: No! Leave me alone!
  Mr. McCloud: Thank you, Neil, for that totally irrelevant presentation.
  We all know Captain Picard is the superior officer.
  Girl: Hey, everybody! Mr. Lassenbee's getting arrested!
  Students: [Students chattering]
  Principal Shepherd: What in God's name? Mr. Lassenbee, what the hell's
  going on here?
  Mr. Lassenbee: Apparently, there's some law against teaching the
  evolutionary theory that Gil Gerard used a time machine, went back, and
  ejaculated into the primordial ooze.
  Principal Shepherd: This stupid country.
  Tom Tucker: Hello. Tom Tucker live at James Woods High School with this
  sensational breaking story. A teacher caught molesting children...with
  crackpot theories. Full story at 11:00.
  Camerman: And out.
  Meg: Oh, my God! That's Tom Tucker from the news!
  Tom Tucker: Hey, kids. Remember, Mr. T says, "I pity the fool who does
  drugs."
  [Sweeping instrumental music]
  Camerman: Better hurry up, Mr. Tucker.
  Tom Tucker: I'm coming.
  Diane Simmons: And reports indicate she has also consumed a record
  amount of seamen.
  Tom Tucker: Well, that sounds like one powerful hurricane, Diane. In
  other news, school-board elections took place last evening. And with
  six precincts reporting, candidate Fred Johnson leads candidate...
  ["Moving in Stereo" by The Cars playing]
  Tom Tucker: Hi, Meg. You know how cute I think you are.
  [song continues]
  Tom Tucker: Turmoil at the White House when President Bush stuck his
  finger in an electrical socket.
  Brian: Whoa! Yikes! Awkward.
  Tom Tucker: "Cheney told me that's where leprechauns hide their gold."
  More at 11.
  Holden Caufield: You know who lives in this house? A great big phony!
  That's right! A phony lives here! A big fat phony!
  Stewie: I say! Look at me! I feel like a regular grease monkey!
  Grease Monkey: Hey, remember that time I had that Mustang?
  Stewie: Oh, yeah! You took her for a spin that time.
  Grease Monkey: Yeah, that was awesome!
  Stewie: Then those chowderheads on the corner busted your stones.
  Grease Monkey: [Laughing]
  Stewie: Hey, your sister say anything about me?
  Meg: Oh, my God! I'm missing the news!
  Peter: We all miss The News, Meg. But Huey Lewis needs time to create,
  and we have to learn to be patient.
  Diane Simmons: And in entertainment, Mary Tyler Moore is 64 years old
  today.
  Tom Tucker: Really? 64?
  Diane Simmons: Yes.
  Tom Tucker: Now I thought she was dead.
  Diane Simmons: Nope. She's alive.
  Tom Tucker: Fantastic! And now this.
  [cut to pre-recorded shot back stage]
  Tom Tucker: Are you a high-school student interested in the glamorous
  world of unpaid internships? If so, we'd like to invite you to try out
  for Channel 5's Young Anchor Program.
  Meg: Oh, wow!
  Diane Simmons: You'll gain valuable experience, have a chance to work
  closely with Tom and me and best of all, produce your own on-air report.
  Tom Tucker: So, call us now.
  Both: Yeah!
  Announcer: Channel Five is not responsible for anyone burned, maimed,
  impaled, or molested during actual internship.
  Tom Tucker: All right, question number one. Would you consider growing
  a moustache?
  Boy: I guess so.
  Tom Tucker: Question number two. Look at my moustache. Do you think it
  tickles women when I kiss them?
  Boy: I don't know.
  Tom Tucker: Wrong. The answer is "only slightly." Only slightly. Next!
  Diane Simmons: [Thinking] Oh, God! I can't hire any of these girls.
  They're all too pretty. Their breasts are too perky. Perfect! [aloud]
  Congratulations! You got the job.
  Meg: Oh, my God! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! This is beyond
  anything I've ever dreamed of.
  Diane Simmons: You and your partner will start first thing tomorrow
  after school.
  Meg: Great! Who's my partner?
  Neil: Hey there, hot stuff!
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Neil: Well, well. It appears the fates have conspired in our favor, eh,
  Meg?
  Meg: Look! Stay away from me, Neil! Just because we work together
  doesn't mean I have to like you. Give it to me!
  Neil: What's that?
  Meg: Give it to me, Neil!
  Meg on tape: Give it to me! Give it to me, Neil!
  Neil: Yeah. That'll work just fine.
  Tom Tucker: Hey, look who's here, Diane. It's our bright-eyed young
  interns. Did you two remember to wear your eager caps?
  Meg: I sure did, Mr. Tucker!
  Diane Simmons: Great! 'Cause you two are gonna have so much fun!
  Tom Tucker: Don't act any cheerier, Diane. You'll give us all diabetes.
  Diane Simmons: Bite me, Tom.
  Tom Tucker: Come on, kids! And here's where we produce our in-studio
  celebrity interviews. I just did one with Dustin Hoffman. He's
  impossible to book, but we got him.
  [cut to tape of interview]
  Tom Tucker: So, Dustin, it's been a while. I got to say, you look great.
  Dustin Hoffman: [seduction scene from "The Graduate"] Are you trying to
  seduce me...
  Voice: ...Mr. Tucker?
  Tom Tucker: I am not trying to seduce you, Dustin Hoffman. You really
  look great.
  Dustin Hoffman: [scene from "Rain Man"] Uh-oh! Twelve minutes to Wapner.
  Tom Tucker: Yes, I understand your hectic schedule. Well, Dustin, we
  really appreciate you taking the time to be with us here in the studio.
  If there's anything I can do for you...
  Dustin Hoffman: [scene from "Hook"] Bring me Peter Pan!
  Tom Tucker: I'll keep my eye out for him. Thanks, Dustin.
  [back in studio]
  Tom Tucker: He's this tall.
  Lois: Can you believe it? Our little Stewie learning to ride his first
  tricycle.
  Peter: Yeah, this is gonna be even more exciting than when Brian taught
  me about Christopher Columbus.
  [back in time; Peter and Brian drawn a la Mr. Peabody and Sherman]
  Peter: Where we going, Brian?
  Brian: Well, Peter, we're going to visit the year 1492. That's when
  Columbus set sail on his famous voyage to the New World.
  Peter: Hey, we're on a ship!
  Brian: That's right, Peter. This is the Santa Maria, one of three ships
  Columbus took to find a direct route to India.
  Columbus: Any sign of India yet, fellows?
  Sailor: Nothin' yet, Captain.
  Peter: India? But I thought Columbus was going to America.
  Brian: On the contrary, Peter. Columbus discovered America entirely by
  mistake.
  Peter: Wow!
  Stewie: What the deuce do you think you're doing? Back off, fat man!
  Peter: Hang on, Stewie!
  Stewie: What the... Hey, let go! Get your filthy paws off! Let go! Let
  go, I say! Let-don't let go! Oh, this is exhilarating!
  Lois: Go, Stewie!
  Peter: Yea, Stewie!
  Lois: Here, I gotta check on dinner. You keep taping Stewie. Don't miss
  a moment.
  Peter: I got it. Look! It's dancing with me! It's like there's this
  incredibly benevolent force that wants me to know there's no reason to
  be afraid. Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, it makes my
  heart burst.
  God: It's just some trash blowing in the wind! Do you have any idea how
  complicated your circulatory system is?
  Meg: Hi, Mr. Tucker. I brought you some Rice Krispie treats 'cause I
  remember you saying you liked them on the news. See, look. This one is
  in the shape of a heart.
  Tom Tucker: I'm sorry, but there's a handsome man in my spoon. You'll
  have to come back later.
  Meg: [Meg sighing]
  Neil: Oh, my God! Meg's in love with Tom Tucker! Try to move in on my
  woman, will you, Tom Tucker? Well, no one crosses Neil Goldman and gets
  away with it! I added a little something to your coffee that I don't
  think you're gonna like. Here's your coffee, Mr. Tucker.
  Tom Tucker: What the hell is in this?
  Neil: Sweet'N Low! That's for trying to steal my woman!
  Tom Tucker: Go back and bring it to me with urine in it like I asked!
  Neil: Yes, sir.
  Bully: Nice bike.
  Stewie: Oh, if that's not the understatement of the century.
  Bully: It's cool. Too cool for you!
  Stewie: No, no. I think it's right where I'm at.
  Bully: Out of my way!
  Stewie: I see. I suppose you do have to ride it to truly appreciate its
  virtues. Well then, I'll just wait here till you get back. Where the
  devil is he?
  Brian: You've obviously never met a bully.
  Stewie: What do you mean, "bully"?
  Brian: He wasn't taking it for a test ride. He was just taking it.
  Stewie: You mean.... He stole my trikie! [Crying]
  Meg: You know, Mr. Tucker, has anyone ever told you your eyes are...
  Tom Tucker: Hang on, sweetie. I've got to call Peter Jennings and
  reschedule our golf game.
  [Phone ringing] [Rock 'n' roll music playing on answering machine]
  Peter Jennings: This is Peter. You know what to do.
  Producer: Mr. Tucker? Miss Simmons? There's some nut on top of Town
  Hall with a high-powered rifle! The gunman has been identified as the
  notorious Mass-media Murderer who targets members of the press.
  Tom Tucker: Whoa! "Mass-media Murderer"? You know, I think this would
  be a fine opportunity to give our interns real-world experience.
  Diane Simmons: Hey! That means you'll get to ride in the Action 5 News
  chopper! I'm so jealous! Better put in for new interns. Good luck!
  Gunman: I've got Hugh Downs up here! And I'm gonna splatter his
  distinguished career all over the pavement!
  Hugh Downs: Why me? Why the media?
  Gunman: I've got my reasons! Dan Rather thinks he can just condense a
  day's worth of events into a half hour.
  Hugh Downs: Don't get me started on Rather. That arrogant jerk.
  Gunman: Really? You know him?
  Hugh Downs: Well, I'm Hugh Downs. I know everybody. In fact, he's right
  down there.
  Gunman: Where?
  Hugh Downs: Ha-ha! See you later, sucker! And, by the way, Rather is an
  okay guy in small doses.
  Neil: Look how close we're getting, Meg!
  Gunman: Hey! That was my lucky assassin hat!
  [Gun firing]
  Pilot: Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!
  Meg: Oh, my God, we're gonna die! There's so much of life I haven't
  experienced! I never even got the chance to be some drunk college guy's
  last resort!
  Neil: My years of expensive orthodontic work will be a total waste!
  Meg: I never even had my first kiss!
  Neil: It's not too late, Meg.
  [Romantic instrumental music]
  Neil: I'm here for you.
  [Gun firing]
  Gunman: Time to sign off.
  Hugh Downs: Remember me, dirt bag?
  [Heroic instrumental music]
  Man: Wow! You saved those kids' lives, Mr. Downs!
  Hugh Downs: All in a day's work. Remember, if you ever need me, just
  blow this whistle or call John Stossel's cell phone. Hugh Downs away!
  Lois: Honey, thank God you're safe! We were so worried.
  Diane Simmons: We now go to Junior Anchor Neil Goldman with exclusive
  Channel 5 footage from today's exciting scene.
  Neil: Thank you, Diane. There may have been some sort of commotion on
  the rooftop, but the real story was inside the mouths of Meg Griffin
  and Neil Goldman where a meeting of the tongues-a summit of
  saliva-established a new world order of love.
  Meg: [Screams]
  Neil: Let's watch it one more time in super slow-mo! This is where we
  cease to be Meg and Neil, and begin life anew as "Meil."
  Meg: Oh, my God! He put it on TV?
  Lois: Isn't that cute, Peter? Our daughter's first love.
  Meg: I just want to kill myself! I'm going upstairs right now and eat a
  whole bowl of peanuts! I'm allergic to peanuts! You don't know anything
  about me!
  Peter: Who was that guy?
  Stewie: I say, constable, I'd like to report the theft of my tricycle.
  Cop: Oh, look at the little baby. Aren't you cute? Where's your mommy?
  Stewie: How dare you condescend to me! I demand justice!
  Man: I'm here to turn myself in. I have a dismembered Baltic hooker
  bleeding through the tarp in my trunk.
  Cop: Oh, look at the little baby. Aren't you cute? Where's your mommy?
  Kids: [Laughing]
  Meg: Where did you get that shirt?
  Girl: Neil's giving them out.
  Neil: Hello, lover.
  Meg: Neil! What are you doing? I'm not your lover! I don't even like
  you!
  Neil: Meg, I strongly suggest you hold my hand, lest you look like a
  slut.
  Meg: Listen, you freak! Tell these people that there's nothing going on
  between us!
  Neil: Oh, don't be afraid of the fire, Meg. I won't let you burn. Al?
  Why haven't I leaped?
  Al: Ziggy says you can't "leap" until she loves you back.
  Neil: Don't worry. I'll get her.
  Personal trainer: So what were you wanting to work on? Cardio, upper
  body, what?
  Stewie: Upper body, definitely. I need to get buff to get my tricycle
  back.
  Personal trainer: Luckily we're running a special right now for the
  next 17 minutes.
  Stewie: That's a little unusual, but okay, tell me.
  Personal trainer: The normal plan is 78 months at $40 a month, and $200
  down. Watch this. Forget the down. Watching? Good-bye $40 a month.
  Let's do $35.
  Stewie: Okay, $35. Now, that's the cheapest?
  Personal trainer: Hang on. Trace, can you bring me some of those free
  gym bags? Thanks.
  Stewie: I can probably just do some pushups at home...
  Personal trainer: Okay, well, let's start with the complete body-fat
  test, maybe a heart rate...
  Stewie: You're actually not hearing me. I don't think this is for me.
  Thanks anyway. And for the future? You came on a little strong.
  Meg: What's going on here?
  Lois: Oh, we invited Neil's family over for dinner.
  Mort: Hi!
  Muriel: Hello!
  Meg: You what?
  Peter: Yeah, we wanted to get to know 'em better. You know, seeing as
  how the two of you will one day bless our home with the pitter-patter
  of sweet little grandchildren as ugly as sin.
  Neil: You never told me your mother was such a stone-cold fox! Now I
  see where you get it.
  Lois: Meg, he's so charming.
  Chris: My name is Chris. I'm supposed to be on my best behavior
  tonight, and not mention poo. Oh, God! What have I done?
  Peter: Well, let's eat.
  Mort: I think it's very, very nice that our children had this wonderful
  kiss. I remember when Muriel and I had our first kiss. And it was just
  awful. Oh, just awful. We were both very sick, weren't we, dear?
  Muriel: We were terribly sick. We were both 14, and it was winter, and
  we had terrible head colds.
  Mort: Yes. Mine especially was very bad. I had terrible mucus coming
  out from inside my nose. And the other children, they were very nasty
  to me about that. They said bad, hurtful things to me. They called me
  "Tasty Cakes" and they would beat me and stick pine cones in my ass.
  Those were very bad times.
  Lois: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
  Mort: Thank you very much.
  Meg: Excuse me. I'm gonna go throw up.
  Mort: Please flush the toilet twice. Once for the bulk, and again for
  the remainder. Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.
  Bully: Hey, you're blocking my light, you stupid baby!
  Stewie: You know, my hooligan friend, I've been racking my brain in a
  thus far fruitless attempt to resolve our recent unpleasantness. Then
  it dawned on me. Your cruelty merely stems from some deep-seated inner
  pain. So, the obvious remedy is a healthy dose of outer pain!
  Tom Tucker: School children washing cars to raise money for charity. Is
  there anything more arousing? Finally, we go to Meg Griffin for a
  special Channel 5 Junior Anchor Segment on the moon. Meg?
  Meg: The moon. There's a reason no one goes there. It's cold. And it's
  ugly. And its surface is plagued with deep craters and jagged peaks.
  Oh, wait! That's not the moon. It's Neil Goldman's face. Recently, many
  of you saw me kissing this freak of nature. But, if I didn't think I
  was seconds away from death, I would have never done it. I mean, who in
  their right mind would? Well, I went to the streets to find out. Would
  you kiss this guy?
  Girl: Ugh, no.
  Girl 2: No way!
  Girl 3: No.
  Girl 4: No!
  Girl 5: No.
  Girl 6: No.
  Mort: God, no! What's the matter with you? Ugh!
  Meg: It's official. Neil Goldman is unkissable. Hear that, Neil? I
  don't like you, and I never will! Back to you, Tom.
  Tom Tucker: Thank you, Meg. I guess beggars can be choosers. And now
  this.
  Stewie: Well, well. Isn't this a darling picture?
  Bully: Let me go, man!
  Stewie: Tell me, how old are you, Charlie?
  Bully: 7.
  Stewie: 7? My, my, you're practically a lady. Ironic that your fate is
  in the hands of an infant. Now tell me where my tricycle is!
  Bully: I don't know. I lost it.
  Stewie: Very well. I have other ways of obtaining the truth.
  [Metallic grinding]
  Bully: No! Don't!
  Lois: Stewie? Look what I found.
  Stewie: My trikie!
  Lois: What's going on down here?
  Stewie: We're playing house.
  Lois: That boy is all tied up.
  Stewie: Roman Polanski's house.
  Tom Tucker: <practicing line reads> "Good evening. I'm
  Tom Tucker. Our top story, the President has been shot." "Tragedy
  strikes the nation. The President has been shot." "What's the President
  doing in this casket? We'll tell you right after this." Hey, Meg, nice
  job on that report last night.
  Meg: Wow! Thanks, Mr. Tucker. That means so much coming from someone as
  handsome as yourself.
  Tom Tucker: Say, how'd you like to pick up a handsome man's dry
  cleaning?
  Meg: Well, sure. But isn't that Neil's job?
  Tom Tucker: Little jerk hasn't been in all day.
  Meg: He hasn't?
  Producer: We got a breaking story! There's some geek on top of Town
  Hall and he's about to jump!
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Meg: Oh, my God! Neil!
  Tom Tucker: Is it Neil? Huh. I've been calling him Ned all week.
  Meg: Oh, my God! Neil, please don't jump.
  Neil: I was just a piece of eye candy that she turned into an all-day
  sucker.
  Meg: Mr. Tucker! Thank God you're here! Someone's gotta do something!
  He'll fall!
  Tom Tucker: I'm on it, Meg. Hey, have that cartoon sound-effect guy cue
  up the [whistling], then top it off with a [splat]. And if there's time
  before commercial, be ready with a [sentimental music].
  Meg: Oh, my God! You don't care about him at all, do you? All you care
  about are your stupid ratings! You're a horrible man! Neil, I'm sorry!
  Neil: Meg?
  Horace: There he goes!
  Tom Tucker: Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff!
  Meg: Neil!
  Neil: Meg, you do care!
  Meg: Don't read too much into this, Neil.
  Neil: Well, it's hard not to when I'm lying right on top of you.
  Meg: Look-just because you're repulsive and the most annoying person on
  the planet-and I'm not the only one who thinks so-that doesn't mean I
  want you to kill yourself.
  Neil: Thanks, Meg. But I was never really planning to jump.
  Holden Caufield: Wasn't gonna jump? You're a phony! Hey, everybody!
  This guy's a great big phony!

Title: Mr. Saturday Knight

Theme Song
  Mort: On the whole, I enjoy my job as a pharmacist. In fact, many of my
  customers are your mommies and daddies. Jimmy Hopkins, your mother had
  awful postpartum depression after you were born. And Danielle, your
  father had bad, very bad hemorrhoids that stung him unmerciful. Oh,
  they were awful. They were like stinky little balloons. And I gave him
  some special ointment and he hurt so bad that he had to apply it in the
  car with his sock. Thank you.
  Boy: Cool! I want to be a pharmacist!
  Boy 2: Oh, yeah!
  Teacher: Thank you, Mr. Goldman. And our final speaker is Mr. Peter
  Griffin.
  Chris: [Cheering]
  Peter: Hey, kids! Hey, you know what I do? I work at a toy factory and
  you know what I do there?
  Boy: I bet you're just one of those low-level assembly-line guys who
  stands there all day screwing heads on dolls. "Ooh, is it on straight?
  I don't know." Boo!
  Peter: Why, you little snot-nosed...
  Teacher: Mr. Griffin! [Whispering] He plays kickball in the park after
  school. Get him there. [aloud] Does anyone have any questions for Mr.
  Griffin?
  Boy: Yeah. Can we listen to the claims adjuster again?
  Class: [Cheering]
  Tom Tucker: Welcome back to Quahog 5 News. And now, here's Ollie
  Williams with the "Blaccuweather" Forecast. Ollie?
  Ollie Williams: It gonna rain!
  Tom Tucker: Thanks. And finally, we go live to Asian reporter Trisha
  Takanawa interviewing a guy from the upcoming Renaissance Faire.
  Tricia Takanawa: Thanks, Tom. Sir, for those who aren't familiar with
  the tradition, can you tell us about the Renaissance Faire?
  Man:: Yea. But first, bride of Genghis, thou must explainest to me thy
  very peculiar electronic wand. Oooh!
  Stewie: All right, Rupert, are you ready to hear our Mad Lib? [Clears
  throat] "Cinderella had three wicked step-watermelons, who were very
  smelly to her. So, her fairy god toilet turned her pumpkin into a fanny
  and sent her off to the poop." [laughing] Oh, my! How ruthlessly absurd!
  Lois: Peter, how was your big presentation at Chris' class?
  Peter: It was a huge waste of time.
  Lois: Well, it couldn't have been that bad.
  Peter: It was terrible. Everyone else there had some big important job
  and was way more successful than me.
  Brian: Hey, come on, you have a great job.
  Stewie: Yeah...[Stuttering]...you're doing good.
  Lois: Peter, if you're not satisfied, then be more assertive. Invite
  Mr. Weed over for dinner and show him what you have to offer the
  company.
  Peter: Yeah, I guess I could. I just hope it goes okay. We've had bad
  luck with dinner guests. Remember when Margot Kidder was here?
  Lois: We loved you in the Superman movies. You were just wonderful.
  Margot Kidder: [Screaming]
  Peter: Mr. Weed, I was wondering if maybe you'd like to come over to my
  house for dinner Friday night. That wasn't so hard.
  Mr. Weed: Well, what time?
  Peter: Uh, I don't know. 7:30, 8:00?
  Mr. Weed: Fabulous! What shall I bring?
  Lois: Peter, calm down. Everything's gonna be fine.
  Peter: I hope so. If I blow this, I'll have to go back to my old job at
  the Electric Company.
  Man: D.
  Peter: Ot.
  BOTH: Dot.
  Man: B.
  Peter: Et.
  Man: Bet.
  Peter: Bet. I knew that. Slow it down.
  Man: P.
  Peter: It.
  Man: Pit.
  Peter: Come on, pal. It's my first day.
  Man: F.
  Peter: At.
  Man: Fat.
  Peter: Oh, that's it, buddy! [Fighting]
  [Doorbell rings]
  Lois: That must be him.
  Peter: Oh God! I hope that thing doesn't happen where I get nervous and
  I can't control of the volume of my voice.
  Mr. Weed: Hello, Peter. How are you?
  Peter: [Yelling] Fine! [Quietly] Please come in.
  Lois: It's so nice to have you over, Mr. Weed.
  Mr. Weed: Thank you, Mrs. Griffin. I understand that you have a
  beautiful family.
  Lois: Yes, we do, but the children won't be joining us for dinner. It's
  almost their bedtime.
  Peter: [Blows whistle] State your names.
  Meg: Meg!
  Chris: Chris!
  Stewie: And I'm Liesl.
  Peter: Mr. Weed, the Griffin children would like to say goodnight to
  you.
  [music to "So Long, Farewell" from "The Sound of Music"]
  Chris, Meg & Stewie: ? So long, farewell, au revoir, auf
  wiedersehen ?
  Meg: ? I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne ? Yes?
  Peter: No!
  Chris & Stewie: ? So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye ?
  Chris: ? I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye -- Goodbye! ?
  Stewie: ? The sun has gone to bed and so must I ?
  Chris, Meg & Stewie: ? So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen,
  goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye ?
  Peter, Lois & Mr. Weed: ? Goodbye ?
  Mr. Weed: Mmm! Who would think a woman with such beauty would have the
  culinary skills of Emeril Lagasse?
  Lois: Oh, well thank you. Bam! [Laughing] Peter, don't you have
  something to say to Mr. Weed?
  Peter: Oh, yeah. Mr. Weed, I don't care what the guys at work say. I
  never thought you were an effeminate weirdo.
  Brian: So, what kind of a name is "Weed"?
  Mr. Weed: They gave it to my grandfather on Ellis Island. Our real name
  was "Bermudagrass." Peter, being here with your wonderful family, your
  beautiful home and your funny talking dog, well, I'm impressed. In
  fact, starting Monday, I would like to promote you to Head of Toy
  Development.
  Peter: Holy crap! Ah, thanks, Mr. Weed! You won't be sorry. Brian, quit
  it. You're embarrassing me here.
  Lois: Peter, Brian's choking! Do the Heimlich maneuver quick!
  Mr. Weed: [Choking]
  Brian: He's dead.
  Margot Kidder: [Screaming] I forgot my purse.
  Peter: All right, let's not panic. Nobody even knows about this yet.
  Death: Police! Random dead-body search!
  Peter: Oh, my God, Lois! Stall them!
  Lois: Peter, what are you doing?
  Peter: Just stall them, Lois!
  Death: [Laughing] Got ya! It's just me, Death. I'm here for the body.
  Lois: Peter, it's okay. It's just Death.
  Peter: Thank God!
  Death's Dog: Hey, did someone choke on a roll in here?
  Brian: Oh, no, no, no. I spit it up.
  Tom Tucker: Recapping our top story. Doreen, I lost your phone number.
  We met at the Sky Lounge last night. Please call me. In other news, toy
  industrialist Jonathan Weed was found dead in the home of an employee
  who claims Weed choked on a dinner roll. No charges will be filed
  against the employee but the dinner roll has been taken into custody.
  [Somber instrumental music]
  Stewie: I'd do her. Do her. Wouldn't do her. Who hasn't done her? Do
  her. Lose the pigtails and we'll talk. Do her, do her.
  Priest: And now, the last man to see Jonathan Weed alive has offered to
  say a few words.
  Peter: Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, we of the Christian faith
  believe that Jesus is not really dead but that he must let the world
  think that he is dead until he can find a way to control the raging
  spirit that dwells within him. [Peter humming ominous music] Anyway,
  right before he died, Mr. Weed promoted me to Head of Toy Development,
  and I've brought along my attorney who confirms that this constitutes a
  verbal contract. Isn't that right, Saul? [Peter's hand talking] "Yes,
  sir. Verbal contract." Thank you.
  Leonard Hale: Glad to see you all found your way over from the
  cemetery. I'm Leonard Hale, Mr. Weed's lawyer. We found this tape among
  Mr. Weed's personal effects, with instructions that it be screened
  immediately after his funeral. Enjoy.
  Cameraman: Good morning. Camera time.
  Mr. Weed: Turn it off. I don't have my face on yet. I'm ugly.
  Cameraman: You want to tell us a little something about what you're
  making there.
  Mr. Weed: I will tell you. Just a couple of eggs with the peppers left
  over from last night. [Snickering] Okay, playtime is over. Turn it off,
  monkey. Okay?
  Leonard Hale: [Clearing throat] [Fast-forwarding tape]
  Mr. Weed: Hello, friends. If you're watching this, I am dead and I bet
  you're pretty bummed. But I have good news. The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy
  Factory shall be torn down to make way for the Happy-Go-Lucky Terminal
  Disease Institute.
  Peter: What?
  Mr. Weed: The demolition will begin in...now.
  [Screaming]
  Counselor: Okay, we've got your typing test here and all the pertinent
  data about your...[stuttering]...background and, um, skills, and....
  Peter: And?
  Counselor: You, know, I got to be honest with you. I only have another
  week and a half here and I have completely checked out.
  Peter: Oh.
  Counselor: Yeah.
  Peter: Well, what should I do?
  Counselor: [Sighs pensively] Chef?
  Peter: Oh, sorry, we're out of towels. Let me get that for you, sir.
  [Blowing]
  Man: What? I'm supposed to pay $2 for stickers 'cause this guy can't
  hear? Come on!
  Peter: Hey, I might be deaf but I have feelings! Oh. I mean...what?
  Meg: Has Dad found a permanent job yet?
  Lois: Meg, your father's going through a bit of a career transition.
  He's just sampling a few things, searching for something that fits him
  just right. [Gasping]
  Brian: Clearly it's not that tube top.
  Peter: Hey! Looking for a good time, sweet cheeks?
  Meg: Oh, my God!
  Lois: Peter, get in the car!
  Peter: Okay, but it will cost you. What do you want? A Cleveland
  Steamer?
  Lois: I said get in the car! What's a Cleveland Steamer?
  Brian: It means that he'll...
  Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Be cool, be cool. Yes, you go to Maple Street,
  and then take a left, and then you go.... Okay, so you want to party or
  what?
  Lois: Get in this car right now!
  Stewie: It's eerie, isn't it? Like looking into the future.
  Gene Rayburn: Forgetful Freddy was so forgetful...
  All: How forgetful was he?
  Gene Rayburn: He was so forgetful, whenever he tried to remember
  someone's name he drew a "blank."
  Lois: Oh, God! This is all my fault. If I hadn't pushed you so hard to
  invite Mr. Weed to dinner he'd still be alive and you'd still have your
  job.
  Peter: Don't worry, Lois. We'll get through this. We just have to
  scrimp a little, that's all. You know, sell some stuff we don't really
  need. This'll bring in a couple of bucks.
  Lois: Peter, please, listen to me. When we got married, you always
  talked about your one dream job. Remember? And you put that dream aside
  in order to provide for this family.
  Peter: Yeah?
  Lois: Well, I've saved some money from teaching piano, and I say this
  is the perfect time for you to pursue that dream.
  Peter: Really?
  Lois: Yes!
  Peter: You know, since money's getting tight, I was gonna suggest that
  we eat the kids. You know, jokingly at first, but then I was gonna
  gauge your reaction and if you were cool with it, we would go from
  there, but this is a much better idea. I'm going to do it, Lois. I'm
  going to realize my dream! I am going to be a Renaissance Faire jouster!
  Lois: Oh, Peter!
  Margot Kidder: [Screaming]
  Lois: Oh, this is so exciting! My little jouster's first day. Here's
  your lunch.
  Peter: Thanks, honey. Oh, egg salad?
  Lois: Have a good time.
  Peter: I'll try. Hey, Mort.
  Mort: Oh, God! Don't hurt me! Oh, hi, Peter.
  Peter: Hey, you gonna be a jouster, too?
  Mort: Yes. I'm trying to overcome my fear of swords 'cause a man in a
  pirate suit stabbed me in the ear when I was 5, and then again when I
  was 30. What about you? Same?
  Peter: Not really. It kinda all goes back to when I was 18. I was going
  through that rebellious phase, and hanging out with a bad crowd.
  Girl: Here, Peter. Try one of these.
  Peter: What is it?
  Girl: It's a cheeseburger.
  Kids: [Laughing]
  Peter: Of course, now I know it wasn't a cheeseburger but at that time,
  I was ready to believe anything. I didn't know what the hell was going
  on. I wandered around for hours and somehow ended up at the Renaissance
  Faire. [in flashback] I can fly!
  Black Knight: Oh, my God!
  Peter: [Screaming] I was saved by the one and only Black Knight of the
  Quahog Renaissance Faire.
  Black Knight: A word of advice-the path to knighthood is paved with
  strength and nobility, not LSD and sideburns.
  Peter: And from that moment on, I knew someday I wanted to be a knight
  like him.
  Mort: Oh, mercy! I was once addicted to antihistamines. I took so many
  I thought I was Mr. Peanut.
  Peter: Ah, that's a great story, too.
  Coach: You all think you got what it takes to be jousters! If you're
  gonna joust, you got to want it! Let me hear your war cry!
  Mort: [Feeble cry]
  Coach: Is that the best you got, you pile of crap?
  Mort: Yes. From an early age, my parents discouraged loud noises!
  Coach: You know what you are? You're a candy-ass maggot! You find
  something funny, maggot?
  Man: Sir, no, sir!
  Coach: You love the Middle Ages, don't you?
  Man: Sir, yes, sir!
  Coach: The concept of a geocentric universe gets you sexually excited,
  doesn't it?
  Man: Sir, yes, sir!
  Coach: You want to make 16th century mathematician Johannes Kepler your
  bitch, don't you?
  Man: Sir, yes, sir!
  Black Knight: Welcome, apprentices.
  Peter: It's him.
  Coach: Look alive, ladies. Allow me to introduce the best of the best
  the Black Knight himself! And this is his trophy wench, Maid Madeleine!
  [Dinging in each suit of armor]
  Mort: Ding.
  Peter: Excuse me, Mr. Black Knight?
  Black Knight: I'm busy.
  Peter: Oh, well, I just wanted to thank you. I don't know if you
  remember, but when I was a kid you helped me get my life back on the
  right path.
  Black Knight: Damn it. Look, I'm busy, all right?
  Peter: Okay. I'll come back later.
  Black Knight: Damn rookies.
  Mort: Are all the other men out of the shower yet?
  Stewie: [to Meg] Hey, you, porker. Yes, I'm calling you a porker and
  there's nothing you can do about it because I'm protected by my
  impenetrable cereal-box fort. [Laughing] [to Brian] Hey, you, drunkie.
  Yes, that's right, I'm calling you drunkie and there's nothing you can
  do about it because I'm...
  [Brian slams cereal box fort, shocking Stewie]
  Lois: The toast is ready.
  Peter: I'll get it, Lois. There you go.
  Lois: Peter, maybe you shouldn't bring your lance to the table.
  Peter: Lois, if I'm gonna get good enough to impress the Black Knight,
  my lance must be with me at all times. You guys are gonna be so proud
  when you see me out on that field. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go
  practice.
  Meg: [Screams] Oh, my God, Dad! My earring! Dad, stop!
  Peter: Yeah, two mutton joints, please.
  Man: Thou wishes to feast on the appendage of a humble ovine.
  Peter: Listen, you freak. We don't all watch Frasier, okay? Now, give
  me two mutton joints.
  Mort: Thank you.
  [Romantic instrumental music]
  Madeleine: 'Tis a glorious afternoon. Wouldst thou not agree?
  Peter: Yea, kind shrew. I before thee except after C.
  Madeleine: Wouldst thou take a gander underneath my frock?
  Peter: [Stuttering] Sure, whatever floats your boat. There you go.
  Jeez, frickin' perverts.
  Black Knight: Madeleine, go wait in the Hyundai! What were you doing
  with my girl?
  Peter: Jeez, she walks over here and asks me to put a bird in her
  panties! I'm here going, "What the hell?"
  Mort: God! Peter, play dead! Curl up in an ass ball or something!
  Peter: What's the problem, BK?
  Black Knight: I don't like you, I don't like your face, and I don't
  like you hanging around my girl! I don't ever want to see you here
  again!
  Peter: Oh. So, okay, we can see each other outside the Faire, right?
  I'm just trying to understand the rules.
  Black Knight: If I see you again, I'll kill you.
  Peter: Okay, that's much clearer.
  Mort: Oh, God! I think I just miscarried!
  Lois: Peter, what are you doing? I spent hours soldering that costume
  for you.
  Peter: I don't need it anymore, Lois. I quit the team.
  Lois: Quit the team? But you can't quit jousting. The big meet is
  today, and I thought you were...
  Peter: Did you just say "big meet"?
  Lois: Oh, my God! I did.
  Both: [Laughing]
  Lois: We almost missed that one.
  Peter: I know. That was a close one.
  Lois: But I'm being serious here, Peter. We were all set to come see
  you joust today. You were so excited to be on the same field as the
  Black Knight.
  Peter: I'm gonna be watching it from the stands, Lois, because the
  Black Knight is just a big jerk! Just like that guy who fixed our
  vacuum.
  Repairman: There you go. All fixed. Turns out a half-eaten meatball was
  clogging up the intake.
  Peter: Oh. Well, did you save it?
  Repairman: No.
  Peter: You bastard.
  Diane Simmons: Well, it's an exciting day here for all at the
  Renaissance Faire jousting meet. Wouldn't you say, Tom?
  Tom Tucker: Diane, I'd say it was perfect day if you weren't reminding
  us all of our grandmas' cleavage. Now, let's go live to the field where
  Black Knight is preparing to challenge his next opponent.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music] [Cheering]
  Monks: [Chanting "Rock and Roll, Part 2"]
  Stewie: Hey. How're you doing there, big guy? You holding up all right?
  You want a soda? Hmm? Screw it. I tried.
  Man: The Black Knight's next challenger will be Sir Mort Goldman.
  Mort: [Grunting] Oh, God! I forfeit!
  Tom Tucker: That's it, folks. It looks like the Black Knight is out of
  challengers and is once again undefeated.
  Black Knight: Hey, what's your fat ass doing here?
  Man: He's my only means of conveyance. But I guess I do spoil him.
  Black Knight: Clearly you do. And what are you doing here, Griffin? I
  thought I told you never to show your face here again!
  Peter: We're just watching, all right? I don't want any trouble.
  Black Knight: You've got trouble if you don't beat it.
  Peter: Listen, buddy...
  Black Knight: I said get lost!
  Meg: Where's he going?
  Chris: Dad!
  Lois: Let him go, kids.
  Black Knight: You see that, kids? Your father is nothing but a fizzle!
  Peter: Nobody calls me a fizzle and gets away with it!
  [Heroic instrumental music]
  Peter: Except that one guy who called me a fizzle and then ran off. He
  got away with it. But most people who call me a fizzle don't get away
  with it. Well, actually, that guy who got away with it was the only one
  who ever called me a fizzle. After today only half the people who ever
  called me a fizzle will have gotten away with it.
  Tom Tucker: It appears a new challenger has entered the field. The
  crowd has fallen deathly ill-silent. Sorry.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Peter: Oh, my God! I'm gonna die!
  Tom Tucker: To the owner of a yellow Hyundai, your car is being towed.
  Black Knight: What?
  Peter: I won!
  [Cheering]
  Lois: Oh, Peter, that was amazing. You were so brave.
  Chris: Nice going, Dad.
  Peter: Boy! That was lucky about the car, huh?
  Mort: Take that, you bastard! Nobody makes a fool out of Mort Goldman!
  Coach: Spectacular performance, maggot! How would you like to come on
  the road with us as our lead jouster?
  Peter: Thanks, but no thanks, Coach. I've lived my dream. And besides,
  my life is here with my family.
  Chris: But what's Dad gonna do for a job?
  Lois: It'll be okay, Chris. Remember that episode of The Honeymooners
  when Ralph lost his job but at the end of the show he didn't get it bac?
  Peter: What was up with that? That bugged the crap out of me.
  [medieval version of closing theme music]



Title: A Fish Out of Water

Theme Song
  Lois: Peter, this is ridiculous. I know you're upset about losing your
  job, but you've been sitting on that couch for two weeks.
  Peter: I have not, Lois.
  Brian: He's right. It's actually been more like...yeah, 13 days.
  Lois: Well you at least have do something other than sitting there
  eating.
  Peter: All right, all right. Brian, let's go for a walk.
  [Forklift beeping]
  Meg: [Sobbing]
  Lois: Meg, sweetheart, what's wrong?
  Meg: My life. That's what's wrong. I was totally humiliated at school
  today.
  Principal Shepherd: Okay, we're gonna do a little informal survey here,
  kids. Would those of you going away for spring break please move to the
  left of the room? [Repeats request in Spanish]
  Lois: Oh, Meg, what do those kids know?
  Meg: They know how to have a good time.
  Lois: Well, so do we. I'll tell you what. How about you and I have our
  own little spring break? We'll go to that fancy new spa that just
  opened up in Warwick. Massages and facials. Ah! It'll be great. What do
  you say?
  Meg: I guess it couldn't be worse than last year when we all went to
  Sea World.
  Lois: [Laughing]
  Peter: And how long has this been going on?
  [down at the docks]
  Peter: Lois is right. I've been out of work too long.
  Brian: I think you should find something you really enjoy doing. Take
  those guys out there, for example.
  Peter: Where? Oh, yeah. Now, that's a job. Fresh sea air, working
  outside. That's how a real New England man makes a living.
  Brian: Well, maybe that's something to think about, Peter.
  Jake Tucker: What's that, Daddy?
  Tom Tucker: That's Mercury, Jake. The planet closest to the sun. What
  it's doing down here by the wharf, I haven't the foggiest. We should
  probably ask a scientist...
  Peter: I'm a guy, you jackass!
  [Griffin yard]
  Peter: Yeah, that feels good.
  Lois: Chris, don't forget to mist under his chins.
  Stewie: Oh, boy, Lois! It's a real mess down there. I'm afraid I not
  going to be able to do this in the time I quoted you earlier.
  Peter: Chris, shut the hose off for a second. Everybody, I have an
  announcement. I am gonna drop this weight and rejoin the workforce. I
  have decided to become a professional fisherman.
  Lois: What? Why a fisherman?
  Peter: It makes perfect sense, Lois. You know how much time I've spent
  on the ocean.
  [Peter as castaway, adrift on raft]
  Peter: Wilson! What are we gonna do now? Wilson! Wilson!
  Voit: My name is Voit, dumb ass.
  Stewie: Hello, Doreen? Yeah, I'm still over at the Griffin job. Listen,
  tell Walter I'm not going to be able to make it to the construction
  site. I don't know. Have him send Frank, or Glen, or Harelip Steve. I
  know, it creeps me out, too.
  Peter: So you think I can find a boat here, huh, Joe?
  Joe: Yeah. You wouldn't believe what we confiscate from these crooks.
  Auctioneer: Welcome. We open today's bidding with this pair of panties
  confiscated from a prostitute.
  Quagmire: $50!
  Auctioneer: She had nine STDs.
  Quagmire: $45.
  Auctioneer: And when we caught her, she wet herself.
  Quagmire: $50.
  Cleveland: Excuse me. Are you gonna sell anything that's not gross?
  Auctioneer: And now our next item. Please direct your attention to this
  photo of a beautiful 40-foot fishing boat.
  Peter: Oh, man! That's perfect!
  Man: $12,000!
  Peter: $13,000!
  Man 2: $25,000!
  Peter: [Whimpering]
  Auctioneer: Sold for $25,000!
  Man 2: Yes!
  Peter: Crap!
  Man 2: Thanks.
  Auctioneer: And now the actual boat itself. Do I have an opening bid
  for the boat?
  Peter: $50,000!
  Auctioneer: Sold for $50,000!
  Joe: Good for you, Peter.
  [Applause]
  [One person clapping]
  Shamus: Congratulations. You've just bought yourself a cursed boat.
  Peter: Cursed?
  Shamus: The last captain of that vessel lost his life. And it weren't
  no accident! His name was Salty. And he was devoured by Daggermouth,
  the man-eating blowfish. You want to buy that boat? Go ahead. But don't
  expect me to fish your dead body from an angry sea that gave you fair
  warning.
  Peter: Are you up for bids, too? You are just precious.
  Lois: Are you gonna miss me?
  Peter: Only until I go to the newsstand and buy a Hustler.
  Lois: All right, I left you the number for the spa. See you in a few
  days.
  Meg: Not if I strangle myself with a seaweed wrap and die.
  Peter: You are dark!
  Brian: Peter, you haven't told me how you expect to pay for that boat.
  Peter: Don't worry, Brian. There's got to be 100 banks that'll give me
  a loan.
  [Gunfire and screaming]
  Peter: Wow! So, you can really give me a loan?
  Jim Kaplan: I sure can. You see, Mr. Griffin, what sets us apart from
  other banks is that other banks are banks. Now, I trust you have
  collateral.
  Peter: Um, I got three kids.
  Jim Kaplan: I'll take them. Just kidding. Or maybe I'm not. Sign this.
  Here you go. Good luck!
  [Bell ringing]
  Jim Kaplan: So, what do you want on your thigh?
  Biker: I want a skull.
  Jim Kaplan: Okay. Well, I can draw Kermit the Frog. How about a nice
  Kermit the Frog?
  Biker: No. I want a skull.
  Jim Kaplan: Okay, well, I'm gonna go ahead and do Kermit the Frog.
  Meg: Mom, this is so lame.
  Lois: Come on, Meg. Try to have fun. I promise after a few days here
  you won't even remember the words "spring break". How about some TV?
  MTV VJ: This is MTV and we're rocking at spring break!
  VH1 VJ: This is VH1 and we're rocking at spring break.
  Bernard Shaw: ...leaving thousands injured. For CNN, I'm Bernard
  Shaw...keeping it real and kicking ass at spring break! Whoo!
  Meg: [sighing]
  Peter: There she is, boys. The S.S. More Powerful than Superman,
  Batman, Spiderman, and the Incredible Hulk Put Together.
  Hennessey: Yes, she's a fine vessel. Welcome to the wharf. Name's
  Hennessey.
  Peter: Hi there. Peter Griffin. My friends call me Peter for short.
  Hennessey: I'll let you in on a little secret, neighbor. The best
  fishing is at latitude 42, longitude 71. Keep that to yourself.
  Peter: Oh, wow! Thanks. I'll see you, fellows. I got some fish to
  catch. Let's see. Latitude 42, longitude 71. This is it. What the hell?
  Boy: Papa, he killed Mordecai the Dancing Yiddish Clown!
  Father: Stop crying! You just became a man. Now, act like one!
  Peter: Hey, Hennessey, what's the big idea sending me to that Bar
  Mitzvah?
  Hennessey: Because I don't like you! And I don't like your face! We
  don't need any more fishermen crowding up this wharf!
  Peter: Oh, well, fine, Hennessey! You want an enemy, you got one!
  Hennessey: Fine!
  Stewie: There we are. Hey, Steve, you ever think of growing a moustache?
  Hennessey: Nice fish you got there, Griffin. What are you selling? Your
  bait?
  Peter: Nice face, Hennessey. Yes! Me, one. You, zero. Hey!
  Man: Wow! How do you do it?
  Peter: You're very nice to ask. First I hang the old worm out there.
  They usually go for it. So, I jerk them around a little. They fight for
  a while. And then they just lay back and accept it.
  Man: How about we get together later?
  Peter: Um, okay. What the hell? Oh, damn it! Hey! What's going on here?
  Brian: Peter, did you read the fine print on this loan contract?
  Peter: If by "read" you mean "imagined a naked lady," then yes.
  Brian: Peter, listen, the bank's taking all our stuff. And according to
  this if you don't pay them within 48 hours, they get the house, too.
  Chris: Oh, boy! I get to go live at the bank!
  Lois: Meg, Did I ever tell you that if you're on birth control and you
  take an antibiotic it makes it not work? Because no one told me. I
  thought you should know.
  Meg: Look, Mom, I don't really feel like talking right now. Okay?
  Lois: Fine. I just don't understand why we had to leave the spa so
  early.
  Meg: Look, I just want to go home and spend the next three days in
  solitary confinement where I belong!
  Lois: [sighing] Well, I tried.
  Meg: Mom, what the hell are we doing here?
  Lois: This is where you wanted to be. Right, honey?
  Meg: Yeah. But not with you!
  Spring Breaker: Hey, did you hear what happened to the dude from UMass?
  He got so drunk he fell off his hotel balcony! He's in a coma!
  Spring Breaker 2: Oh, man! I want to party with him!
  Spring Breaker: You know it! Yeah!
  Spring Breakers: [Intense hollering]
  Connie: Hey, look. Meg made it, you guys.
  Cool girl: Yeah. And she brought her mommy.
  Meg: Oh, my God!
  Lois: Come on, Meg! Get out of the car! Like the kids say, up your nose
  with a rubber hose!
  Spring Breaker: Hey, look, everybody. It's Spuds MacKenzie! [Screaming]
  Brian: That's the last of the furniture.
  Peter: No TV. I miss my friends. John Ritter, and Florence Henderson,
  and Alfonso Ribeiro.
  Brian: Is he the guy from Silver Spoons?
  Peter: Um, no, well, he was on French Prince of Bel-Air....
  Brian: Fresh Prince.
  Peter: Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. But I don't know if he was also on...
  Hey, Alfonso.
  Alfonso Ribeiro: Yeah?
  Peter: Were you on Silver Spoons?
  Alfonso Ribeiro: Yes, I was.
  Peter: Oh, there you go.
  Lois: Come on. Just a little higher, honey.
  Meg: Mom, I don't think I can...
  Spring Breaker: Hey, who's holding Lois?
  Spring Breaker 2: I don't know. Some dude named Mel.
  Carson Daly: This is Carson Daly. And we're live here at spring break.
  Who wants to party? Okay, one, two, three, four, five.... Okay, we're
  gonna need cake and juice for 14 people. All right, now let's go to Tom
  Green who's gonna do something really outrageous!
  Tom Green: Does anyone out there like me yet? Can I stop this?
  Peter: Hey, what the hell are you doing in my house?
  Jim: Your house? This is my house. My wife and I bought it from the
  bank.
  Peter: I still got another day to pay back the loan.
  Jim: The bank said it wouldn't matter because you're a fat deadbeat
  loser.
  Peter: Fat deadbeat loser? Well, sir, while I may not agree with what
  you say, I'll defend to the death your right to say it.
  Abby: There we are. It's a van Gogh print. Isn't it beautiful?
  Stewie: Oh, yes, I've often fantasized about what this house would be
  like with more culture.
  [Griffin men all in morning coats and top hats]
  Stewie: The port is quite good.
  Brian: Quite good.
  Chris: Indeed.
  Peter: Most certainly.
  Brian: What year is it?
  Chris: '51.
  Peter: Ah.
  Stewie: Delectable.
  Brian: Indeed.
  Chris: Yes.
  Peter: Oh, dear!
  Brian: What is it?
  Peter: I've spontaneously combusted.
  Stewie: well, I am Sorry.
  Peter: Oh, it's quite all right. I'm tired of living.
  Stewie: Ah, very good then.
  Chris: For the best.
  Brian: Yes, indeed.
  Stewie: Is it raining again?
  Rabbi: Did you hear the one about us?
  Connie: Wow! You are such a good dancer.
  Cool girl: Way to go on that beer bong.
  Cool guy: Yeah, no fake. No fake.
  Meg: Mom!
  Lois: Hey! What are you doing here?
  Meg: What am I doing here? I've been waiting out here for hours!
  Lois: What?
  Meg: You were supposed to pop inside "real quick" and find someone who
  looked enough like me so I could use their ID. And then you were
  supposed to come out and give me the ID so I could get inside.
  Lois: What?
  Meg: God, it's like talking to a 3-year-old!
  Lois: Oh, you know what? You need to learn how to loosen up a little,
  toots.
  Meg: Yeah, I get the feeling you're loose enough for us both.
  Lois: What?
  Meg: Nothing.
  Lois: That's right nothing. Don't you sass me!
  [Phone ringing]
  Chris: Good evening. Stevenson residence.
  Meg: Chris, honey, we've been over this a thousand times. It's
  pronounced "Griffin."
  Chris: Hi, Mom!
  Lois: Hi, Chris. Put your father on.
  Chris: Hey, Dad?
  Jim: And the French guy says, "Deodorant? What's that?"
  Stewie: All right. All right. I've got one. I've got one. Okay. Two men
  are standing at the Pearly Gates. Oh, God, wait! How did that one go?
  Oh, well, anyway, it turns out they're Siegfried and Roy. I'm no good
  at telling jokes.
  Chris: Dad, it's Mom.
  Peter: Oh, God! Please be Somerset Maugham. Please be Somerset Maugham.
  Hello?
  Lois: Peter?
  Peter: Damn!
  Lois: I was just calling to check in with my boys, see how you guys are
  doing.
  Peter: We're fine.
  Lois: What's all the noise?
  Peter: Nothing. Nothing. [plays tape recording of Lois speaking]
  "Peter, I need you to take out the trash!" Okay, Lois! Lois, I got to
  go! Holy crap, Brian! What am I gonna do? Lois is gonna be home in a
  couple of days and we're getting kicked out of the house tomorrow.
  Brian: What do you suggest?
  Peter: Get out your ring.
  Brian: Peter, that's not gonna...
  Peter: Come on!
  Both: Wonder Twin powers, activate!
  Peter: Form of steam!
  Brian: Peter, we got these in a box of Franken Berry.
  Jim: A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal! It looks like a jackal! Jackal?
  Jackal? It's a jackal! Jackal?
  Abby: Time!
  Stewie: It wasn't right the first time you said it! Why the hell would
  it be right the next 10 times? God!
  Peter: Oh, man, I am screwed! I'm gonna lose my house, and my boat, and
  everything. How am I gonna come up with $50,000 by tomorrow?
  Quagmire: Well, you could whore yourself out to 1,000 fat chicks for
  $50 apiece. Or 50 really fat chicks for $1,000. What? Don't look at me
  like that. Fat chicks need love, too. But they got to pay.
  Peter: What is this?
  Waitress: Sea water, courtesy of that gentleman over there.
  Hennessey: You need $50,000, Griffin? I got a suggestion for you. Why
  don't you kill Daggermouth?
  Peter: Maybe I will, Hennessey.
  Shamus: You'd be buying yourself a one-way ticket to a watery grave.
  Daggermouth is the meanest, most ruthless creature that's ever
  inhabited the sea. Legend has it he dwells out by Fish Stench Cove.
  He'll kill any man that comes near there. I saw him once. Sure I'm
  blind in one eye, and my other eye was infected that day from picking
  at it, and I was tired, and I'd been swimming in a pool with too much
  chlorine, and that was the hour my glasses were at Lenscrafters but I
  seen that fish!
  Peter: If there's $50,000 in it, I don't think I got a choice.
  Shamus: You can whore yourself out to 1,000 fat chicks for $50.
  Quagmire: Nah, nah, we covered that.
  Hennessey: You ain't got a chance, Griffin. Daggermouth killed my
  friend Salty. And he was twice the fisherman you are. And half the
  weight!
  Peter: Hey-no! No! Hot!
  Joe: He's right, Peter. It'd be suicide to go after that fish. There's
  gotta be another way.
  Cleveland: We could have a bake sale.
  Quagmire: Oh, now, see, I think that's a neat idea.
  Peter: No! I am not gonna let my family live on the street. Not even if
  it means ending up like Shamus here. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a
  date with destiny.
  Quagmire: So, were you like, in an accident, or what?
  Shamus: No. Me father was a tree.
  Peter: What's wrong with me? I got to be crazy to think I can kill that
  man-eating fish. I mean, what the hell am I doing?
  Jim: Hey, hey, hey, come on, Peter. What kind of talk is that?
  Abby: Yeah, you can do it. Who's my big brave boy, huh?
  Peter: Me.
  Abby: Who's my big brave boy?
  Peter: Me.
  Abby: [blowing raspberries on Peter's stomach]
  [Rock music playing]
  Meg: This sucks, Mom.
  Lois: Meg, stop moping. These are the best years of your life. Now,
  let's get up there and live a little, huh?
  Meg: Mom, I look like an idiot!
  Lois: No, you don't. Come on. Just move your hips a little like this.
  Crowd: [Chanting] Lois! Lois! Lois!
  Lois: Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
  Crowd: Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
  Lois: Atta girl! Shake your moneymaker!
  Crowd: Meg! Meg! Meg!
  Man: Oh, my God! It's a chick!
  school janitor: [Repeating in Spanish]
  Cop: All right, everybody! This party's over!
  Man: Why do you cops always have to kill our buzz?
  Cop: He used a teenage colloquialism. Get the tear gas.
  [Screaming]
  Joe: Not so fast, big guy.
  Peter: What are you guys doing here?
  Cleveland: We're gonna help you kill the fish.
  Peter: But this is gonna be dangerous. We could all die.
  Quagmire: Oh, come on. You're our best friend, Peter. Besides, I can
  remember a time when you saved all our butts.
  Peter: Yeah, too bad I didn't get there until after the sodomy. All
  right, let's go kick some fish ass!
  [Lively cheering]
  [Siren wailing]
  Meg: I can't believe I just showed everyone my tater tots. Worst of
  all, now I'm gonna have a police record.
  Lois: Now, Meg, if you're gonna grab ahold of life, you've gotta expect
  to get your hands dirty once in a while.
  Meg: It was kind of cool that people noticed me.
  Lois: That's the spirit, honey. Okay, one, two, three, tuck and roll!
  Peter: We're right on course, guys. Give me another beer.
  Joe: You know, these are the precious moments. The four of us out at
  sea, miles away from civilization, tossing back brews.
  Peter: Amen to that, Joe. Hey, you guys, here's one for you. Let's say
  none of us were married, all right? If you could have any woman in the
  world, who would it be?
  Joe: Mariel Hemingway.
  Peter: Come on. Really?
  Cleveland: Not a very good choice.
  Quagmire: She's jagged.
  Joe: No. I think she's very attractive in a classical kind of way.
  Quagmire: Yeah, but you could cut a roast on her face.
  Cleveland: I would go with Margaret Thatcher.
  All: Margaret Thatcher?
  Peter: Why the hell Margaret Thatcher?
  Cleveland: Oh, so nobody here thinks power is sexy? Not one of you
  finds power sexy?
  Joe: How about you, Peter?
  Peter: Oh, like you got to ask. The chick with three knockers from
  Total Recall.
  Joe: Interesting.
  Cleveland: I never saw that movie.
  Quagmire: Hey, you know one was papier-mâché,
  right?
  Peter: Oh, jeez, can I change my answer? Of course I know it's paper! I
  don't care! What's wrong with you? What about you, Quagmire?
  Quagmire: Taylor Hanson.
  Joe: Taylor Hanson's a guy.
  Quagmire: You guys are yanking me. Hey, let's put one over on old
  Quagmire.
  Peter: No, he's actually a guy, Quagmire.
  Quagmire: Well, well, this is insane! That's impossible! Oh, my God,
  Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God! I got all these magazines. Oh, God!
  Oh, God!
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Joe: [gasping] This must be Fish Stench Cove.
  Peter: All right. Now all we got to do is find the fish.
  Terry Jones: I wonder where that fish did go. A fish, a fish, a fishy,
  oh.
  Joe: I heard that when Daggermouth eats you, he devours your guts first.
  Cleveland: I heard he doesn't just eat you, he eats your soul!
  Peter: I heard one of Shannen Doherty's eyes is off-center 'cause it's
  trying to escape!
  Daggermouth: Welcome, gentlemen!
  Quagmire: It's him! Quick, shoot him!
  Daggermouth: Not so fast! Perhaps I could offer you a glass of port.
  And you a glass of starboard. That's a little nautical joke. I'm a
  fish, you see. I'm also delightfully mad. Oh dear, would you mind
  holding still for a moment? These antique pistols take about ten
  minutes to reload.
  Joe: Peter, catch!
  Peter: Ow! Don't throw stuff at me, Joe!
  Cleveland: Peter, shoot him!
  Peter: Oh, yeah. Right. My God! Isn't it amazing that that's what we
  all look like on the inside?
  Salty: It's a robot, you idiot.
  Joe: Who are you?
  Salty: I'm Salty.
  Peter: Salty? But everybody said you were killed by that fish.
  Salty: That's what I wanted them to think. I disappeared and spread the
  Daggermouth rumor myself.
  Peter: Why?
  Salty: Merchandise! Daggermouth t-shirts, mugs, posters. And I'm in
  talks with Nickelodeon for a cartoon show. Figured I'd pair him with an
  effeminate cat. What do you think?
  Peter: I'd watch that.
  Joe: Sure, sure
  Quagmire: Me, too.
  Cleveland: Sounds like a good balance.
  Salty: And now I'm gonna give you $50,000 to be on your way.
  Peter: $50,000? For what?
  Salty: To keep your mouth shut! And because the longer we stay here the
  more people'll question how a fisherman with no engineering background
  managed to build a sophisticated talking fish robot.
  Lois: Honey, I'm really sorry for how I acted. Getting so drunk, and
  ditching you at the bar and letting those boys take pictures of you
  while you were sleeping. I was so busy having fun, I guess I kind of
  ruined it for you.
  [Car honking]
  Lois: Uh-oh, we got company.
  Meg: Looks like your fans are back, Mom.
  Cool kids: Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
  Lois: No, I think this one's all yours.
  [Cheering]
  Cool girl: You go, girl!
  Cool boy 1: All right!
  Cool boy 2: One's an innie, and one's an outie.
  Announcer: And now, back to Daggermouth and Boom Boom on Nickelodeon.
  Daggermouth: Boom Boom, did you do your exercises today?
  Boom Boom: Yes. I did 20 laps. And I'm about to do 20 more!
  Daggermouth: Oh, you!
  Boom Boom: Yipes!
  [Whimsical instrumental music]
  Lois: Oh, Peter, I'm so glad being a fisherman is working out for you.
  You know I gotta admit I half expected to come home, and all our stuff
  would be gone, and we'd owe somebody a whole lot of money.
  Peter: How can you "half expect" something?
  Lois: I don't know. It's just a turn of phrase.
  Peter: How do you "turn a phrase"?
  Lois: God, you're dumb! Thank God for that ass! Now, come here and kiss
  me. Good night, honey.
  Peter: Good night, Lois. Good night, Jim and Abby.
  Jim & Abby: Good night.
  [Abby blowing raspberries]
  Peter: [laughing] Not now, Abby.
  [closing theme music]



Title: Emission Impossible

Theme Song
  Stewie: Oh, let's see. We got soda, purple stuff. Oh, Sunny D! All
  right!
  Announcer: We now return to The Smurfs.
  Smurf 1: You have a good time last night?
  Smurf 2: Smurftacular.
  Smurf 1: Yeah, I saw you leave with Smurfette.
  Smurf 2: Oh man, as soon as we got out of the bar, she started smurfing
  me.
  Smurf 1: Shut the smurf up!
  Smurf 2: Yeah!
  Smurf 1: Right in the smurfin' parking lot?
  Smurf 2: Smurf yeah!
  Smurf 1: Oh, that is freakin' smurf.
  Smurf 2: You smurf it.
  Smurf 1: That is freakin' smurf.
  Smurf 2: Yeah.
  [Phone rings]
  Lois: Hello? Oh, my God! Peter, why are you staring into the dryer?
  Peter: I'm watching the latest episode of Laundry Theater. See? Now,
  those are Chris' socks, right? They don't know that Stewie's shirt is
  having an affair with Meg's trousers. Ooh, it's fun to watch rich
  people be naughty!
  Lois: Peter, listen to me. My sister just called. Her baby's due any
  day now and Ted just walked out on her.
  Peter: Whoa, whoa. Back it up, back it up. You have a sister?
  Lois: I promised her I'd be on the next train. Poor Carol. All alone in
  that big house.
  Peter: Wait a minute. Carol. Carol. Is she the one with the Jacuzzi and
  the pool table?
  Lois: Yeah.
  Peter: Better come with you.
  Lois: Really? Well, that's a surprise.
  Peter: Oh, come on, Lois. When have I not been there for you?
  Carjacker 1: Get out of the damn car, now!
  Carjacker 2: Scream and you're dead!
  Peter: Thanks for the ride, lady!
  [Doorbell ringing]
  Quagmire: Hey, it's the Griffins! What can I do for you?
  Lois: Glen, we have a family emergency. We need you to take the kids
  for just a couple days.
  Quagmire: Well, in accordance with Megan's law, I'm obligated to inform
  you that...you know what, that's fine. I'll take the kids.
  Peter: Aw, thanks, buddy.
  Quagmire: Gosh! I've never had to entertain kids before. So a chick
  walks into a gynecologist's office...[Makes ridiculous noises] [Makes
  baby noises]
  Lois: Don't worry. We'll get you through this. In a few days you'll
  have a beautiful baby. And you can smother it with all your unrequited
  love.
  Carol: As soon as the baby can crawl, it'll probably leave me, too just
  like my eight husbands.
  Peter: Hey, Carol. It's me, Ted. Listen, I came back because I love
  you. I'm just kidding. It's me, Peter.
  Carol: It was so nice of you to come, Peter. You're so considerate.
  Peter: It was nothing.
  [Crash] [Furniture being dragged]
  Chris: Mr. Quagmire! I finished the scavenger hunt!
  Quagmire: Whoa, whoa, hold your horses, hold your horses. Let's go down
  the list. An unsharpened pencil?
  Chris: Check!
  Quagmire: A speed-limit sign that doesn't end in 5 or 0?
  Chris: Check!
  Quagmire: Your mom's hairbrush?
  Chris: Check!
  Quagmire: You win!
  Chris: Boy! What's my prize?
  Quagmire: A pencil and a speed sign!
  Chris: I did it!
  Quagmire: I'll be right back. A couple of teeth and toenail clippings
  and we'll be ready for our date!
  Peter: Hey, Carol? Since Ted dumped you, can I have his shirts?
  Lois: Peter, what are you gonna do with Ted's shirts? He's half your
  size.
  Peter: I know, I know, I know. But check this out. Hey, Carol. Say,
  "David Banner, I just slashed your tires."
  Carol: "David Banner, I just slashed your tires."
  Peter: [Angry screaming] I'm priceless.
  Lois: Peter, sit with Carol. I'm gonna use the ladies' room.
  Carol: Does she still take the newspaper in there?
  Peter: Yeah. And after she does, I just can't read it.
  Carol: [Screaming] Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here any minute! We
  had better get moving!
  Peter: Carol, you got to relax. You let that kid start calling the
  shots now and you're screwed.
  Chris: Is Mr. Quagmire babysitting all these people, too?
  Quagmire: Hey, if I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put "U" and "l"
  together. You must be a parking ticket because you got "fine" written
  all over you. Hey there. I don't want to come between you. Or do I? Oh,
  that's awful. That's awful.
  Stewie: This is a song I've been singing for a number of years. I find
  it grows truer and truer as time goes by. [plays "Hungry Eyes" by Eric
  Carmen] ? Hungry eyes ? ? I feel the magic between you and I ? Ooh, I'm
  hungry for you, baby. Come on. Walk with me. Talk with me. [Smacks
  woman's butt]
  [Honking]
  Carol: [Panting]
  Lois: Don't worry, Carol. We're almost there. Peter, why are we stopped?
  Peter: Um, yeah, I'll have three cheeseburgers.
  Lois: For God's sake! She's having a baby!
  Peter: That's right. And a kid's meal. And I guess I'll have fries. If
  I have fries, is anybody else gonna have any? Because I don't want to
  be the only one eating them; I'll feel like a fatty.
  Lois: Nurse! This woman is in labor!
  Mayor West: Excuse me. I was here first. My leg is asleep.
  Doctor: All right, let's see what we have here. Oh, the baby's crowning.
  Carol: [Yelling]
  Doctor: I'm just going to put on a pair of gloves and we'll deliver
  this baby. These don't feel like gloves at all. They feel like used
  needles. But this is where I always keep the gloves. Maybe if I dig
  deeper. Nope. Just feels like more needles. That's the craziest thing.
  Oh, now I'm sure this isn't the glove drawer.
  Carol: My God! Who's gonna deliver my baby?
  Lois: Honey, do something!
  Peter: No baby. But it looks like Carol's blowing a bubble.
  Lois: Peter, that's the head! Push! Push!
  Peter: I am! It won't go back in!
  Lois: Not you, Peter! Carol, push! Peter, you pull!
  Peter: Oh, my God!
  Lois: What? What?
  Peter: It's a beautiful baby girl.
  Carol: A baby girl. I'm so happy.
  Peter: But she has a penis. Well, we'll have to do something about that.
  Lois: Peter, no! It's a boy!
  Peter: Well, how do you like that? Hey there, little fella. Welcome to
  the planet Earth. Kitchy kitchy kitchy koo. [Baby passes gas] He takes
  after his Uncle Peter.
  Lois: Peter, he's Carol's baby. Give him to her.
  Peter: Oh, yeah.
  Lois: Honey, you were fantastic. And you were so cute when you were
  holding it.
  Peter: I know. I didn't want to give it up.
  Lois: Yeah?
  Peter: Let's steal it.
  Lois: What?
  Peter: No, wait. I got a better idea. Lois, let's have another baby.
  Lois: What? Sweetie, you're not serious?
  Peter: I sure am. The best thing I've ever done with my life is being a
  dad.
  Lois: Oh, Peter. I think it's a wonderful idea.
  Doctor: Why haven't you sent for help?
  Meg: I can't believe you guys want to have another kid!
  Lois: Peter, did you find Chris and Meg's baby books?
  Peter: Not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois. It's our pet rock. I remember
  the first day we brought it home. [flashback] See that? Bad rock. Bad.
  We do that outside! Look at him. He knows what he did.
  Chris: I found my baby book! Here's the broken condom that led to my
  birth.
  Lois: And the resulting lawsuit bought us this house. You're my
  favorite mistake.
  Chris: You see, Meg? I'm the favorite!
  Stewie: Ah, baby books. Nostalgic for the days of chafed nipples and
  episiotomies?
  Lois: Somebody hasn't heard the news.
  Stewie: News? What news?
  Lois: What's the most wonderful thing that could happen to this family?
  [Stewie fantasy-family sitting around living room with Lois as a
  stuffed rug on the floor]
  Stewie: The Phillies won.
  Peter: You're gonna have a baby brother, buddy.
  Lois: Or sister.
  Stewie: A new baby. That's wonderful. Call me when Kojak starts. What?
  [Rupert as psychiatrist; Stewie on the couch]
  Stewie:Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why the deuce would they want to
  replace me? My cheeks are pinchable. My bottom is smooth. My laugh is
  heartwarming. [laughs] What's that? I certainly am not overreacting!
  What the devil do you think happened to Bobby when they added Cousin
  Oliver to The Brady Bunch?
  Mrs. Brady: Oliver, did you break this vase?
  Oliver: No. The floor did.
  Peter: He's so cute.
  Bobby: Hey, everybody. I...
  Mr. Brady: Bobby, you get back in the garage!
  Stewie: It can't happen! I was here first! well, technically, third but
  no time for semantics. This is Stewie Country and I intend to keep it
  that way! As God is my witness, from this day forward Peter and Lois
  shall not conceive!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Stewie: What are you doing here?
  Brian: Uh, Peter and Lois are, uh, getting intimate.
  Stewie: My God! I thought I had more time! I've got to stop them!
  Stewie: [Fake crying] Mommy! Daddy! I had a bad dream! I saw the....
  Blast! What the devil is that name again? Bogeyman! Yes. That's it. I
  saw the bogeyman.
  Lois: Aw, did someone have a bad dream? Why don't you sleep with Mommy
  and Daddy? Peter, for God's sakes! Stewie's right here!
  Peter: Come on, Lois, we can still do it. He'll just think I'm hurting
  you.
  Lois: Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.
  Stewie: Roll over. Roll over, I say! [Muffled yelping] Smells like
  cheese.
  Brian: Okay. "Insert Rod Support A into Slot B."
  Peter: That's what...
  Brian: And if you say "That's what she said" one more time, I'm gonna
  pop you.
  Joe: What you building there, neighbor?
  Peter: Well, we were keeping it a secret, but you guys are my best
  friends, so I'll tell you. Lois and I are having another baby!
  Guys: [Girlish shrieking]
  Quagmire: We are so throwing you a shower!
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Stewie: Well, fat man, we'll see if Lois wants to have sexual relations
  when she finds lipstick on your collar. There we are. Well! Look at you
  there. You're a filthy girl, aren't you? Yes, you're looking for a bad
  time. That's what you're after. You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad.
  You don't care where you get it from. You have no self-respect, and
  that gets you off, doesn't it?
  Lois: Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's makeup! You got it all over your
  father's favorite shirt. Now, go to your room!
  Brian: Wow. The evidence is really piling up.
  Stewie: Make any joke you want. You know I look good.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Stewie: My God! They're at it again! All this time spent keeping people
  from having sex! Now I know how the Catholic Church feels. Ba-zing!
  Time to initiate Phase Two.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Stewie: All right. Testing voice modulator. "Blast you, vile woman!"
  Peter robot: Blast you, vile woman!
  Stewie: Oh, that won't do. "Pardon me, you with the severe aesthetic
  deficiencies."
  Peter: Hey, ugly.
  Stewie: Excellent! [Maniacal laughter]
  Peter: Sweet.
  Peter: Who's got beer?
  Lois: Where'd you go, my little pumpkin eater?
  Peter robot: To the can, because kissing you made me barf.
  Lois: What?
  Chris: Dad, Meg keeps pushing me!
  Meg: Oh, like I could! He's so fat!
  Chris: I'm not fat! I'm Rubenesque!
  Peter robot: That's it. Your dad's had enough. I want you kids to go
  downstairs and drink the antifreeze in the garage.
  Chris: I'm gonna chug it all so there's none left for you!
  Meg: Hey, watch it!
  Lois: Peter!
  Peter: What?
  Cleveland: Hey, Peter. I see nothing. Nothing.
  Lois: I've had it with these interruptions! All we want is a little
  time alone! Go to your rooms for the rest of the night.
  Chris: I don't want to go to my room. There's an evil monkey in my
  closet!
  Peter: "Evil monkey." Right.
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Lois: This romantic dinner was a wonderful idea, Peter.
  Peter: Ah, you deserve it, my beautiful princess.
  Lois: [laughing] You know, I'm not wearing any panties.
  Peter: Don't worry. We can always throw that chair out.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Stewie: Very well then. If I can't stop them from the outside I'll stop
  them from the inside! Oh, dear! I'm afraid you're in a no-fly zone. As
  was your fate, Mr. Fly, so is the fate of every sperm in Peter's body!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Stewie: Computer on.
  Computer: 30 minutes to re-expansion.
  Stewie: Just enough time to obliterate all those little potential
  usurpers. Engine status?
  Computer: Nominal.
  Stewie: Fuel supply?
  Computer: Full.
  Stewie: Air Supply?
  ["Lost in Love" by Air Supply plays]
  Stewie: Very well. Through the lips, over the gums. Look out testicles,
  here I come!
  Peter: ? Lois ? ? You can't spell love without L-O ? ? You can't spell
  is without I-S ? ? You can't spell silo without Lois ? And solo from
  the pet rock! Oh no no no, oh, oh god, oh god.
  Computer: Warning. Host's oxygen levels rising. Heart rate increasing.
  Stewie: Oh, my God! Either they're watching Batman or they're "doing
  the Dew"!
  [Theme from Batman on TV]
  Stewie: If I'm to reach the testicles and destroy the sperm before
  coitus, I must buy some time.. Computer, location?
  Computer: Fifteen millimeters northeast of the duodenum.
  Stewie: Very well. Fire phasers!
  Peter: Oh, jeez, my duodenum's acting up!
  Computer: Entering testicular perimeter.
  Stewie: Do you know what today is? A bad day to be a sperm.
  [Lasers firing]
  Stewie: What the deuce? Well, it seems you are out of ammunition.
  Bertram: As are you, Stewart!
  Stewie: You know my name!
  Bertram: I know many things.
  Stewie: Indeed?
  Bertram: Quite.
  Stewie: Yes.
  Bertram: Mmm.
  Stewie: well, perhaps we should exchange monosyllabic expressions of
  arrogance in person.
  Bertram: Mmmm.
  Stewie: Mmmm.
  Bertram: Yes.
  [Monosyllabic grunting]
  Lois: Peter, I'm waiting.
  Peter: I'm coming.
  [Latin instrumental music]
  Stewie: You came unarmed?
  Bertram: As we agreed.
  Stewie: Admirable. But foolish! It's going to be a shame to destroy
  such a worthy adversary.
  Bertram: My thoughts exactly.
  Stewie: I've got you in the sleeper hold!
  Bertram: As I you.
  Stewie: Your attempts to escape are futile. Well, well. Naptime appears
  to be over.
  Bertram: Go ahead! Finish me off! My one regret is that I won't be able
  to do away with that red-headed woman.
  Stewie: What the.... How the devil do you know about Lois?
  Bertram: You've seen that little gleam in the fat man's eye? That
  twinkle? That's me plotting my escape.
  Stewie: You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too. What else do you hate?
  Bertram: People who send pictures of their families as Christmas cards!
  Stewie: Ooh, ooh, people who use the word "guesstimate."
  Bertram: Guys who wear sandals with socks!
  Both: Jason Patric! Ooo!
  Stewie: You know, perhaps I've been looking at this the wrong way. I
  daresay I should embrace the idea of having a little brother. After
  all, it's obvious we'd make quite a formidable team.
  [Whimsical instrumental music]
  Computer: [beeping] Two minutes to re-expansion.
  Stewie: Dear God! I'll never get out in time!
  Bertram: Move aside! I know a shortcut!
  Lois: [Moaning]
  Peter: [Moaning]
  Lois: [Choking]
  Computer: Re-expansion in 60 seconds.
  Bertram: There's the tear duct. We've got to make him cry.
  Stewie: I think I know just the way. All right. Follow my lead.
  [Joe Cocker's "Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong" begins playing]
  Stewie: ? Love lift us up where we belong ? ? Where the eagles fly, on
  a mountain high ?
  Both: ? Love lift us up where we belong ?
  Lois: Peter, I love you.
  Peter: And I love you, Lou Gossett, Jr.
  Stewie: It worked! Hurry, get down there so you can be born!
  Computer: Ten seconds to re-expansion.
  Bertram: I guess this is good-bye.
  Stewie: For now. Oh, when you're born, don't let the doctor slap you on
  the ass. It degrades us all.
  [honking to "Shave and a Haircut"]
  Stewie: Give it to her good, old man!
  Lois: Peter, wait. I've been thinking. It's been a long time since we
  had such a wonderful night. And it's gonna be impossible to spend time
  together like this if we're raising another child.
  Peter: Well, I thought, you know, Brian would kind of do a lot of the
  work.
  Lois: I don't know. I mean, Stewie alone needs so much attention. Maybe
  we should hold off on having another baby.
  Peter: You may be right.
  Stewie: No! No, no! You must receive his seed!
  Lois: Look who's here.
  Peter: But, Lois, we still get to do it, right?
  Lois: Honey, not in front of Stewie.
  Peter: Okay. Back in a minute.
  Stewie: No! Come back here this instant, you fat bastard and do her!
  Stop it. Stop tickling me. I'll kill you. I swear to God. What did you
  just do?
  Peter: [Sighing]
  Stewie: No! You killed my brother! How could you, you...oh, my God! The
  twinkle. He's alive. Well played, sperm brother. He's more clever than
  I thought. Perhaps too clever.
  [Chilling instrumental music]
  [closing theme music]



Title: To Love and Die in Dixie

Theme Song
  Barbara: Hi, Chris.
  Chris: [Hyperventilating] Hi, Barbara.
  Barbara: I'm having a birthday party next week. I was hoping you could
  come.
  Chris: Oh, no! Someone peed in my pants!
  Barbara: You're funny. Well, I hope you can make it.
  [Crickets chirping]
  Lois: Your friend's birthday party sounds like fun, Chris.
  Peter: Yeah, but, I hope for your sake, the cake's better than the last
  party I went to.
  Stripper: [Screaming]
  Peter: Oh, God! Coconut!
  Chris: I want to get Barbara a really nice gift. What kind of gifts
  have boys gotten for you, Meg?
  Meg: Oh, well...my boyfriend, Prince William, got me this beautiful
  watch and this diamond tiara, and this wonderful scepter. [Manic
  laughter] [Sobbing]
  Stewie: She needs to get laid big-time.
  Peter: Listen, Chris, I read a book saying that women are from Venus,
  all right? So, here's what you get her. Thick layers of sulfuric acid,
  viscous surface rock and coronae which seem to be collapsed domes over
  large magma chambers. Here's $5.
  Chris: Well, that's okay, Dad. I was thinking about getting a paper
  route, so I could pay for Barbara's gift myself.
  Lois: Oh, well, I think that's very sweet, honey.
  Peter: Oh, boy! I remember my first job. I was in a folk-music trio.
  [flashback] Hey, how about "Here's to you, Mrs. Fleckenstein"?
  Paul Simon: You've been pitching that for an hour, but it's just not a
  very attractive name.
  Peter: Fine, fine. I suppose we're also not going with "Parsley, Sage,
  Rosemary, and Lowrey's Seasoning Salt." That's it. I'm going to 'Nam.
  Herbert: Well, hey there, young fella. Bringing me good news today?
  Chris: What?
  Herbert: Come on over here, son. Hand me the paper, so I don't need to
  use my grabber. That's a nice muscly throwing arm you got there.
  Chris: Thanks.
  Herbert: Got a nice tip for you right here in my pocket. But my
  arthritis.... Why don't you reach in there and fish it out for yourself?
  Chris: Oh, that's okay, mister. I don't collect until the end of the
  month. I'll see you tomorrow. Weird.
  [Pop music playing]
  Chris: I hope you like it.
  Barbara: Wow, perfume! That is so sweet.
  Chris: It'll make you smell like Elizabeth Taylor. I guess that means
  you'll smell like bourbon and Vicodin.
  Barbara: That's very thoughtful.
  Chris: Can I spray some on you?
  Barbara: Oh, my eyes!
  Chris: You're beautiful!
  Barbara: Just get away from me, Chris!
  Chris: I'm so awkward!
  Herbert: Hey, muscly arm, why the long face?
  Chris: It's this girl. I can't talk to her. It's like girls are a
  different species or something.
  Herbert: Who needs them? You like Popsicles?
  Chris: Well, sure.
  Herbert: Then you need to come on down to the cellar. I got a whole
  freezer full of Popsicles. Mmmm....
  Chris: No, thanks. I gotta get going.
  Herbert: Don't make me beg, now.
  Chris: You're funny. Bye.
  Herbert: Get your fat ass back here.
  Robber: This is a holdup! Open the register!
  Clerk: I can't! It only opens when you make a sale!
  Robber: Then give me one of them horoscope scrolls and some Skittles!
  "Financial transaction benefits you today." Ooh!
  Clerk: Weird!
  [Suspenseful instrumental music] [Sirens wailing]
  Robber: All right, a bike! I'm out of here!
  Cop: Now, son, your parents are on their way. But since time is a
  factor here, we'd like to get a positive ID as quickly as possible.
  Chris: Are you sure he can't see me?
  Cop: Absolutely, Chris. You're 100 percent safe.
  Chris: Okay, that's him. Number six.
  Peter: Hi. Excuse me, you guys. I'm here to pick up my son, Chris
  Griffin. He's here to finger the guy who held up that convenience
  store. Maybe you've seen him. His name is Chris Griffin. I think I got
  a picture of him, somewhere. Here you go. Yeah, you can go ahead and
  hang on to that. I got a ton of them at home. In fact, I was gonna
  throw that one out anyway, 'cause Chris messed it up by writing his
  school schedule and a list of his fears all over the back of it.
  Lois: Oh! We're so proud of you, Chris, for helping to put that
  horrible man in jail.
  Peter: Jeez, you couldn't have said it was Celine Dion, huh? Our one
  chance to put that showboating Canadian wench behind bars and you blow
  it.
  Announcer: We now return to the E! True Hollywood Story. Alf.
  Alf: By the third season, I was completely wasted all the time. I had
  lost all control of my bodily functions. They had to cut the crap out
  of my fur before each taping. But would I do it all again?
  Tom Tucker: We interrupt this program for a breaking news story. We now
  go live to the Rhode Island State Penitentiary, where Asian reporter
  Tricia Takanawa is standing by. Tricia?
  Tricia Takanawa: Tom, I'm outside this maximum-security facility where
  a ruthless thug has engineered a daring escape. Sir, do you have any
  plans now that you're out of jail?
  Robber: Yeah. I'm gonna go bang my girlfriend, and then I'm gonna kill
  Chris Griffin!
  Stewie: Good lord! Can they really say "bang my girlfriend" on TV?
  Lois: You want to remove us from the area?
  FBI Agent 1: Yes, ma'am. This criminal will stop at nothing to find
  your son, so we're placing your family in the witness protection
  program.
  Stewie: Oh, Is Europe an option? I say, I've always wanted to spend a
  year in Prague teaching English. You know, slacking off a bit, but
  really getting to know myself.
  FBI Agent 1: Well, until we catch this guy, you'll be relocated to the
  deep South.
  [All moaning]
  Peter: Deep South? Isn't that where the black guys are really lazy and
  all the white guys are just as lazy but are mad at the black guys for
  being so lazy?
  FBI Agent 1: Jenkins and I have been assigned to live here and watch
  your house while you're gone. Even though he's a slovenly liberal, and
  I'm a fastidious conservative.
  FBI Agent 2: I smell a sitcom!
  FBI Agent: I suggest you start packing immediately.
  Meg: I can't believe I have to change schools because of you! This is
  all your fault, Lardo!
  Peter: Me? I had nothing to do with it.
  Meg: No. I meant Chris!
  Peter: Oh. Yeah, Lardo!
  Lois: Look, everybody. Here we are. The town of Bumblescum.
  [Instrumental Dixie music]
  Meg: This is our house?
  Lois: Oh, come on, Meg! I bet if we fixed it up a little bit, it could
  be a piece of crap.
  [Flies buzzing]
  Lois: Oh, what's that smell?
  Brian: It's either bad meat or good cheese.
  Peter: There's a penny underneath that couch.
  Meg: Somebody's in the closet!
  Jeff Foxworthy: You know you're a redneck when your gun rack has a gun
  rack on it!
  Stewie: You suck!
  Lois: Oh, my! Well, it's too hot to cook anyway. Peter, what's the
  upstairs like?
  Peter: There's a crunchberry underneath the fridge.
  Meg: Mom, Chris found a jar in the basement! And it has a hand in it!
  Chris: I'm gonna plant it and see if a human grows!
  Peter: Well, at least the TV gets decent reception. Must be some kind
  of nature show. Help! Help! Get it off! Get if off!
  Meg: Great. We're here five minutes, and Dad gets mauled by a rodent.
  Brian: This place is horrible.
  Lois: Okay. Now, everybody calm down. We don't know anything about this
  community. I bet if we explore the town, we'll each find something
  about it we like.
  Peter: You know, that's a great idea, Lois. I just got to hit the can.
  Lois: I think there's just an outhouse, Peter.
  Peter: Hey, Lois, I don't get how this works. It's just a hole. I don't
  think it goes anywhere. No, it definitely doesn't go anywhere. Oh! Oh,
  God! Oh, it's everywhere! It's in my raccoon wounds! Oh, God!
  Lois: Excuse me. Do you have an ATM?
  Redneck: Over there, ma'am.
  Redneck Banker: How much you want to take out?
  Lois: $40.
  Redneck Banker: There's a service charge of $1.50. Do y'all accept?
  Lois: Yes.
  Redneck Banker: Mmm. You smell like the inside of my mama's purse.
  Lois: Thank you.
  Musician: [Playing banjo music]
  Stewie: What are those dulcet tones? Why, this is the music of the
  angels! What is that magical device?
  Musician: Banjo. Pluck that string.
  Stewie: Oh! I feel so deliciously white trash! Mommy, I want a mullet!
  Peter: All right, that about does it. Isn't she beautiful, Brian?
  Brian: The Duke boys would be proud, Peter.
  Peter: Yeah, and you got to get in through the window, like this. Okay.
  Now you. Oh, sorry. I forgot to roll yours down. You all right? Hello?
  Wake up, sleepyhead.
  Chris: Hi.
  Sam: Hi.
  Chris: Are you mad at that pond?
  Sam: Shoot, no! 'Course, this pond did kill my grandpappy. He saw his
  reflection in the water, thought it was him and drowned trying to save
  himself.
  Chris: That's why my mom doesn't let me look in the toilet.
  Sam: I'm Sam.
  Chris: I'm Chris.
  Sam's Father: Sam, come on in, now.
  Sam: Well, I gotta go help my daddy bring in the mud harvest. Nice
  making your acquaintance, Chris.
  Chris: Oh, my God! I'm drowning!
  Radio: And that was Merle Haggard with "I Kissed My Sweetie With My
  Fist." Coming up next...
  Peter: All right. Here's one. Let's jump that. [Yelling triumphantly]
  Oh, that was great! Hey, next time let's get Meg to be Boss Hogg and
  Chris can be Anus.
  Brian: Enos.
  Peter: What'd I say?
  Brian: "Anus."
  Teacher All right, class. We have a new student joining us. Everyone
  please welcome Megan Griffin from the North.
  All: Wow!
  Student 1: What's it like up there? Y'all got them talking pictures?
  Student 2: And flying machines?
  Student 3: And perfume for your armpits?
  Meg: We sure do.
  Teacher: All right, class. That's enough questions for Megan. Time to
  hand back last week's spelling tests. And it looks like Oinky has set
  the curve again.
  Student 1: Oh, dang!
  Student 2: That is some smart pig.
  Student 3: Good thing I copied off Oinky.
  Lois: Ta da! Possum Surprise. Actually, I made it with Shake 'N Bake.
  Stewie: And I helped!
  Lois: Kids, where's your father?
  [Peter and Brian yelling triumphantly]
  Lois: Peter, what the hell are you doing?
  Peter: I'm blending in. Relax, Lois. It's not our house.
  Lois: I'm glad you're having fun, but we need some money. Have you
  thought about looking for a job?
  Peter: Yes, Lois, I have. But I've also thought about getting fired
  from that job. Is that something you really want to put our family
  through? Think about that while I get myself a drink. Oh, God!
  Sam: It's right up here past this clearing. He's been here about three
  months now.
  Chris: Wow! Where do you think you go when you die?
  Sam: I learnt at church that if you're good, you go to Heaven. But if
  you're bad, you go to a place where the dead believe they're still
  living and they pray for death, but death won't come.
  Chris: UPN?
  Sam: You're funny. I like you, Chris.
  Chris: I like you too, Sam.
  Sam: Want to poke him?
  Chris: Do I! You know, it's true. The best things in life really are
  free.
  Peter: I don't know, Brian. Maybe Lois is right. Maybe it is time for
  me to get a job.
  Brian: Yeah, too bad you always blow it in the interview.
  Employer So, Peter, where do you see yourself in five years?
  Peter: [Thinking] Don't say, "Doing your wife." Don't say, "Doing your
  wife." Don't say, "Doing your wife." [aloud] Doing your...son? Hey,
  Brian, look at that!
  Sheriff: Interested? We just take turns being the sheriff. It's real
  easy. You just hang out here, eat some pie, and get drunk.
  Peter: Wait. Hold on a second. "Pie," "drunk," "the"? You got yourself
  a sheriff!
  [as sheriff]
  Peter: [Slurring] Boy, it's so quiet around here!
  Brian: I know.
  Peter: The phone hasn't rang all day.
  Brian: I-I know. There's nothing to...[Stuttering] [Sighing] Oh, boy!
  What's the word I'm looking for? "Do"!
  Peter: Oh, Brian, you're drunk. You're drunk. Give me your keys.
  Chris: What is this, Dad?
  Peter: A Southern tradition, son. It's a reenactment of the Civil War.
  Redneck: Robert E. Lee, I knew I'd find you here where they seat the
  sorry-ass losers!
  Sam's Father: Ulysses S. Grant, you invite me to lunch then show up an
  hour late, drunk?
  Redneck: I was busy looking for your wife to give her the old...
  Sam's Father: Sir, this means war!
  Redneck: I am vanquished.
  Sam's Father: I hereby declare victory in the name of the Confederacy!
  [Crowd cheering]
  Peter: Uh, excuse me. I don't think that's how it happened. I'm pretty
  sure the North won.
  Sam's Father: What are you saying, fella?
  Peter: I'm saying that drunken idiot kicked your sorry asses south of
  the Donna Dixon line!
  Sam's Father: We don't take too kindly to that sort of talk, mister.
  And I sure as shoot don't want your kid hanging around with my kid. And
  if you think I'm mad now, you got to answer to them Civil War survivors!
  Old Redneck: Yeah. That's right.
  Brian: Wait! Look over there! It's a newly-married, interracial gay
  couple burning the American flag!
  [All gasping]
  Old Redneck: Get 'em!
  [Crowd shouting]
  Chris: I guess we can't hang out anymore.
  Sam: I guess not.
  Chris: That sucks! 'Cause I really like spending time with you.
  Sam: Me, too.
  Chris: [Muffled protests] What are you doing?
  [Instrumental Dixie music]
  Waylon Jennings: Them Griffin boys better grow some wings or start
  flapping their arms.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Old Redneck 1: Lost 'em!
  Old Redneck 2: Dag-blasted Lincoln lovers!
  Old Redneck 3: Anyone seen my foot?
  Chris: [writing in diary] "Man, was last night weird! I kissed a boy.
  But the truth is, I really like him as a friend. His name is Sam."
  Brian: You kissed Sam last night?
  Chris: How did you know?
  Brian: Well, you're saying it out loud. I could hear you in the other
  room.
  Chris: The weird thing is, kissing Sam kind of felt right. But I don't
  know if I can face him again. Brian, what should I do? I haven't been
  this confused since the end of "No Way Out"! [at movies] How does Kevin
  Costner keep getting work?
  FBI Agent 2: How do I shoot? How do I shoot?
  FBI Agent 1: Press B! B button!
  [Knocking]
  Robber: Telegram for Chris Griffin.
  FBI Agent 1: Oh, he's not here.
  Robber: Where is he?
  FBI Agent 1: I can't release that information.
  Robber: Oh, did I say Chris? I meant Chris's sister.
  FBI Agent 1: Oh, if it's for Meg, that's a whole other story. Here's
  her address. What are you doing?
  FBI Agent 2: You were busy, so I played your guy.
  FBI Agent 1: Fine, I didn't want to play anyway!
  FBI Agent 2: Well, then it worked out for everybody!
  FBI Agent 1: I'll draw boobs on the Etch-A-Sketch!
  FBI Agent 2: Go ahead, they always come out square!
  Sam: Oh, hi, Chris.
  Chris: Hey. Listen, Sam. I like hanging out with you and all. It's just
  that I don't want a romantic relationship. But I'd like it if we could
  still be friends.
  Sam: I'd like that, too. Want to go for a swim?
  Chris: Sure. You're a girl?
  Sam: Of course I am!
  Chris: Oh, my God!
  Stewie: [tuning banjo] Warm out today. Warm yesterday. Even warmer
  today.
  [Lively Dixie music]
  Stewie: ? Met her on my CB, said her name was Venie ? ? Sounded like an
  angel come to Earth ?
  Southerners: ? Come to Earth ?
  Stewie: ? When I went to meet her ? ? Man you should've seen her ? ?
  Twice as tall as me, three times the girth ?
  Southerners: ? Girth ?
  Stewie: ? Oh, my fat baby loves to eat ?
  'Southerners: ? Loves to eat ?
  Stewie: ? A big ol' Buddha belly and her breasts swing past her feet ?
  Southerners: ? Feet ?
  Stewie: ? My fat baby loves to ?
  All: ? Eat ?
  Stewie: ? My big ol' fat-ass baby loves to eat ?
  Stewie: I'VE GOT BLISTERS ON ME FINGERS!
  Peter: A drop more of the shine, my dear?
  Lois: Yes, please.
  Peter: You know, the kids are gonna be at that town social for a while.
  Lois: I think I know where you're going.
  [Both laughing]
  Peter: Ah, ah, ah! Oh, God!
  [Phone rings]
  Lois: Hello?
  FBI Agent 1: Hello, Mrs. Griffin? Yeah. Sh. Shut up. You guys, shut up.
  Yeah, hi, this is the FBI calling from your house.
  Peter: Oh, God!
  Lois: Oh, hi. How is everything?
  FBI Agent 1: Good, good. Real good. Real good. Listen, promise you
  won't be mad and it's probably nothing, but you know that criminal
  who's after your son? Yeah, he might know where you guys are.
  Lois: What? Peter, that criminal is on his way here to kill Chris!
  Lois: We gotta call the sheriff!
  Peter: Holy crap! I'm on it, Lois! "Sheriff's Office." Yes, hello. This
  is Peter Griffin. I'd like to report a dangerous criminal who may be
  coming to town. "I'm sorry, could you repeat your name?" It's Peter
  Griffin. G-R-l-F-F-l-N.
  Lois: Wait a minute. You're the sheriff?
  Peter: Hang on one sec, honey. I'm on the phone. "Who's that?" My wife.
  Lois: Chris is in danger! Do something! Round up a posse!
  Peter: Yeah, well, see, I kind of pissed off the whole town at that
  Civil War reenactment.
  Lois: What are we gonna do?
  Peter: I don't know, Lois. But I feel lower than a bow-legged
  caterpillar.
  Buck Owen: [Chuckling] Now, here's Roy!
  [Lively country music playing]
  Redneck 1: Sure is a ding-dang of a hoedown.
  Redneck 2: Uh-uh. This here's a hootenanny.
  Redneck 1: Hoedown!
  Redneck 2: Hootenanny!
  Redneck 1: Hoedown!
  Redneck 2: Hootenanny!
  Redneck 1: Hoedown!
  Redneck 2: Hootenanny!
  Stewie: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh, and to the owner
  of a John Deere tractor, you're parked on top of a pig. John Deere
  tractor on top of a pig.
  Chris: Sam, can I talk to you?
  Sam: Sure. But why aren't you looking at me?
  Chris: Well, that's the thing. I'm no good at talking to girls. That's
  why I ran away from you.
  Sam: well, you didn't have trouble talking to me when you thought I was
  a boy.
  Chris: Yeah, that's true.
  Sam: Just pretend I'm a boy.
  Chris: Okay.
  Sam: You want to go down to the old town bridge and make out?
  Chris: Yes, sir!
  Meg: And in the city, glasses are considered really sexy.
  Boy: Dang! I hope her brother don't already have dibs on her.
  Brian: Where's Chris? That criminal's here and he's after him.
  Meg: He's down by the old town bridge. You know, my brother is the one
  he's here to kill!
  Girl: My daughter would absolutely love you.
  [Sweet instrumental music]
  Sam: You're so cute. You're like a skinny Garth Brooks.
  Robber: I got you now, Griffin!
  Chris: [Exclaiming]
  Peter: Not so fast, buddy!
  Robber: Who are you?
  Peter: Oh, you can call me Officer T.J. Hooker! Sheriff Officer T.J.
  Hooker! And this is my deputy, McMillan and Wife.
  Robber: Well, I hated T.J. Hooker! And I never actually saw McMillan
  and Wife! Although I was aware of it! Anyway, you're dead!
  Robber: You're mine now, fella!
  Chris: [Screaming] Dad! Help! Help! Dad!
  Sam's Father: You folks all right?
  Peter: Wow! You guys saved our lives. After I said that all Southern
  people have bad teeth and suffer from the gum disease known as
  gingivitis.
  Sam's Father: Well, we take care of our own. And as long as y'all live
  here, y'all are Southerners, too.
  Peter: Wow, thanks!
  Sam's Father: It's our pleasure. Sam, I'll see you at home.
  Peter: I think the lesson here is it doesn't matter where you're from,
  as long as we're all the same religion.
  Teacher: It was great having you in class, Meg.
  Meg: Thanks. I'm really gonna miss everybody.
  Student 1: We didn't have no money for a present. So, we all just spit
  in a jar.
  Sam: I can't believe you're leaving.
  Chris: Me, either. I'll be sure to write.
  Sam: And I'll be sure to learn to read.
  Chris: And the next time I see a dead guy I'm gonna poke him twice as
  hard for both of us.
  [Sentimental instrumental country music]
  Lois: It's so nice to be home.
  Answering Machine: You have 113 new messages.
  Lois: Oh, my!
  Herbert: Uh, yeah, I was just wondering where the newspaper boy was.
  [Machine beeps]
  Herbert: Haven't seen a newspaper in a couple days. Wonderin' if he
  ever gonna come back.
  [Machine beeps]
  Herbert: Guess who? Sorry to leave you so many messages. Just Ionely
  here. Thinkin' about the muscly-armed paperboy. Wishin' he'd come by
  and bring me some good news.
  [Machine beeps]
  Herbert: Where are you?
  [Machine beeps]
  Herbert: You're starting to piss me off, you little piggly son of a
  bitch. Call me.
  [closing theme music]



Title: Screwed the Pooch

Lois: Okay. I got the whole day planned. First, we see the primates.
  Then the butterfly house. Then a bathroom break. Then we'll...
  Peter: Come on, Lois. Can't we all run around in a disorganized fashion?
  Meg: Yeah!
  Stewie: Let it go, Lois!
  Chris: Monkeys throw their poop!
  Lois: No. If we don't adhere to a strict schedule, we won't see
  everything.
  Peter: Kids, gas masks. Run!
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Stewie: There you are. Oh, don't be such a pig, Mr. Pig. Now, where's
  Mr. Sheep? Is he being baaa-shful? [Laughing] That's right. You're all
  ripe for parody.
  Brian: Can we go now?
  Stewie: Shut up! I'm having fun. Oh, my! Someone's awfully rude. My
  fanny is not on the menu! What? Oh! Oh, God!
  Peter: Here, little fella. Come get the food. I have always wanted to
  do this.
  Lois: Oh, here are the marsupials. Peter, what the hell are you doing?
  Peter: Look at me, Lois. I'm Roo! Come on, Ma. Let's go watch Pooh
  trick the bees out of their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.
  Stewie: I am going to kick your ass.
  Theme Song
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Brian: How's it going?
  Man: Great. Beautiful day.
  Brian: Oh, gorgeous. You know, we sit here and force small talk while
  they have the time of their lives.
  Man Yeah. Yeah.
  Brian: [Whistles] Here, girl. [Shuddering] Sorry. I thought I
  smelled...cookies.
  Mort Goldman: Wow! Does it really smell like...oh, God! She farted, and
  it went down my throat!
  Peter: Full house.
  Cleveland: Dagnab! That's some poker face you've got, Peter.
  Peter: Years of practice, boys.
  Joe: Peter, you're on a roll. We ought to get you down to Atlantic City
  this weekend.
  Peter: Sorry, guys. Lois is making me visit the in-laws this weekend. I
  don't know why she even bothers. Me and Lois's old man have never
  gotten along.
  [Peter at computer]
  Peter: Hey, I got an e-mail from Mr. Pewterschmidt!
  Joe: You should find some common ground with your father-in-law, Peter.
  Figure out what he likes, and study up on it.
  Peter: Hey, that's a great idea. I'll learn how to act like a rich guy.
  I'm gonna start right now. Cratchit, you're working through Christmas!
  Bob Cratchit: But, sir, what of Tiny Tim?
  Peter: Bah! He and his ukulele shall go wanting.
  [Peter at newsstand]
  Peter: Huh-The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this. "I'd be more
  apathetic if I weren't so lethargic." [Crickets chirping] [crickets
  chirping] Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny. Yeah. Can I have a copy
  of Jugs?
  [Peter at adult education class]
  Teacher: In French, when you want to say "yes," you say "oui, oui."
  Peter: You gotta be kidding me! Oh, my God! That is hysterical! Oh,
  man! And what do you say for no? "Doo-doo"? Hey, I'll be right back. I
  gotta go take a wicked "yes."
  [Regal instrumental music]
  Crowd: [Exclaiming with comprehension]
  Guy: It's a person.
  Lois: Peter, would you please fix the bathroom faucet?
  Peter: I fixed it already.
  Lois: No, you didn't. It's still dripping.
  Peter: No way! I will give you all my Star Wars cards if it is. Wait,
  wait. Except Boba Fett. No matter how sure I am, I never risk the Fett
  man.
  Lois: Oh, my God! [Gasping] Was he just mastur...
  Peter: Yes.
  Lois: Oh, my!
  Peter: Do we-do we rub his nose in it?
  Lois: Oh, hi, Brian.
  Brian: Uh, listen, Lois, about yesterday...
  Lois: Oh, Brian. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's perfectly
  normal.
  Brian: I know. It's just, you know, I should be able to control my
  baser instincts. But lately I've just been having these urges.
  Lois: Brian, why don't you come up to my parents' house with us? The
  fresh air will help you relax.
  Stewie: I know where I go when I want to relax. [Stewie at gay dance
  club] I know the guy that owns this place!
  Man: What?
  Stewie: I said, I know the guy that...I'll tell you later. I love this
  song.
  [Dance music playing]
  Brian: Thanks. But I think a quiet weekend here by myself is just the
  thing I need.
  Lois: well, have a good time.
  Brian: All right, I'm just gonna relax, mellow out, and watch some
  television.
  Announcer: We now return to "World's Sluttiest Dogs" on Fox.
  Brian: Hey, wait up!
  Peter: [laughs] Right into the bumper.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Lois: Hi, Mom.
  Barbara: Oh, look at you all. I know someone who's getting a gift
  certificate for liposuction in her stocking.
  Meg: Thank you, Nana.
  Carter: Hello, everyone.
  Lois: Hi, Daddy.
  Peter: Bonjour, Monsieur Pewterschmidt.
  Carter: Did Peter have a stroke?
  Lois: No, Daddy. Peter's cultured himself, like Julia Roberts in Pretty
  Woman.
  Carter: Oh, so I should treat him like a high-class whore.
  Peter: That's fine. Just no kissing on the lips.
  Barbara: Would you like a piece of candy?
  Stewie: I smell death on you!
  Peter: Ahoy, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Permission to come aboard?
  Carter: No!
  Peter: Thanks. Quite a schooner you got here. What is she, like, a
  45-footer?
  Carter: Peter, I didn't know you were a sailor.
  Peter: I didn't know you looked so good in shorts. [Whistling and
  purring]
  Carter: What?
  Peter: You don't have an eye spliced in this mooring line. I'll tie a
  bowline in there and make one for you. That should hold her.
  Sommelier: And this is a '74 Pinot Noir.
  Man 1: Lovely.
  Man 2: Carter, did you tell your son-in-law he's not supposed to
  swallow the wine?
  Peter: [Slurring] Where the hell is that Peter Griffin? He said he'd
  give me $100 if I took off all my clothes off.
  Carter: [Growling]
  Brian: Thanks for bringing me here, Lois. This is just what I needed.
  Lois: I'm glad. It seems like everybody's having a lot of fun.
  Masseuse: So, how long are you and your family in town?
  Stewie: No conversation.
  Carter: You idiot! I'm never taking you to my country club again!
  Peter: Look, I'm sorry, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
  Carter: Your husband is a moron! He walks up to the premier of China
  and says, "Dong, where is my automobile?"
  Peter: Lois, I tried to fit in with your dad's crowd, but it's worse
  than before. I tell ya, this sucks worse than that time I was on
  Survivor.
  [on "Survivor"]
  Peter: How dare you wash your clothes in our drinking water, Bebe? Now
  how are we gonna survive in this harsh, unforgiving terrain?
  Bob Barker: All right, Donny, make sure the wheel goes all the way
  around.
  Peter: [Fakes being afraid] Oh, no. Headhunters. Am I fired?
  Lois: Daddy, Peter's been trying really hard to get you to like him.
  Couldn't you give him another chance? Let him join your poker game
  tomorrow night?
  Carter: Sorry, honey. I'd rather be stuck in an elevator with Nathan
  Lane, Gilbert Gottfried, Carrot Top, uh, Sean Hayes.... well, you get
  the picture.
  Lois: Please?
  Carter: No!
  Lois: Okay. You know, maybe later I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place
  and introduce her to that nice mulatto boy who looks an awful lot
  like...
  Carter: Say, would Peter like to play poker with us?
  Lois: He'd love to, Daddy.
  Carter: That sounds dynamite.
  [Cheery instrumental music]
  Carter: Brian, come over here and meet Seabreeze, my prize-winning dog.
  Isn't she a perfect specimen? I mean, look at these legs, and that
  beautiful coat, and feel the heat coming off of her genitalia. You
  could roast a marshmallow. That's how you can tell she's a champion. Go
  on, put your hand there.
  Brian: Oh, boy. That is something.
  Carter: Is that something?
  Brian: That is something. That is hot.
  Carter: Isn't she the most beautiful dog you've ever seen?
  Brian: Yes, yes, she is a beautiful dog. And that's okay.
  Carter: Gentlemen, this is Peter. He's the idiot my daughter married.
  Michael Eisner: Michael Eisner.
  Bill Gates: Bill Gates.
  Carter: Bill, Peter's an antitrust lawyer with the Justice Department.
  Just kidding. He's a fisherman, or some stupid thing.
  Ted Turner: Hey, fellas.
  Peter: Wow! Ted Turner!
  Carter: I told you guys not to invite him.
  Michael Eisner: He must have followed us.
  Ted Turner: Come on, ladies. Are we gonna play cards or what?
  Carter: Peter, why don't you deal?
  Peter: Okay, guys. We're playing Texas Hold 'Em.
  Ted Turner: Are aces high or low?
  Peter: They go both ways.
  Bill Gates: He said, "They go both ways."
  [All laughing]
  Ted Turner: Like a bisexual.
  Michael Eisner: Thank you, Ted. That was the joke.
  Ted Turner: I see your bet, Carter. And I raise you CNN.
  Carter: I don't think I can...
  Peter: Wait, wait, wait. You can beat him, Mr. Pewterschmidt. He's
  bluffing.
  Carter: Peter, he just bet CNN. There's no way he's bluffing.
  Peter: I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. Listen, if you lose this hand,
  I'll divorce your daughter.
  Carter: I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN with US Steel. What
  do you got?
  Ted Turner: Two pair.
  Carter: Ace-high straight.
  Ted Turner: You sold me out. I could use a man like you. How's $1
  million a year sound? You disgust me! Get out of my face!
  Carter: Peter, that's the first time any of us have ever beaten Ted.
  Bill Gates: Yeah. How did you know he was bluffing?
  Peter: Well, when he lies, he blinks twice. I first noticed it when he
  did that Barbara Walters interview, and he said he'd be with Jane Fonda
  forever.
  Bill Gates: Well, I'm gonna turn in.
  Michael Eisner: Yeah. Me, too. I gotta be at Disneyland before it
  opens. We're ethnically cleansing the "Small World" ride.
  Peter: Come on. You guys practically run this country. There's gotta be
  a ton of fun stuff we could do.
  Bill Gates: All right!
  Peter: Oh, man! There's a tollbooth. Hey, anybody got a quarter?
  Bill Gates: What's a quarter?
  Peter: Well, we gotta give him something.
  [All laughing]
  Peter: Man, looking up at the sky just makes you feel so small.
  Bill Gates: Yeah. I mean, if God created all this, who created God?
  Michael Eisner: Maybe he created himself.
  Peter: Or herself. Think about that.
  Bill Gates: Neat. This guy's deep, Carter. Where'd you find him?
  Carter: He's my son-in-law.
  [Cell phone rings]
  Bill Gates: Okay, honey. I gotta go, you want a ride?
  Michael Eisner: Sure.
  Peter: Wow!
  Carter: Peter, I actually had a good time with you tonight. And I just
  want to say-well-I'm glad you married my daughter.
  Peter: Thank you, Jesus.
  Jesus: Actually, it wasn't me. It was...
  Vishnu: No, no. It's okay. I'm used to it.
  Carter: Having fun, Peter?
  Peter: You bet. I put all my poker winnings on your dog, Mr. P.
  Brian: Dog?
  Carter: You got nothing to worry about. Seabreeze is a sure thing.
  Brian: Seabreeze?
  Chris: Dad, where are the jockeys?
  Peter: They're all in the laundry, son. I'm going Indian today.
  Lois: Come on, Seabreeze!
  Peter: Yeah! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Go!
  Brian: [shuddering]
  Lois: What's Brian doing?
  Meg: Oh, my God!
  Carter: He's violating Seabreeze!
  Peter: No, no, he's just awkwardly positioning himself-now he's
  violating Seabreeze.
  Stewie: [Making funky porn-style music]
  Brian: Mr. Pewterschmidt, again, I just want to tell you how sorry I am
  about this. I don't know what came over me.
  Carter: You had better not have ruined my race dog!
  Peter: Brian, I am very disappointed in you! I'd turn my back on you,
  but I've seen what you do in that situation. Now, if you'll excuse me,
  Carter and I have a polio match to attend.
  Carter: Get away from me! You and that filthy mongrel of yours! How is
  she, Doctor?
  Veternarian: She's fine. Seabreeze will be able to race again. But,
  unfortunately, not for another nine weeks. She's pregnant.
  Brian: Look, Mr. Pewterschmidt, I just want you to know, I am going to
  do the right thing here.
  Carter: You're not doing anything! In fact, you're never going to see
  Seabreeze again! All of you, pack your things and get out!
  Peter:I am never speaking to you again. Don't worry, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
  I have a plan. I am gonna go back in time and stop Brian from getting
  it on with your dog. Everybody stand back. [wailing] Oh, boy. Oh, God.
  Ah.
  [front door]
  Peter: Mr. Pewterschmidt, please? Can we still be pals? See, look. I
  made a picture of you and me out of glue and macaroni.
  Carter: Wow, Peter! That means a lot to me because you made it.
  Peter: Really?
  Carter: No! Get out of here!
  Veternarian: Mr. Pewterschmidt! Seabreeze is gone!
  Carter: What?
  Lois: I can't find Brian.
  Carter: Peter, you know what I'm going to do to you if Brian took off
  with my Seabreeze?
  Peter: I think I have an idea. [sobbing]
  Man: This is the room. The light switch is here. It's mostly for show.
  There's your Murphy bed. Don't mind the Epsteins. They keep to
  themselves.
  Mrs. Epstein: We're going to see Bobby Darin at the Copa tomorrow,
  right, Charlie?
  Mr. Epstein: Bobby Darin tomorrow.
  Man: This is the bathroom. But watch out. We got some bad roaches here.
  Roach 1: You're on our turf, man!
  Roach 2: Man, I cut you! I cut you up so bad, you gonna wish I no cut
  you up so bad.
  Brian: Those are bad roaches.
  Man: I blame the schools.
  [Mysterious instrumental music]
  Brian: Were you followed?
  Lois: Don't worry. I've got a decoy.
  Quagmire: Hi, Lois. Hubba-hubba. Whoa, Lois! You put on a few, huh?
  Chris: Well, I never!
  Stewie: That's all right, honey. I don't think he was the one anyway.
  Now, let's go get sundaes.
  Lois: You know, we all really miss you. And Peter talks about you all
  the time.
  Brian: Oh, really? Anything nice?
  Lois: No.
  Brian: So, he's still mad, huh?
  Lois: Well, I should go. Here. Take this. It's probably not a good idea
  for us to meet anymore. Daddy swore he'd track you down any way he
  could.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Michael Eisner: Bingo!
  Bill Gates: I told you she'd lead us to him. Let's call Pewterschmidt.
  Michael Eisner: No, wait. Let's take the jetpacks!
  Bill Gates: Cool!
  Michael Eisner: Man! The people look like ants from up here.
  Bill Gates: They are ants, Michael. They are ants.
  Tricia Takanawa: This is Tricia Takanawa reporting live, where police
  have discovered the whereabouts of Seabreeze, the heiress to the
  Pewterschmidt fortune. The dognapper has been traced to this sleazy
  motel. Ah, I see my colleague Tom Tucker is already on the scene.
  Prostitute: Who's that, baby?
  Tom Tucker: Hello, this is Tom Tucker's...evil twin, Todd Tucker out to
  destroy his brother's reputation. [fake evil laugh] I'm going back
  inside to have freaky sex with my prostitute with whom I still have 45
  minutes. Now, back to this breaking news.
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Lois: Brian, please, eat something.
  Brian: Why bother? My face is plastered all over the news. Your father
  won't let me see the dog who's carrying my puppies. And my best friend
  is going to incredible lengths to ignore me.
  Lois: Brian, don't let him get to you. Peter, come out of that thing!
  Brian: He can't hear you, Lois. Besides, it's not him that's getting to
  me, it's your father.
  Lois: I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he wouldn't budge. He can be so
  stubborn. I don't know how my mother puts up with it. He did promise to
  take good care of the puppies though.
  Brian: Well, you know, they're not his to take care of. They're my
  kids! And I'm gonna get them back. My father wasn't there for me, but
  dammit I'm gonna be there for my kids! I'm gonna sue your dad for
  custody!
  [Solemn instrumental music]
  Lois: Daddy, please, stop this. Brian has every right to see his
  puppies when they're born.
  Carter: Sorry, pumpkin.
  Lois: I had no idea you could be so cruel. I'll never forgive you for
  this!
  Carter: Oh, you'll be fine. You're just having your period.
  Judge: This court will now come to order.
  Lawyer: Brian, do you like children?
  Brian: I love children. That's why I'm here. I want the opportunity to
  raise my puppies.
  Lawyer: Do you remember an incident at a South Attleboro Denny's in
  December of 1996?
  Brian: Yeah, I guess.
  Baby [Baby screaming]
  Brian: [screaming back] You like that? You like that? [Screaming] You
  just tune this out, don't you? Well, tune this out! [Screaming]
  [Both scream]
  Brian: Shut up! <back in court> Look, I was angry because
  my Moon Over Mi-hammy was overcooked...
  Lawyer: I also have your rental records from the Quahog Video Store.
  Can you read the last two titles, please?
  Brian: Son-In-Law and Bio-dome.
  Lawyer: And who's the star of those films?
  Brian: Pauly Shore.
  Lawyer: Pauly Shore!
  Man: He's terrible!
  Brian: But I rented those for Peter. He got banned from the video store
  for taping over their movies.
  [Mysterious music on TV]
  Charles Foster Kane: Rosebud.
  [Dramatic music on TV]
  Peter: It's his sled. It was his sled from when he was a kid. There. I
  just saved you two long, boobless hours.
  Lawyer: How convenient! Blame it on someone else. Is that the kind of
  man we want raising these puppies?
  Brian: Peter? You got to believe me, Your Honor.
  Carter: Uh, Peter, I'm putting together another card game. You in?
  Peter: You want me to play?
  Carter: Absolutely. But first I want you to testify against that horny
  mutt of yours.
  Peter: I don't know if I can do that.
  Carter: Ooh, that's too bad. Because Bill and Michael really want to
  see you again. They're coming over later, and Bill's going to bring his
  Stretch Armstrong.
  Peter: Oh, man! And his arms stretch out to next week!
  Carter: Your Honor, Peter Griffin would like to take the stand.
  Lawyer: Mr. Griffin, which of the following two phrases best describes
  Brian Griffin? "Problem drinker" or "African-American haberdasher"?
  Peter: I guess "problem drinker." But that's...
  Lawyer: Thank you. "Sexual deviant" or "magic picture that you stare at
  till you see something"?
  Peter: "Sexual deviant," but that other one's...
  Lawyer: Thank you. Isn't it true that you told my client, Carter
  Pewterschmidt, that Brian is a menace to society and should never be
  allowed to see his children?
  [All gasping]
  [Suspenseful instrumental music]
  Peter: Brian should be allowed to see his puppies!
  Carter: Peter, think about what you're doing.
  Peter: I am. Your Honor, Brian'll be a great dad. Hell, if I was half
  the parent Brian is, I'd know that Chris's favorite ice cream is...
  Brian: Chocolate-chip.
  Peter: And Stewie's favorite bedtime story is...
  Brian: Goodnight, Moon.
  Peter: And Meg's real father's name is...
  Brian: Stan Thompson.
  Meg: [Pop music on headphones]
  Judge: I've heard enough. I do believe that Brian would be a successful
  parent. However, if he was to repeat his actions at the dog track he
  would be setting a bad example for his puppies. Therefore, I grant
  Brian custody with the condition that he be neutered first.
  Peter: Yeah! You did it, buddy! Congratulations! Oh, man! What does
  "neutered" mean?
  Brian: You're almost there, Seabreeze. Oh, and, also, I didn't bring
  this up before, but promise me you won't eat any of them.
  Carter: You know, Brian, it occurs to me that this is like a Greek
  tragedy where a man must choose between himself and his children. Of
  course, you'll be playing the role of "Sans Testaclese."
  Veternarian: We're ready for you, down the hall.
  Peter: Are you sure you want to go through with this, Brian? Because
  you could have puppies with another dog. Oh, maybe with a condor! Then
  you'd have flying puppies. Would you like that, Brian? Flying puppies?
  Brian: No, Peter. Those puppies in there are mine. And I'll give
  anything to be with them. Anything.
  Peter: I am not looking forward to what you'll be like once they do
  this to you.
  Brian: I love chocolate! But I can't eat it, because then I'll get fat.
  But it's so good!
  Veternarian: Are you ready, Brian?
  Brian: I guess so.
  Lois: Stop! Brian, come quick!
  Brian: Oh, my God! Those aren't my puppies!
  Peter: Well, then whose are they?
  [All barking]
  Carter: You! You're a whore! A filthy, filthy whore!
  Lois: You must be so relieved.
  Brian: Well, actually, I was kind of looking forward to being a dad.
  Peter: Don't worry. There'll be other chances.
  Peter: You know what's funny? I always thought that dogs laid eggs. And
  I learned something today.

Title: Peter Griffin Husband Father Brother

Dennis Miller: I don't want to go on a rant here but America's foreign
  policy makes about as much sense as Beowulf having sex with Robert
  Fulton at the first Battle of Antietam. I mean, when a neo-conservative
  defenestrates it's like Raskolnikov filibuster deoxymonohydroxinate.
  Peter: What the hell does "rant" mean?
  Theme Song
  Lois: Go, Dust Mites!
  Peter: I wish they'd put Chris in already.
  Lois: Peter, relax. It's his first game.
  [Whistle]
  Coach: Griffin, get in there!
  Lois: They're sending him in. Yay, Chris!
  Peter: Atta boy, Chris! Hey, that's my son out there. I taught him how
  to wipe.
  Jake Tucker: Why won't you teach me how to wipe, Dad?
  Tom Tucker: Because you don't have a bottom, son.
  Boy: You and that towel are representin'.
  Chris: Yo, that sweat's just frightened, G!
  Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, the Buddy Cianci Junior High
  cheerleaders.
  Cindi: Is everybody pumped up? Gimme a D-U-S-T!
  Crowd: D-U-S-T
  Cindi: M-I-T-E-S!
  Stewie: M-I-T-E-S!
  Cindi: What does that spell?
  Stewie: Dust Mites!
  Cindi: Who's gonna win this game?
  Stewie: Dust Mites! My God, what-what just happened to me? It's those
  sirens. They have us all under their spell, like that hypnotist at the
  Airport Hilton.
  Hypnotist: ...and three!
  Brian: Oh, wow! Were we just hypnotized?
  Stewie: Well, that's incredible. I don't remember a thing. Why do I
  taste crotch?
  [back at game]
  Stewie: I must unlock the secret to their mind-control powers.
  Peter: Lois, can we go now? I'm starving.
  Lois: The game's almost over, Peter. Try to think about something else.
  [Crowd cheering]
  [Sexy instrumental music]
  Lois: Peter!
  Peter: Oh, sorry. Nice job out there tonight, Chris. You wiped the
  floor with that towel.
  Chris: Yo! Did y'all check me when that hottie was all up in my
  Kool-Aid? Yeah, I was lookin' to break off a little somethin'-somethin'
  but my crew gave me the 411 on that skank and she's all about the
  bling-bling.
  Lois: What's wrong?
  Peter: He's speaking in tongues, Lois! Our son is possessed! Meg, start
  at Psalm 41 and don't stop reading until I tell you! The power of
  Christ compels you!
  Chris: [screams]
  Peter: The power of Christ compels you!
  Lois: Peter, stop! He's not possessed.
  Meg: Yeah, he's just talking street. Lots of kids do it.
  Peter: Oh. Well, that's kind of weird.
  Lois: Peter, it's just a phase. You've gone through a few yourself.
  Brian: Like those two weeks you spent narrating your own life.
  Peter: I walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table. I looked
  with a grimace at the questionable meal Lois had placed in front of me.
  Of course, I'd never tell her how disgusted I was with her cooking, but
  somehow I think she knew. Lois had always been full of energy and life
  but lately I had begun to grow more aware of her aging. The bright,
  exuberant eyes that I had fallen in love with were now beginning to
  grow dull and listless with the long fatigue of a weary life. I awoke
  several hours later in a daze.
  [Rap music playing]
  Rapper: ? I was brought up on the streets, no moms and dads ? ? I had
  to fend for myself with my own two hands ? ? But today I'm hurtin' and
  I'll tell you why ? ? I got a hangnail ?
  Backup rappers: Hangnail!
  Rapper: ? Hanging from my cuticle ? ? A hangnail ?
  Backup rappers: Hangnail!
  Rapper: ? It ain't beautiful ? ? It hurts like a bitch that I did last
  night ?
  Peter: Hey, Chris. Whatcha doin'?
  Chris: Just laying back in the cot peepin' at this here homey. Yo,
  Pops! Let me have some cheddar. Some player-hater be throwin' salt in
  my game grillin' me over my gear. And I needs to be mackin' style!
  Peter: Well, uh, the important thing is you tried, son.
  Stewie: There they are. Very well. And now to infiltrate this coven and
  learn their mind-control secrets. Just need to get their attention.
  Cindi: Okay. That was much better. But it still sucked worse than
  anything I've ever seen! What's wrong with you guys?
  [Disco music]
  Cheerleader 1: Look how cute he is!
  Cheerleader 2: He must be a teacher's baby.
  Cheerleader 1:: He wants to be a cheerleader, too.
  Stewie: My, so it's that easy to win you over! Consider yourselves
  lucky I'm not after your gully holes.
  Peter: Then Chris starts in with all this "yo, yo, yo" stuff and I
  don't know what he's talkin' about. So I started beating him with a
  hose, then my arm got tired, so I came here.
  Brian: Peter, perhaps Chris has adopted another culture's mannerisms
  because he doesn't know enough about his own.
  Peter: Aw, gee, I never thought of that. You know, I should teach Chris
  about his Irish roots. Besides, we haven't spent any time together
  since we played Operation.
  Chris: I'm going for the "funny bone," Dad.
  Peter: Oh, you touched the sides. Oh, jeez, He's waking up. Let's get
  him back to the bus station.
  Chris: Dad, I don't want to be here. I want to be chillin' with my
  homeys.
  Peter: Now, Chris, it's important you learn about your Irish heritage.
  Animatronic Irish woman 1: [Mechanized nonsensical speech]
  Animatronic Irish woman 2: [Mechanized nonsensical speech]
  Animatronic Irish baby: [crying]
  Speaker: Ancient archeological evidence indicates that Ireland was a
  much different place before the discovery of alcohol. Most experts
  believe it was something like this.
  [flying cars whizzing]
  Irishman 1: Gentlemen, today, we, Ireland's top scientists, have found
  a way to convert our entire population to pure energy!
  Irishman 2: It's a glorious day.
  Irishman 3: Hey! Michael McCloud's just invented a new kind of beverage
  in his basement.
  Irishman 1: Hmmm, whiskey.
  [Rowdy drunken yelling]
  Chris: You were right, Dad. Being Irish rocks!
  Peter: That's more like it, son. Now, today we're gonna learn about the
  Griffin family history.
  Chris: What's a library, Dad?
  Peter: Oh, it's just a place where homeless people come to shave and go
  BM. Let's go inside.
  Chris: Look, Dad! I found this book on our genealogy!
  Peter: Way to go, son! Hey, look. Here's a picture of your
  great-great-granddad, Osias Griffin. He owned one of the first dozen
  telephones.
  Osias Griffin: Hello?
  Caller: Hello, Jonathan?
  Osias Griffin: No, what number are you calling?
  Caller: Seven.
  Osias Griffin: No. This is three.
  Caller: Ooh, sorry.
  Peter: And his great-grandpa was Thomas Griffin, a great philosopher.
  Wife: Thomas, would you please go look for a job?
  Thomas Griffin: Why?
  Chris: Wow, that's cool! Go back even further, Dad.
  Peter: Okay. Settle down, spaz. In 1840, Nathaniel "Nate" Griffin used
  to groom horses. What the hell? Holy crap! I'm black!
<back at Griffin house>
Peter: But I can't be black.
Lois: I gotta say, Peter, the man in this book does look an awful lot
  like you.
  Brian: <reading aloud> "The diary of Nate Griffin." "May
  7, 1836. I was brushing down Lucy, the new colt, when she let out a
  fart right near my face. So I took her head and stuck it by my butt and
  blew a huge fart right back at her."
  Peter: [Laughs]
  Brian: Ooh, that laugh's in here, too. See? [imitates Peter's laugh]
  Peter: Wow. Then it's true.
  Chris: Cool! I get to be black and Irish!
  Meg: Yeah, and now I can wear clothes that actually show off my big
  butt!
  Lois: Oh! I gotta tell Bonnie I'm sleeping with a black man!
  Cheerleader: Oh, my God! Update! Exclam! Scott Martin just asked me out
  again!
  Cheerleader 2: Oh, my God! This is date number three. Are you gonna let
  him get to second base?
  Stewie: I think that would be a bad idea, and I know something about
  bad ideas.
<Stewie in bar with OJ Simpson>
Stewie: I'm telling you, Juice. She's screwing around behind your back.
  And, if I were in your Bruno Maglis, I wouldn't stand for it. Another
  mai tai? Thanks. So, listen...
  Cheerleader 2: Here comes Scott!
  Stewie: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
  All: [giggling]
  Stewie: I have yet to discover the secret of their mind-control powers.
  Also, trying to comprehend their obsession with the homosexuals from
  'NSYNC.
  Peter: Hey, Cleveland, you got a minute? I really need to talk to you.
  Cleveland: Sure. I was just going for a ride. Hop on.
  Peter: So, I found out I have a black ancestor.
  Cleveland: Is that right? Well, that's fantastic, Peter.
  Peter: Yeah, but see, the problem is I got no idea how to be
  black...except for not smiling when I get my picture taken.
  Cleveland: Well, Peter. It sounds like you should go out and mingle
  amongst your newly-found brethren. You know, absorb the culture.
  Wheelie time!
  [Exuberant yelling]
  Peter: You know, you're right, Cleveland. I should be hanging around
  more black people like myself. Thanks.
  Cleveland: Hey! Peter, what the...
  Peter: It's the vibration.
  Black Comedian: Who here used to wear a lot of Jheri Curl? Yeah, that's
  right. Y'all know that Exxon Valdez thing? That ain't how it happened.
  Some brother just fell in the ocean.
  Peter: God! I remember that. And all those seals died. It was all over
  the news. The Channel 2 news with Dan Rather. Although, I think Connie
  Chung might have been substituting for him. Well, 'bout time for me to
  be hitting the ol' dusty trail. I like your hat. Can't get out that
  way. [Alarm rings] Found the emergency exit.
  Professor: 1967 was the same year that Thurgood Marshall was named to
  the Supreme Court of the United States.
  Peter: [Whooping] Well, I should probably be saddling up now. [Alarm
  rings] Oh, found the fire door.
  Stewie: Look at how fat you are. You disgust me! Oink oink, fatty! Oh,
  yes, yes, you'll take butter on that English muffin, won't you? Because
  you're the cheerleading squad's token blimp. You don't deserve to eat.
  [Vomits]
  Peter: Hey, thanks for bringing me here, Cleveland.
  Man: Welcome. For our first order of business I believe brother
  Cleveland has an announcement.
  Cleveland: Yesterday, I received reparations from the family that
  enslaved my ancestors.
  Crowd: Amen! Right on!
  Cleveland: Now, the family has become poor white trash since then. So
  they only gave what they could-this tray of scrumptious Rice Krispie
  Treats. I share them with all of you in the hopes that one day your
  wounds may be healed as well.
  Crowd: Amen. Right on.
  Man: Why is he taking one?
  Cleveland: Oh, this is my friend, Peter Griffin. He recently discovered
  he was black.
  Man 2: He doesn't look very black to me.
  Peter: Gentlemen, please, please. Judge me not by the color of my skin.
  For I have always been there with you. I was there when George and
  Weezy moved on up to the East Side. Oh, hallelujah! Those were happy
  times! But, I was also there for the bad times. When Florida lost James
  to that tragic auto accident. And I was there when Tootie got those
  terribly painful braces! Oh, yes! And when Arnold Jackson got beat up
  by the Gooch, I was there. So before you decide that I don't belong
  here, remember this-I was there!
  [Crowd cheering]
  Cosby Kid: Way to go, Peter! You tell it like it is!
  Carter: Now, Chris, this one's for you. What's the secret to happiness?
  Chris: Money!
  Carter: Very good. Babs, give him a caramel.
  Peter: Hey hey hey. Hey, Lois, what are your parents doing here?
  Lois: Oh, they surprised us with a visit after I told them about your
  recent discovery.
  Barbara: Yes. Peter, we hear you're a Negro now.
  Peter: Yep. I even got my own posse. Hey, Big Dog, T-Bone, Shades, you
  guys go make yourself some sandwiches. We'll hook up later.
  Carter: My jacket's in the kitchen; please don't write on it. Well, I
  think Chris and Meg should know the Pewterschmidt side of their
  ancestry, too. Kids, did you know the Pewterschmidts were among the
  first to colonize America?
  Peter: Now, kids, don't be taken in by The Man. Stay black and proud.
  Carter: Here's your ancestor Silas Pewterschmidt bartering with some
  local Indians.
  Chris: Cool.
  Carter: And here's a picture of...oh, never mind that one.
  Peter: Wait. What was that?
  Carter: Oh, that was nothing. Just some fellow we fed and took care of
  in exchange for doing a few chores.
  Peter: You mean a slave! Let me see that! Oh, my God! It's Nate Griffin!
  Carter: Well, 'bout time for me to be hitting the ol' dusty trail.
  Peter: Lois, your family owned my family!
  Lois: Daddy, is that true?
  Carter: Well, it appears so. Boy, this is pretty embarrassing!
  Peter: Yes, it is! And don't call me boy!
  Barbara: Peter, please calm down.
  Carter: Babs, I think it's time we went to bed. Things will look better
  in the morning. Come here, kids. Give Grandma and Grandpa a kiss
  goodnight.
  Peter: You can whip me all you like, white devil, but you'll never
  break my spirit!
  [Suspenseful music]
  Stewie: Damn! There must be some clue to the source of their
  mental-manipulation techniques. <reading aloud> "Your
  Body and You." "Every four weeks for three to four days it's entirely
  normal for every young woman to..." Oh, my God! That's the most
  disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life! Ugh!
  Cindi: That totally sucked. You guys call yourselves cheerleaders?
  Well, I call you cheer-losers!
  Stewie: This Cindi is definitely the alpha of the group.
  Cindi: And what happened with the pyramid? I almost broke my neck!
  Stewie: The pyramid! Of course! That must be the key to their power!
  Mission objective: Eliminate Cindi and take her place at the top of the
  pyramid. They're getting nude. No, I mustn't watch. It's not the proper
  thing to...I say! Nice ones, Jeanine. And look at Lisa in all of her
  curvaceous glory. Heavens, it appears my wee-wee has been stricken with
  rigor mortis.
  Peter: Good morning.
  Lois: Peter, what on earth are you wearing?
  Peter: It's a dashiki. And don't call me Peter. That's my slave name.
  From now on, call me Kichwa Tembo.
  Chris: Cool. And I'll be Mambutu O'Malley!
  Carter: Peter...
  Peter: Kichwa!
  Carter: I'd like to have a word with you. Peter, I think...
  Peter: Kichwa!
  Carter: Kichwa, we're both sensible men. There must be something I can
  do to make things right with you.
  Peter: Actually, there is. I want reparations just like Cleveland got.
  Carter: What the hell are you talking about?
  Peter: I want an apology and some Rice Krispie Treats.
  Carter: Well, I absolutely will not give you an apology and I'm
  assuming "Rice Krispie Treats" is black slang for money. So, here's
  $10,000. I expect you never to mention this ugly business again.
  Peter: $10,000?
  Carter: Not enough? Fine. Make it $20,000. How do you spell Kichwa?
  Peter: Yeah, you know what? Screw the Kichwa. Make it out to Peter.
  P-E-T-E...
  Tom Tucker: This just in. Slave-owner descendent, Carter Pewterschmidt
  has paid $20,000-or 2,000,000 pennies-in reparations to a local black
  man. We now go live to the local black man.
  Peter: Well, the money helps but I'll always feel my ancestors' pain.
  Hey, from down there does it look like I'm talking into a bunch of
  robot penises?
<back at Griffin house>
Peter: Hey, Lois, come in here and see what I did with the money your
  dad gave me.
  Lois: Oh, my God! You turned the den into Pee-Wee's Playhouse?
  Peter: ? C'mon get up! ? ? Knock off your nappin' ? ? It's a crazy
  messed up place where anything can happen ? ? There's a chair that
  freakin' talks, hey look! ? ? There's some fish that give advice, holy
  crap! ? ? It's screwy in Peter's Playhouse! ?
  Lois: Peter...
  Peter: Wait. Watch this, watch this. Hey, Jambi! Okay, say it.
  Brian: Mekka-lekka-hi, mekka-hiney... God, I hate you so much.
  Lois: Peter, that reparation money should be going to a worthy black
  charity.
  Peter: Lois, the King of Cartoons will be here in five minutes and I
  will not have you embarrass me.
  Lois: You're acting ridiculous!
  Peter: Aah! You said the secret word!
  [Sirens wailing]
  Peter: Uh-oh.
  Cop: Hey, you're that black guy I saw on the news conference, ain't you?
  Peter: Uh, yeah, that's me.
  Cop: This is Car 15; I'm gonna need backup. I got a stolen vehicle here.
  Peter: But this is my car.
  Cop: Suspect's getting belligerent.
  Peter: What?
  Police Officer: Officer down.
  Man: So, it's agreed. We'll keep on pretending to like pig's feet
  simply to confound the white man.
  Peter: Sorry I'm late, you guys. The white man was making me his bitch.
  What? Oh, oh, sorry, his "biatch."
  Cleveland: Peter, we know about your selfish squandering of your
  reparation money. I shared mine. You, however, have given nothing back
  to the community.
  Peter: That's not true. I've brought you the greatest gift of all. A
  child's laughter. [Laughing]
  Cleveland: Peter, I think you should go.
  Peter: Yeah, I'm going.
  [Crowd cheering]
  Peter: Hi, guys. Hey, how's it going? Jeez, Lois, no one wants to sit
  with me. It's like I'm a freakin' leper. Hey, can we sit there?
  Leper: No, these are saved.
  Cheerleader: Where is Cindi?
  Cheerleader 2: I don't know, but she'd better show up soon. It's almost
  halftime.
  Stewie: You know, Cindi, I'd feel worse about this if you didn't spell
  your name with that insufferable "i" at the end. And that cockadoodie
  smiley face you use to dot it! You sicken me! I'm not gonna hurt you.
  I'm not gonna hurt you.
  Peter: [yells]
  Nate Griffin: Hello, Peter.
  Peter: Nate Griffin! Oh, my God! You're haunting me because I've been a
  terrible black man!
  Nate Griffin: Peter, you gotta stop putting so much importance on race.
  I know I didn't.
  Peter: You didn't?
  Nate Griffin: No. If I had, would I have slept with your white
  great-great-great-great granny?
  Peter: No, I guess not.
  Nate Griffin: That's right, and I wouldn't have slept with her fine
  sister neither. You see, the most important thing is how a man acts.
  You know what I'm getting at?
  Peter: You think I should do something good with that reparation money.
  Nate Griffin: That'd be mighty fine, Peter.
  Peter: I guess you're right. Listen, for what it's worth, I'm sorry my
  wife's ancestors made you suffer.
  Nate Griffin: Oh, don't worry about me. If it makes you feel any
  better, I peed in their cereal every morning. Well, so long, Peter.
  Peter: Wait! Before you go-what's Heaven like?
  Nate Griffin: It's fine. There's a shortage of chairs.
  Peter: Oh.
  Nate Griffin: Yeah. Take it easy, Peter.
  Cheerleader: Okay, well, we're just gonna have to go on without her.
  Stewie: Give me a "D!"
  All: "D!"
  Stewie: All right, that's enough of that. Now, there's a large hunting
  knife under each one of your seats. On my command, I want you to....
  You idiots! I had them! Cindi was right. We need a lot more work.
  Peter: Excuse me. Hi, I'm Peter Griffin. Listen, as many of you may
  know, I recently came into some money. Well, I don't really deserve it
  so I've decided to share it with my brothers!
  [Crowd cheering]
  Peter: Actually, I just meant the black guys.
  Lois: Peter, that was very generous. Look how happy you've made
  everyone.
  Peter: Yeah, it just goes to show you, Lois. It doesn't matter if
  you're black or white. The only color that really matters is green.
  Lois: Oh, Peter.
  Cheerleader: I wonder what happened to Cindi.
  Quagmire: Dear diary, Jackpot!
  [Rap version of theme song]



Title: Ready Willing and Disabled

Theme Song
  Tom Tucker: ...Alan Adler, David Preslack, Julie Axlerod, Shep Sutton,
  Scott McCormack. And that concludes the list of people who were mean to
  me in junior high. Tomorrow, high school. Finally, we go to Asian
  reporter Tricia Takanawa for 60 seconds of filler.
  Tricia Takanawa: Thanks, Tom. I'm here on Spooner Street where several
  Quahog families are holding a car wash to raise money for an organ
  transplant for young Paul Lewis. So, what do you call this device, Paul?
  Paul: It's an iron lung. It keeps me from dying. I want to play
  baseball!
  Tricia Takanawa: And with me is one of Paul's classmates, Chris
  Griffin, who helped organize this charity event. You're a very
  thoughtful young man, Chris.
  Chris: Can I say hello to my mom?
  Tricia Takanawa: Sure.
  Chris: Hi, Mom!
  Lois: Hi, sweetheart!
  Stewie: Okay, so, you want the full wash and, uh...oh, you've got a
  nick there. I can probably get that out for you. Now, if you want to go
  with a scent, I've got PB & J, Sugar Cereal, and New Toy. What
  the deuce?
  Chris: Hey, somebody dropped a money clip.
  Meg: Wow! $26.
  Chris: I've never seen so much money at one time!
  Meg: What do you think should we do with it?
  Stewie: I say we buy $26 worth of ice cream and just pig out. Oh, We
  can dish, talk about who's getting fat. Oh, we'll just be great big
  bitches.
  Joe: Hold on, kids. That's not your money yet. The law says you gotta
  put up signs and wait two weeks for someone to claim it. If no one
  does, it's yours. Ah, lunch is here.
  Lois: Everyone, we've reached our goal! It looks like somebody's gonna
  live to see puberty.
  Brian: My God! That man just took our money!
  Joe: What man?
  Lois: He was wearing a Jimmy Carter mask like that robber in that Keanu
  Reeves movie.
  Joe: The Matrix?
  Lois: No, no, no. It wasn't that recent. It was the one where they were
  jumping out of a plane...
  Joe: Executive Decision?
  Lois: No, that was with Kurt Russell. But the other guy in this movie,
  he kind of looks Kurt Russell...
  Meg: He's getting away!
  Joe: Don't worry. He won't get far.
  [Siren wails]
  Joe: Stop! Police!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Joe: [Gasping for breath]
  Peter: Joe, what happened?
  Joe: I got the money.
  Peter: All right, Joe!
  Joe: But I lost the perp.
  Lois: Well, the money's the important thing. Now little Paul can get
  his...Point Break! That was the movie!
  Cleveland: Here's to Joe, who helped little Paul get a new liver and,
  barring a massive infection, a new lease on life.
  Joe: Don't you understand? I lost the perp! I lost the perp! [Sobbing]
  [Screaming]
  Meg: So, um, the $26 would probably be safe in my room.
  Stewie: Right. It'd probably get lost among the pinups of Justin
  Timberlake, and Tom Cruise, and.... Blast! Who the devil do the
  teenagers like? Morgan Freeman.
  Chris: Well, we can't keep it in my room because there's an evil monkey
  that lives in my closet. You know, the sad part is, he wasn't always
  evil.
  Evil Monkey: Honey, good news! I made partner! [Angry shrieking]
  Lois: Peter, Bonnie says Joe's been really depressed about that
  robbery. Why don't you go talk to him?
  Peter: I don't know. There's a game on.
  Angel Peter: Shame on you! You march right over there, and cheer your
  old friend up!
  Devil Peter: Don't listen to that sissy. Grab a beer and watch the game.
  Peter: Yeah. That sounds good. Oh, my God!
  Angel Peter: Now, get your fat ass over to Joe's!
  Peter: Look, buddy, I...
  Angel Peter: Move!
  Peter: All right. Just take it easy, just take it easy, man.
  Everything's cool. Hey, buddy.
  Joe: Close the door! I don't want to see the light.
  Peter: Come on, Joe. Cheer up, huh? Hey, what do you say you and me go
  roller-skate...bike ride...jump rope...go lay on the grass?
  Joe: Peter, the other day was the first time I've ever lost a perp. It
  was also the first time I've ever really felt handicapped. I've made up
  my mind about this. I'm quitting the force.
  Peter: Oh, come on, Joe. You don't have to quit the force. I mean, you
  could get a desk job. You could be a desk.
  Joe: Forget it! I'm washed up.
  Tom Tucker: In local news, Quahog will soon play proud host to the
  Special People's Games. If you and/or a friend are disabled and would
  like to challenge yourself and raise your self-esteem, sign up today!
  Peter: Joe, that's it! You got to compete in the Special People's Games.
  Joe: Gosh! I-I don't know, Peter. Do you really think I can?
  Peter: Hey, I'm the guy that believed you could be a desk. Come on!
  I'll even be your coach!
  Joe: All right! Let's do it!
  Tom Tucker: Coming up in this half hour, our undercover expose on
  conveniently placed news reports in television shows. But first, Peter,
  look out for that skateboard.
  Finneous: Had a bit of a row with a fellow in the steam room.
  Barnaby: You don't say!
  Finneous: Gave him a cauliflower ear.
  Barnaby: Bully!
  Peter: Come on! Come on! Two more.
  Joe: Peter, you're pushing me too hard.
  Peter: Trust me, Joe. I know physical fitness. I was in Richard
  Simmons' Sweatin' to Books on Tape.
  Mitch Albom: The Red Sox were in town. But I didn't care because it was
  Tuesday, and I was on my way to see Morrie. He couldn't go to the
  bathroom by himself anymore. But his indomitable spirit...
  Peter: So, how does he check out, Doc? Is my boy ready to compete?
  Dr. Hartman: Um, I don't quite know how to tell you this, Mr. Swanson.
  You're paralyzed from the waist down.
  Joe: I know.
  Dr. Hartman: Oh, thank God! Oh, God, I was standing out there for,
  like, 10 minutes! Boy, is that a load off!
  Peter: Mort, Joe here's gonna be competing in the Special People's
  Games. You got anything that might give him extra juice?
  Mort: You mean steroids? But, Peter, haven't you seen what happens to
  those ladies on ESPN2? They get big hair faces, and their breasts
  become like flapjacks!
  Peter: I was thinking more like a protein shake.
  Mort: Oh, God, I'm sorry! Aisle 3, next to the creams. Ooh, I don't
  like saying that word.
  Announcer: We now return to Touched by an Angel.
  Lawyer: Now, where exactly did the angel touch you?
  Boy: Here.
  Angel: Oh, come on! Who're you gonna believe? I got a freakin' halo!
  Meg: 'Bye! I'm going to the mall!
  Chris: What are you going to the mall for?
  Meg: Don't worry. The $26 is safe.
  Stewie: Safe, huh? The skirt's trying to pull a fast one. Knuckles, get
  the handbag!
  Chris: Right, boss!
  Meg: Hey! Give me my purse, you psycho!
  Stewie: Let's see. Makeup, chewing gum, a picture of Meg in a two-piece
  swimsuit. Oh, God! I pray this is not my first memory!
  Brian: Look, everybody cool it! I am not going to put up with this
  racket for two weeks. I'll hold onto the money. I'm a neutral party, so
  it'll be safe.
  Chris: Okay.
  Meg: All right.
  Stewie: I suppose we can trust you.
  Meg: Now, where is it?
  Stewie: What the...oh, very clever. Take another reach. You forgot your
  change.
  Tom Tucker: Hello, and welcome to the Quahog Special People's Games.
  I'm Tom Tucker.
  Diane Simmons: And I'm Diane Simmons. It's a great day to be alive,
  Tom, able-bodied or not.
  Tom Tucker: It sure is, Diane. Today we'll see some of Quahog's finest
  athletes struggle valiantly against God's twisted designs. You'll
  cheer, you'll cry, you might even get a cheap laugh or two.
  Diane Simmons: I know I will, Tom. In fact, there's the distinct
  possibility that, by the end of the day, we'll all be going to Hell.
  Tom Tucker: I'll see you there, Diane.
  Diane Simmons: Oh, it sounds like the opening ceremonies have begun.
  There are the paraplegics. Followed by the blind team.
  Tom Tucker: Still no sign of the deaf team, I notice.
  [Phones ringing, alarms buzzing] [Knocking]
  Man 1: Hey, you guys are gonna be late!
  Man 2: Maybe they're not in there.
  Diane Simmons: And now, we turn our attention to the lighting of the
  flame.
  Tom Tucker: And these games are underway! We begin with the 100-meter
  dash for people afraid of yellow tape.
  Diane Simmons: It's anybody's race now, Tom!
  Tom Tucker: And it's Odai Mutambo of Kenya!
  Joe: The decathlon. I don't know. That's quite a mountain to climb,
  Peter.
  Peter: Joe, look at me! Look at me! Do I have food in my teeth?
  Joe: No.
  Peter: Oh, great. Thank God! Now, listen here, Joe. You and I both know
  you have what it takes to win this thing. So, get out there and do it,
  huh?
  Disabled Ass: That gold medal is mine, pretty boy. You don't have a
  chance in Hell.
  Joe: He may be right, Peter.
  Peter: Joe, he's an android. Don't let him push you around. You can do
  this. I know you can.
  Joe: Yeah. Yeah! Hey, you think you're so hot, fella? Well, at least I
  can do this. [Sings arpeggio]
  Disabled Ass: [Sings monotone] Oh, crap!
  Joe: Let's do it!
  Tom Tucker: Let's go to the first decathlon event of the day, the pole
  vault, where Joe Swanson takes his starting position.
  Peter: Yeah! Way to go, Joe!
  Joe: Yeah! How do you like that, buddy?
  Disabled Ass: A sphincter says what?
  Joe: What?
  Disabled Ass: Ha-ha-ha-ha. You stupid bastard.
  Stewie: Good to see your new fiscal responsibilities haven't interfered
  with your reading. Ah, Dostoyevsky-the Mad Russian. Good stuff, good
  stuff.
  Brian: You're not gonna get the $26, and you're despicable for trying.
  Stewie: Oh, you thought.... I wasn't trying to get the $26. I thought
  we were just having a perfectly innocent conversation about literature.
  Oh, you're silly. You're silly. I love that you'd go there. You're
  silly. Good-bye.
  Tom Tucker: We'll take you to bulimic pie-eating in just a moment. But
  first, decathlon front-runner Joe Swanson, will attempt the long jump.
  Peter: Come on, Joe! Break a wheel!
  Joe: I'm ready. Let's get it on!
  [Crowd cheers]
  Tom Tucker: Ooh, short jump. That'll knock him out of the lead. Tough
  break.
  Diane Simmons: Tough break it is, Tom.
  Tom Tucker: Good contribution, Diane. If Swanson expects to take the
  gold he's going to have to come in first in the final event, the
  100-meter dash.
  Peter: That's okay, Joe. You can still win this thing.
  Disabled Ass: That was pathetic. Tell your wife to come over to my
  place if she wants a little boom-shacka-lacka-lacka-lacka
  boom-shaka-lacka-lacka-lacka boom-shaka-lacka-lacka-lacka boom.
  Joe: Peter, it's over.
  Peter: Over? What are you talking about?
  Joe: If I couldn't catch a two-bit criminal, how am I supposed to win a
  race?
  Peter: Hey, what kind of talk is that? It's un-American! Did George W.
  Bush quit even after losing the popular vote? No! Did he quit after
  losing millions of dollars of his father's friends' money in failed oil
  companies? No! Did he quit after knocking that girl up? No! Did he quit
  after he got that DUI? No! Did he quit gettin' arrested for drunk and
  disorderly conduct at a football game? No! Did he quit...
  Joe: I get the message, Peter.
  [music to Jim Croce's "I Got a Name"]
  Mort: ? And I carry it with me like my daddy did ? ? If you're goin my
  way, I'll go with you. ? ? Movin' me down the highway ?
  Joe: Gee, Peter! This water tastes kinda funny.
  Peter: You mean like ha-ha, Jerry Seinfeld funny or Elayne Boosler,
  "God bless her, she's trying" funny?
  Referee: Racers, on your mark!
  Peter: Go get 'em, Joe!
  Referee: Get set!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Peter: Yeah!
  Tom Tucker: And Joe Swanson wins the gold medal!
  Peter: You did it, Joe!
  Joe: We did it, Peter!
  [crowd cheering]
  Child: Mommy, look at the ladybu-aaah!
  Jim Kaplan: Hey, Greased Lightnin'!
  Joe: Do I know you?
  Jim Kaplan: Jim Kaplan, sports agent. You like this car?
  Joe: Yeah.
  Jim Kaplan: It's yours. You like my pants?
  Joe: Uh, sure.
  Jim Kaplan: They're yours! You know what a merkin is?
  Joe: No.
  Jim Kaplan: Pubic wig. I got one. You want it?
  Joe: No!
  Jim Kaplan: Course, you don't, you're a classy guy! You want to be rich?
  Joe: Yes!
  Jim Kaplan: Sign here.
  Peter: What the hell? I just don't understand how he could do that
  without me. We were gonna do everything together!
  Brian: It was one cereal ad, Peter. Besides, he's the one who won the
  medal.
  Peter: Yeah, I guess.
  Announcer: Coming to ABC, the simple story of a man and his chair.
  Rolling Courage: the Joe Swanson Story.
  Peter: What the hell is this?
  Announcer: Starring Tony Danza as Joe Swanson. Once a man at his
  physical peak, brought down by a cruel twist of fate.
  Tony Danza: Why?
  Announcer: With Valerie Bertinelli as Bonnie.
  Valerie Bertinelli: Joe, you've got to accept your limitations.
  Tony Danza: Why don't you just ask me to lay down and die?
  Valerie Bertinelli: I can't live like this anymore!
  Tony Danza: That's it!
  Peter: That's not how it happened! It was my idea!
  Announcer: With Bea Arthur as Peter Griffin.
  Bea Arthur: You'll never make it, Joe! Why don't you just give up right
  now?
  Tony Danza: No. I've got to try! Even if it's by myself.
  Bea Arthur: You're a fool, Joe! A fool!
  Announcer: Rolling Courage: The Joe Swanson Story. Friday on ABC,
  followed by Dharma and Greg-but you don't have to watch that.
  Peter: I don't believe this. Joe wouldn't be famous if it hadn't been
  for me. How come he's getting all the glory?
  Brian: He's handicapped. That's what makes his story so inspirational.
  Peter: Handicapped...hmmm. Aaah! How did these get up here?
  Chris: What the hell is this, Brian?
  Brian: It's my new passport. What are you doing going through my mail?
  Meg: You weren't planning on going somewhere with our $26, were you?
  Brian: Oh, for God's sake! I just had the damn thing renewed! What's
  the matter with you?
  Stewie: You're obviously taking us for saps. But we're not. Now, fess
  up, or I'll do to you what I did to John Lennon.
<Stewie at art gallery>
Stewie: John, have you met Yoko? Yoko, John?
Brian: You want your money? Fine! I hope you all kill each other.
Stewie: All right, I know how to settle this. Whoever wants the money
  raise your hand! Ho, ho, you're smarter than I thought. Give yourselves
  a round of applause. Damn!
  Tom Tucker: Yeah, honey, I'm gonna be late tonight. I've got a hooker
  coming over. Well, I know it's late notice, but what about the pool
  guy? He likes you.
  Intern: Mr. Tucker, Mr. Griffin's here to see you.
  Tom Tucker: I got to go.
  Peter: Mr. Tucker, I have just become handicapped like Joe Swanson. And
  I demand commercial endorsements and a TV movie based on me, starring
  Valerie Bertandernie.
  Tom Tucker: But, Mr. Griffin...
  Peter: I even got the first piece you're gonna run-exclusive video
  footage of my tragic accident. "Oh, no! A car going too fast to stop in
  time! Aaeeee! I'm handicapped now! Ah!"
  Tom Tucker: Mr. Griffin, you can't possibly expect me to believe this.
  That was clearly a scarecrow dressed in your clothes.
  Peter: Oh, come on!
  Tom Tucker: And when I freeze-frame...that's you driving the car.
  Peter: Well, there's your hook!
  Tom Tucker: Get out.
  Mayor West: Today we're here to honor Joe Swanson for pulling my poor
  one-eyed cat, Bootsie, out of the old stove pipe of my grandmother's
  cabin. Joe Swanson won the Special People's Decathlon, and we're here
  to honor him.
  Peter: Backstabber.
  Lois: Oh, Peter, I'm sure Joe's gonna acknowledge you. You'll see.
  Peter: Don't forget our deal, Lois. I sit through this, and later
  tonight I get anal. You hear me? No matter how neat I want the house,
  you have to clean it.
  Joe: Thank you, thank you. You know, no one can win a gold medal by
  himself. It takes friends. And I want to acknowledge a special friend
  in the audience today. My friend Peter...Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul
  and Mary! Let's give him a hand, folks. But that's nothing compared to
  what this next man did. He challenged me to go that extra mile. And
  that man is Mr. Griffin...Comedian Eddie Griffin, get up here! Your
  acerbic anti-white humor was a constant inspiration, thank you, sir.
  And last but not least, who could forget the fat guy? Chef Paul
  Prudhomme! You get your Cajun ass up here!
  Paul Prudhomme: Why? I didn't even do anything!
  Peter: That's it! Excuse me, but there's someone else he didn't thank!
  Mr. Steroid! That's how he won!
  Joe: That's not true!
  Peter: Yes, it is. I put steroids in your water bottle right before the
  last race.
  [crowd booing]
  Joe: I'm sorry, everybody. I've let you all down.
  Disabled Ass: Yes. You suck. I rule. Who da man? Who da man? Who da man?
  Meg: All right. If anyone tries to lift the glass, the bell will ring.
  Chris: Well then, let's all go to bed.
  Stewie: Off we go then.
  [Thunder clapping]
  Meg: Stop!
  [Punching, kicking, yelling] [Doorbell rings]
  Brian: Did you find the place okay?
  Mr. Taylor: No problem.
  Brian: Hey, kids!
  Stewie: I only had soup. I don't see why we should split the bill
  evenly.
  Brian: Wake up! This is Mr. Taylor. He's here for the money clip.
  Meg: Oh!
  Chris: Oh!
  Stewie: [a la Charlie Brown] Aauughh!
  Lois: Peter, you should go talk to him. After all, you set out to make
  him feel better, and now he's worse than ever.
  Peter: I don't know, Lois. He's probably waiting to be interviewed by
  Dan Rather or that dreadful Gene Shalit.
  Lois: I think those days are over now, Peter.
  Peter: Uh, hey there.
  Joe: Uh, hi, Peter.
  Peter: Listen, Joe, about this whole mess...
  Joe: Hold it, Peter! That's the car-wash thief!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Mr. Taylor: A-ha! Tough luck, wheelie!
  Joe: Yeah, for you! I'm Joe, your waiter. Today's special is justice,
  served cold, with a side of jail! And order the souffle now, 'cause it
  takes 10 to 15 years!
  [at the Drunken Clam]
  Joe: Hey, Peter, I really appreciate what you did for me.
  Peter: What do you mean?
  Joe: Well, that slimy agent had me believing the hype. I forgot it was
  really you who got me to believe in myself again. Oh, and by the way,
  I'm going back to the force.
  Peter: Good for you. Hey, what happened to the car-wash thief?
  Joe: Ironically, I severed his spine when I landed on him.
  Peter: Looks like you got more competition at next year's games, huh?
  Joe: Nope, he's dead.
  [Theme music]



Title: A Very Special Family Guy Freakin Christmas

Theme Song
  [Instrumental Christmas music]
  Chris: Merry Christmas, dude. Don't put it in your nose. It burns like
  hell.
  Cleveland: Merry Christmas, everybody. As president of the Quahog
  Chamber of Commerce, I'd like to thank the Seniors' Center for
  decorating our tree.
  Senior: Oop, broke my hip!
  Lois: Look, honey. There's the manger for the Christmas pageant. You're
  gonna make the cutest baby Jesus ever.
  Stewie: So, you want to dress me up and trot me about like a circus
  poodle, hmm? Here, let me consult my agent, Mr. Irving R. Pointy Stick!
  Lois: Oh, Stewie, no sweets before dinner.
  Meg: Mom, I'm freezing. Can we go home?
  Lois: In a minute. Would you just look at this beautiful tree? Every
  year I look up at that star and I think of all of the joy and wonder
  that Christmas promises. And that miracle that occurred on that silent
  winter's night.
  Peter: Hey, I'm on vacation! Happy birthday, Jesus! ? Seven maids
  a-milking, six maids a-milking, five maids a-milk... ?
  Lois: Brian, you're not wearing the sweater I made you.
  Brian: Uh, well, it's a little warm in here, you know?
  Lois: "Don we now our gay apparel"
  Brian: Doesn't get much gayer than this.
  Lois: Peter, tomorrow's Christmas Eve and you still haven't gotten us a
  tree.
  Peter: Lois, I told you I'm on dipsaluscious vacation. What part of
  that don't you understand?
  Lois: Come on, honey. It's the only thing I've asked you to do. Please?
  Peter: Brian, tape this for me.
  Brian: Sorry. The VCR hasn't worked since you tried to tape Monday
  Night Football.
  FBI Agent: Do you have the express written consent of ABC Sports and
  the National Football League?
  Peter: Just ABC.
  [Guns cocking, then gunfire]
  Lois: Well, if you get us a tree, I'll make sure Santa brings you a new
  VCR. Please?
  Peter: Oh, crap. How come I...commercial! [Chopping tree]
  Meg: Hey, Mom, I got something to add to my Christmas list. A pair of
  those jeweled bug barrettes. Not costume, real. Maybe you should write
  that down?
  Lois: Santa got all his shopping done before the rush. I think you'll
  be very happy.
  Chris: I just want peace on Earth. That's better than being selfish
  like Meg, right? So I should get more than her.
  Peter: Here's the tree. Merry Christmas to all and to all shut the hell
  up.
  Lois: Uh-uh-uh, before you sit down, we're due at Joe and Bonnie's for
  eggnog.
  Peter: Lois, can't we tell them that your mother died?
  Lois: Peter, I'm not gonna lie about something like that.
  Peter: All right, all right, I'll kill your mother. God, when did
  Christmas become so complicated?
  [at the Swansons]
  Peter: So, uh, you guys know that Rudolph is on, right?
  Lois: Peter!
  Bonnie: Thank you for the lovely gingerbread house, Lois.
  Joe: Oh, yeah! It's perfect for all the happy, active gingerbread men.
  Except for the one with no legs! Look at the parents telling their kids
  not to stare. "How does his pee-pee work, Mommy?" Well, I've got news
  for you, Becky. Not so well!
  Bonnie: Joe, you promised. It's Christmas. Joe had his accident at
  Christmas time.
  Lois: [Nervous laughter]
  Carolers: "Check the balls on Uncle Charlie"
  Peter: Yes! Time to go a-wassailing!
  Quagmire: Hey, Peter.
  Cleveland: Hi. I'm Prancer.
  Lois: Hey, why don't you take Joe along?
  Peter: Yeah, Lois. That'll be about as much fun as a lecture on
  ontological empiricism.
  Lois: What?
  Peter: What?
  Lois: Honey, he could use some Christmas spirit. For me? Please?
  Peter: All right. But you owe me later, under the mistletoe. Open
  mouth, no matter how drunk I am.
  Lois: Peter, the gifts are hidden in the trunk. Don't forget to drop
  off the one for Toys for Toddlers.
  Peter: All right, all right. Hey, somebody give me a beer.
  Quagmire: Heads up.
  Joe: Yeah, Peter, one of us has to be the designated driver. And I've
  already had four eggnogs. So I guess you're it.
  Peter: That's a good one, Joe. Way to get into the spirit.
  Joe: I'm a cop first and a buddy second. So don't think I wouldn't
  throw your drunk-driving ass in the slammer! All right, let's a-wassail!
  Lois: Stewie, honey, time for bed. You have a big day tomorrow, baby
  Jesus.
  Stewie: Trust me, woman, if I could walk on water, I would stroll you
  out to the middle of a lake and hold your head under until the bubbles
  stopped!
  Lois: Someone's being naughty, not nice. You know, Santa's watching you.
  Stewie: What the devil do you mean, "watching"?
  Lois: Well, honey, Santa's making a list and checking it twice.
  Meg: He sees you when you're sleeping.
  Chris: And he knows when you're awake. I almost caught him last year.
  But he's magic!
  Stewie: Constant surveillance of every child on Earth? Impossible!
  Unless...hidden cameras. Oh, very clever. Watching to see if I'm
  naughty, are you? Well, check this twice!
  Joe, Quagmire, Cleveland: ? Rock the boat ?
  Cleveland: ? Don't rock the boat, baby ?
  Joe, Quagmire, Cleveland: ? Rock the boat ?
  Cleveland: ? Don't tip the boat over ?
  Joe, Quagmire, Cleveland: ? Rock the boat ?
  Cleveland: ? Don't rock the boat, baby ?
  Joe, Quagmire, Cleveland: ? Rock the boat! ?
  Joe: Rock on!
  Quagmire: Hey, guys. Check me out! Whoa!
  [Dog whimpering]
  Joe: [Grunting] [Screaming] Oh, no! I've broken my legs!
  Peter: That's about as funny as Sinbad. Not the comedian, he's
  hilarious-the sailor. But then again, he was never meant to be funny.
  Now come on. I gotta go to freakin' Toys for Toddlers.
  Cleveland: Sounds like somebody's got a humbug up his butt.
  Quagmire: Maybe we should set him up with another lemon snow cone, eh?
  Peter: No, thanks. The last one you gave me didn't taste like lemon at
  all! It tasted like...oh, you guys are asses!
  Santa: I knew you were awake.
  Stewie: You!
  [Tense instrumental music]
  Santa: Now, Stewie, you are in my power.
  Stewie: No, damn you! Damn you, let me go!
  Santa: Good, Melvin. Nice work, Woodrow. Excellent, Stewie.
  [Sinister instrumental music]
  Stewie: Aah! It was just a dream. I needn't fear this Santa. If he were
  truly omnipotent, he'd have the testicular fortitude to show himself!
  See? I'm just barking at the dark. No one here but me. [nervously
  humming] All right, where is it? Where's the wire? Show yourself, Claus!
  Lois: Stewie, go to sleep!
  Stewie: This doesn't involve you, Lois!
  Lois: I don't want to have to come in there.
  Stewie: I don't want to have to come in there!
  Meg: Sh. Dad's awake.
  Peter: Don't bother whispering. I don't have a hangover.
  Brian: It's a Christmas miracle!
  Peter: Shouldn't you have your sweater on?
  Brian: [Groaning]
  Lois: [kiss] That's for letting Joe join in your reindeer games. Now
  you go relax while I make my little Christmas angel a big stack of
  pancakes.
  Peter: If I'm sleeping, just stuff 'em in my mouth and rub my throat.
  Lois: Just one more thing.
  Peter: Lois!
  Lois: I need you to take the presents out of the trunk.
  Brian: Aren't you gonna do it?
  Peter: It's already done. I dropped them all off at Toys for Toddlers
  last night.
  Brian: All? Peter, only one gift was for charity. The rest were for the
  family.
  Peter: No. The rest were "from" the family. Weren't they? Oh, crap.
  Since when did they change the meaning of "for" to "from"?
  Brian: I think they had a meeting about it last night.
  Peter: Why wasn't I told?
  Brian: They sent you a card. But it said "For Peter" on it. So you
  must've thought it was "from" you, so you didn't...you know, it's just
  easier to call you stupid.
  Brian: You're really gonna take back donated gifts on Christmas Eve?
  Peter: Yep. Now here's the plan. You'll enter through the air
  conditioning duct here. Now, there'll be an invisible laser grid three
  inches above the floor. So you'll have to compress your body to the
  size of a household sponge and slide underneath like some kind of weird
  amphibious dolphin.
  Brian: Can I buy some pot from you?
  Hick mother: What 'choo want?
  Hicks: [Hollering]
  Peter: So you understand all these gifts were supposed to be for my
  family. It was just some crazy mix-up.
  Hick Mother: Kill 'em.
  Hick Father: [Pumps shotgun]
  Peter: No, no, no. It's true. You see, that remote control cow was for
  my son. And those barrettes were for my daughter. And, uh.... Hey,
  where's my VCR?
  Hick Child 1: Dang it, Buck. It's my turn to use the sex box!
  Buck: It's my sex box! And her name is "Sony."
  Lois: You gave away all the presents?
  Peter: Lois, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than
  you can possibly imagine.
  Lois: Peter, you brought glad tidings to a family less fortunate than
  your own.
  Peter: You mean you're not mad?
  Lois: Well, I am little irritated that I have to do all the shopping
  again. But at least some good came out of it.
  Peter: So I can drink beer and watch TV? 'cause, you know, KISS Saves
  Santa's on.
  Ace Frehley: But, Mrs. Claus, who would kidnap Santa?
  Mrs. Claus: Well, Ace, that's what I want you boys to find out.
  Gene Simmons: Someone stole Santa? That does not rock!
  Paul Stanley: Easy, Gene. Guys, let's go save Christmas. To the KISS
  Copter!
  KISS: [Cheering]
  [Adventurous instrumental music]
  Lois: You can watch all the TV you want-[kiss]-just as soon as we get
  back from the mall.
  Peter: The mall? On Christmas Eve?
  Lois: Peter, I just want this family to have a perfect Christmas. And I
  need a little help, okay? Brian, my turkey's in the oven. Can you turn
  it off at 3:00?
  Brian: No problem.
  Lois: We'll shop, come home, eat, and then it's off to the pageant to
  see our little Stewie play baby Jesus.
  Stewie: Oh, yes, yes. By all means, turn me into a child star. Perhaps
  I can move to Cal-i-for-ni-a and wrangle me a three-way with the Olsen
  twins.
  [Brakes squeaking]
  Lois: There's a spot!
  [Tires screeching]
  Peter: Ah, screw this.
  Lois: Okay, Peter. We'll each take half the list to save time. Kids,
  why don't you take Stewie to see Santa?
  Stewie: Santa?
  [Menacing instrumental music]
  Stewie: No, it's not possible! Sitting alone in this public setting? No
  bullet-proof glass? Claus, you make it too easy. Change me! I've leaked
  through my ski pants and I won't face him wet!
  Announcer: We now return to Bob Hope's Christmas with the Troops.
  Bob Hope: It's good to see you Union boys. I would've been here sooner,
  but Lincoln gave me the wrong "Gettysburg Address." How about this
  having to sit still for 60 seconds to have your picture taken? How
  'bout that?
  Peter: Sweet! It's KISS Saves Santa.
  Ace Frehley: Hang on, Santa. We're coming.
  Santa: Hurry, boys. The eggs are hatching!
  Peter Kriss: What do we do?
  Paul Stanley: Wait a second. Everyone knows pterodactyls can't stand
  the screech of a guitar!
  [Heavy metal guitar]
  Gene Simmons: It's working!
  KISS: Hey, Santa, be careful! Oh, no! Hang on, Santa!
  Peter: Hey, I was watching that! Hey!
  Clerk: It'll be on next Christmas.
  Peter: Who the hell knows when that's gonna be?
  [Oven timer dings] [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Brian: Ah! If I was an oven mitt...
  [Smoke detector ringing]
  Brian: Damn it, Peter!
  Santa: Ho, ho, ho. And what can I bring you this year?
  Stewie: Oh, a peace offering is it? Very well, what say you trim those
  gin-soaked whiskers and bring me some plutonium?
  Santa: Well, can you be a good boy?
  Stewie: Your inquiry intrigues me. Can any of us be a good boy? Are our
  primal urges innate, or the result of the choices we make?
  Santa: Okay. Wrap it up, kid.
  Stewie: All right, Kringle! If the reward is plutonium, then your wager
  is accepted. I will be "nice."
  Santa: Good boy! Now smile for the camera.
  Stewie: Yes, yes. Smile, like a good boy.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Brian: Aaaaaah!
  Peter: Aha, Meg's barrettes.
  Old Woman: You mean, Julie's barrettes!
  Peter: You still want 'em, you bony old blue hair? Ow, ow! Tittie
  twister! Ow, hurts!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Peter: Aha! All the clown fish and yellow tangs in the world can't help
  you now. That's it? Fish food? That's your ace in the hole? Hahaha! Oh,
  God! Ow, ow, ow!
  Brian: Turkey!
  [Valve squeaking]
  Brian: [Screaming]
  Peter: Oh, Lois, it was horrible. The fish were jumping all over my
  eyes and in my nose. And on the way out, I think one of them muttered
  something anti-Semitic.
  Lois: We're almost home, honey. Oh, look. There's the star on the town
  Christmas tree. We're following it home just like the Three Wise Men.
  Wise Man 3: So, what did you get him?
  Wise Man 1: Gold.
  Wise Man 2: Gold? I thought we agreed on a $5 limit here?
  Wise Man 3: Yeah. I just got him a crappy little bottle of myrrh.
  Wise Man 2: Hello! Frankincense! You always do this!
  Wise Man 3: Okay, okay. Look, we'll put everything together and put all
  our names on it.
  Wise Man 1: No!
  Wise Man 3: Yes!
  Wise Man 1: No! You can't…
  Lois: [Gasping] Oh, my God! Brian, are you okay?
  Chris: I told you we should've left cookies for Santa.
  Peter: [Hollering] My couch! My TV! What the hell did you do?
  Brian: Me? Who the hell buys a novelty fire extinguisher?
  Peter: I'll tell you who. Someone who cares enough about physical
  comedy to put his whole family at serious risk.
  Lois: Boys, please. It's Christmas Eve. This is a night for magic, and
  wonder, and joy. Okay, so a couple of things have gone wrong. But we
  can still have a great Christmas.
  Peter: [Sighing] Aw jeez, kids. You know, I was this close to losing
  it. But your mom's right.
  Lois: Well, sure I am. Meg, honey, get me some paper towels. Let's lose
  the bad tidings, clean up this mess, and find that holiday cheer.
  All: [Muttering in agreement]
  Meg: We're out of paper towels.
  Lois: No paper towels? [Screaming]
  Peter: Hey, I was gonna pick at that.
  Lois: Shut your fat mouth! You all think Christmas just happens? You
  think all this goodwill just falls from the freakin' sky? Well, it
  doesn't! It falls out of my holly jolly butt! So, you can cook your own
  damn turkey and wrap your own damn presents! And while you're at it,
  you can all ride a one-horse open sleigh to hell! [Screaming] [Panting
  maniacally]
  Meg: Oh. Here's the paper towels.
  George Bailey: I-I changed my mind! Clarence, I want to live again!
  [Screaming]
  [Jolly instrumental music]
  Frosty the Snowman: Hey, I guess there's some magic in that old silk
  hat.
  Lois: [snarling]
  Frosty the Snowman: Merry Christmas!
  Kid 1: Easy, lady.
  Lois: You want some of this! [Mindless cackling]
  Frosty the Snowman: Ah! What the hell is her problem?
  Kid 2: Frosty, let it go!
  Frosty the Snowman: Just a second, just a second. Hey, lady, you got
  something to say to me?
  Kid 2: Yeah, all he did was wish you a Merry Christmas.
  Lois: Wish? It's easy to wish. But does anyone take responsibility and
  make it happen? No! You all expect someone else to do it for you like
  Santy Claus or Mommy!
  Frosty the Snowman: [Screaming] What the.... Ah! Take it off! Take it
  off!
  [Eerie instrumental music]
  Lois: Must kill star.
  Chris: Dad, what happened to Mom? What if she never comes back?
  Peter: I think the bigger question is if this is the way she's gonna
  act at Christmas do we even want her back?
  Stewie: Which is better? Around the waist or off the shoulder? Waist?
  Shoulder? Waist? Shoulder?
  Meg: Stewie, I thought you didn't want to be in the pageant.
  Stewie: Oh, Megan, Santa would think it terribly naughty of me not to
  fulfill my obligation to Mother. You know how much the pageant means to
  her.
  Chris: Where do you think she is?
  Peter: Well, thank God years ago I planted a homing device in your
  mother's skull for just such an occasion.
  [Beeping]
  Peter: I forgot. I also put 'em in a bunch of squirrels. This isn't
  goint to do us any good. May as well see if she's at the pageant.
  Lois: You lied to me.
  Meg: Oh, my God! There's Mom!
  Peter: Hi, Lois! Hey, do we look like ants down here?
  Lois: Bite me!
  Joe: Peter, great time last night. Don't worry. We'll get Lois down.
  Sniper: Locked and loaded, sir.
  Meg: Wait. You can't shoot my mom!
  Joe: Don't worry, kid. It's just a mild sedative. Go!
  Peter: All right, hang on. Look, Lois is only up there because we
  sucked the Christmas spirit right out of her. Maybe if she sees the
  pageant it'll bring her around. Give her a chance, eh?
  Brian: Trust him, Joe. This man has seen every Christmas special ever
  made.
  Joe: Are you wearing a girl's sweater?
  Brian: Does that really matter right now?
  Joe: You got 10 minutes.
  Peter: Lights, please.
  Peter: As we all know, Christmas is that mystical time of year when the
  ghost of Jesus rises from the grave to feed on the flesh of the living.
  So we all sing Christmas carols to lull him back to sleep.
  Bob: Outrageous! How dare he say such blasphemy! I've gotta do
  something!
  Man: Bob, there's nothing you can do.
  Bob: [Sighing] Well, I guess I'll just have to develop a sense of humor.
  Bonnie: I am the Virgin Mary. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
  Oh, Our Savior has arrived.
  Stewie: Good evening. I am playing the role of Jesus. A man once
  portrayed on the big screen by Jeffrey Hunter. You may remember him as
  the actor who was replaced by William Shatner on Star Trek. Apparently
  Mr. Hunter was good enough to die for our sins but not quite up to the
  task of seducing green women. Anyhoo, the perennial dictum is to spread
  goodwill towards all men. The irony of course is that this is contrary
  to our nature. So why do we do it? Because we are being watched! And so
  we unselfishly think of others, assured that our good behavior will be
  rewarded with love and plutonium.
  Peter: She's not getting it. Okay, boys, take her down.
  [Griffin house]
  Peter: Merry Christmas, buddy.
  Brian: Wonder what this could be...oh.
  Chris: This Christmas rocks!
  Meg: Mom, Stewie's opening his gifts. Mom?
  Peter: It's okay, Meg. Your mom's just full of Christmas cheer and
  enough tranquilizer to bring down a bull elephant. Uh, honey, you got a
  little something...you got a little...I'll get it.
  Stewie: Hungry Hungry Hippos? Claus, you porcine double-crosser! And to
  think I was nice.
  Brian: You got another one, dude.
  Stewie: [gasping] Plutonium! He is real! He's really, really real!
  Brian: So, Peter, did you get everything you wanted for Christmas?
  Peter: You bet. A week's vacation, a new VCR. And best of all, my own
  copy of KISS Saves Santa.
  Ace Frehley: You just practice that guitar, Santa. Next time we'll let
  you do a solo.
  Mrs. Claus: Don't encourage him!
  Brian: From all of us at Family Guy...
  Meg: ...we wish you Christmas joy.
  Chris: May all your wishes now come true...
  Stewie: ...for every girl and boy.
  Peter: We hope your freakin' holidays are filled with fun and cheer. So
  have a Merry Christmas and...
  Lois: [Incomprehensible mumbling]
  [closing theme music]



Title: Brian Wallows and Peters Swallows

Brian: So, uh, tell me about yourself, Tina.
  Tina: Well, I really love music.
  Brian: Oh, God! Me, too! You know, I just saw Don Giovanni. In my
  opinion, the best opera of the 18th century.
  Tina: Definitely.
  Brian: And the use of recitative throughout.... Mozart was a genius.
  Tina: [Stuttering] Oh, yeah. Reci-ta-tive is really where it's at.
  Waiter: Sir, are we ready to order?
  Brian: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second. You have no idea what I'm
  talking about, do you?
  Tina: Sure I do! Opera's bitchin'! Okay. I guess I'll have the
  es-car-got and a glass of chab-liss.
  Brian: Same here. Es-car-got and the chab-liss.
  [Idle plinking of piano keys]
  Lois: Don't dawdle, Jonas. Play your exercises. Brian, you're home
  early, what happened with your date?
  Brian: Same thing that always happens, she was an idiot.
  Lois: Oh, Brian. Don't slow down Jonas, keep the rhythm. ? Bum, bum,
  bum, bum. Brian, your standards are ridiculously high, you'll never
  find a girl unless you're willing to make exceptions and compromise so
  you can find your love. ?
  Brian: ? Lois, I don't think I have to compromise a thing, I'd rather
  be alone than with someone who doesn't get me, oh, and how long has the
  coffee been on the burner in the kitchen, I could really use a cup
  about now. ?
  Lois: ? Oh, its not very fresh, you see I meant to make more but I made
  the mistake of getting caught up watching Oprah, she had on James
  Garner. ?
  Brian: ? James Garner, what's he plugging? ?
  Lois: ? I don't know, some crappy movie on TNT. ? Very good Jonas, I'll
  see you next week. So what is it Brian, you don't think these women
  understand you? Or...
  Brian: You know, Lois, I'm really not comfortable talking about this
  amelodically.
  Lois: Peter, I was wondering if you could...
  Peter: Hang on a second, Lois
  Announcer: And now back to The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams.
  Ben: Um, Grizzly? Who's Steve?
  Grizzly: What?
  Ben: There's a message on the machine from somebody named Steve.
  Grizzly: Oh, yeah, Steve. He's new to the mountain. I met him down at
  the general store. He makes canoes.
  Ben: Oh. How come I've never met him?
  Grizzly: He hasn't really been here that long.
  Ben: Long enough to get your number!
  Grizzly: Ben! Ben! Damn it.
  Peter: Look at that Grizzly Adams, huh? Look at how confident he is,
  how majestic. Lois, I'm gonna grow a beard.
  Lois: Oh, Peter, you know I hate beards.
  Peter: No, no, Lois. It's time I joined the ranks of great men with
  beards. Why do you think Jesus Christ was so popular? Huh? 'Cause of
  all them magic tricks?
  Lois: Listen, Brian's very depressed. Can you and the guys take him
  with you to the laser rock show tonight?
  Peter: Aw, sure. If there's one thing I'm good at doing, it's cheering
  people up.
  [cut to Peter at funeral graveside]
  Peter: Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, JonBenet's untimely death is a tragedy. And
  I will not rest until I find her killer, or killers.
  Mrs. Ramsey: Oh, really. Don't bother. Nothing's going to bring our
  baby back.
  Peter: No, no, I insist. I will make it my life's work to find out...
  Mr. Ramsey: We're fine! Just drop it!
  Announcer: The next laser rock show will begin in 20 minutes.
  Peter: You hear that, Brian? A laser rock show! Come on, cheer up,
  would you?
  Brian: I don't much feel like it.
  Presenter: Binary is the computer language in which words are
  translated into sequences of zeroes and ones. Anything at all can be
  expressed in binary as we demonstrate in this famous scene from 'The
  Miracle Worker.'
  Annie Sullivan: Zero one, one zero, one zero, zero one.
  Helen Keller: [Incomprehensible gibberish]
  Annie Sullivan: Zero one, one zero, one zero, zero one!
  Helen Keller: [Garbled repetition of binary phrase]
  Annie Sullivan: Zero one! Zero one!
  [Exhibit, 'The Miracle of Electricity.' Old man flicks lamp on and off]
  Old man: What, you don't think this is amazing? When I saw this at the
  1904 World's Fair, I nearly crapped my pants!
  Quagmire: All right! Virtual reality! Whoa, you guys gotta try this!
  Hey, look at me! I'm a pole in a strip club! It's show time. No! Stop!
  False alarm!
  Peter: Oh, my God! I'm flyin', I'm flyin'! [in VR, Peter is seated on
  an airliner] Yes, I'll have a Diet Sprite.
  ["One" by Three Dog Night ("One is the loneliest number...") plays
  under laser show visuals]
  Mayor West: <to own right hand> You are a filthy whore.
  Cleveland: Okay, Johnny Depp or Richard Grieco?
  Quagmire: Ah, that's gross!
  Peter: Yeah, let's not do this!
  Cleveland: Come on. If you're secure in your masculinity, you can
  answer a simple hypothetical.
  Quagmire: All right. Johnny Depp because he kind of looks like a chick,
  I guess.
  Cleveland: What about you, Peter?
  Peter: Oh, man! I don't know. Richard Grieco would probably appreciate
  you more. You know, not take you for granted. I mean with Johnny Depp,
  it's like he wouldn't really need you, you know?. He'd probably sneak
  out after you fell asleep. Of course, with Johnny, you'd get the
  financial security. I'd go with Johnny.
  [Sirens wailing]
  Brian: Oh, great.
  Joe: Brian.
  Brian: Uh, hey, Joe. How's it going?
  Joe: Pretty good. You were doing a little swerving back there.
  Brian: Yeah, me and the boys were just...
  Joe: Whoa, you're off the meter, Brian! You're under arrest.
  Brian: Oh, come on!
  Joe: Move it! One of you guys all right to drive?
  Peter: Um, yeah. I can do it.
  Joe: Great. I'll meet you at the Drunken Clam. We'll tie one on.
  <to Brian> I'm very disappointed in you.
  [Outside courthouse. Title: ONE MONTH LATER]
  Brian: God, a DUI! I can't believe this. I could actually go to jail!
  Lois: It's okay, Brian. You'll get through this DUI, and you'll be a
  better person for it.
  Stewie: Well now, hold on a minute. Don't disguise his alcohol
  dependence as a ticket to self-realization!
  Brian: Look, you're not one to talk, all right? You remember that time
  I gave you apple juice and told you it was wine?
  Stewie: <drunkenly> I think you are a special person.
  Brian: Thanks.
  Stewie: Now, come on! I'm being serious. I'm gonna be serious here for
  a second! Are you gonna listen to me? Are you gonna listen to me so I
  can tell you that I respect you? [Snickering]
  Peter: Brian, I know this is a bad time for you. If I have any advice
  to give you, it is this. Grow a beard.
  Lois: Peter, I wish you'd shave that thing. Beards are so ugly.
  Wooly Willy: Hey!
  Lois: Oh, relax, Wooly Willy. There's lots of fun things you can do
  with that. There we go.
  Wooly Willy: Thanks!
  Judge: On the charge of driving under the influence, this court finds
  you guilty.
  Stewie: Yes! Good call. Churn the butter. Ooo, ooo!
  Judge: In lieu of jail time, I sentence you to 100 hours of community
  service. Next item. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join these
  two in holy matrimony. If anyone objects to this union, speak now or
  forever hold your peace.
  Mayor West: Quiet down! You had your chance!
  Meg: So, what do you have to do for your community service?
  Brian: I got assigned to the Outreach to the Elderly program. I gotta
  take care of some old woman who hasn't been out of her house in 30
  years.
  Chris: When I got caught at school with my hand down my pants I had to
  keep it there for a whole week. Ha! What a week!
  Brian: I don't know, I guess taking care of this old woman'll be just
  like baby-sitting, only with bigger diapers.
  Stewie: Aha! So they do make bigger diapers! That deceitful woman told
  me I'd have to learn to use the toilet. Well, fie on the toilet! It's
  made slaves of you all. I've seen it sitting in there, lazy, slothful,
  porcelain layabout feeding on other people's doo-doos while
  contributing nothing of its own to society! You get a job!
  [Rings doorbell]
  Brian: Uh, Pearl Burton? My name's Brian. I'm here from the Outreach to
  the Elderly program?
  Pearl: You're late!
  [Several locks opening]
  Brian: Ah! What the hell is this?
  Pearl: Delousing powder! Everyone on the outside is filthy!
  Brian: Well, you could have given me some warning!
  Pearl: Here's your warning-it's gonna burn like hell in 30 seconds. I
  like my tea at 4:00, my dinner at 6:00. And I take my bath at 7:00
  sharp, so I can listen to Paul Harvey. You will warm up my bath water
  with quick bursts from the faucet during commercials only. It's going
  to take you a while to get the rhythm-Paul Harvey moves seamlessly into
  commercials. By the way, it's been 30 seconds.
  Brian: [Screaming]
  Lois: Peter, stop scratching that thing.
  Peter: I can't. It's itching like crazy.
  Chris: Dad, can I scratch your beard?
  Peter: Have you finished your homework?
  Chris: Yes.
  Peter: Okay then.
  Lois: Brian, you've been awfully quiet. Is the community service not
  going that well?
  Brian: Lois, it's horrible. I was cleaning her house all day. It's the
  worst job I've ever had. Well, except for one. <cut to Brian in
  apron, offering food samples at the supermarket> Excuse me.
  Would you like to taste my smoked-meat log?
  Waiter: Here you go. Enjoy your food.
  Stewie: Enjoy your studio apartment.
  Lois: Peter, you got a little something right here.
  Peter: Where? Here?
  Lois: No, no, no. Other side.
  Peter: Over here?
  Lois: The left side.
  Peter: Right here?
  Lois: Your other left side.
  Peter: Where am I at?
  Lois: Up a little.
  Peter: Do I have it?
  Lois: Up a little.
  Peter: Is it gone?
  Lois: Now go down.
  Peter: Is it gone? [screams] Is it gone? [screams] Get it off! Get it
  off! Get it off! Get it off!
  Lois: Peter, hold still! Hold still!
  Dr. Goodman Wait, don't touch that bird!
  Peter: What's it to you, pal?
  Dr. Goodman I'm Dr. Goodman of the Quahog Ornithological Society,
  ironically dining in a restaurant that exclusively serves poultry.
  Lois: Doctor, what is this?
  Dr. Goodman Oh, it's a very rare species. The endangered White-Rumped
  Swallow.
  Chris: Ha ha! Rump.
  Peter: This isn't funny, Chris! Ha ha ha, swallow. Look, just get rid
  of this bird, all right?
  Dr. Goodman Unfortunately, I can't do that. Once the swallow has chosen
  its nesting place, it's illegal to disturb it.
  Lois: But, he can't walk around with a bird in his beard.
  Dr. Goodman I'm sorry, you have to wait until the bird departs of its
  own accord or you'll be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
  Meg: Wow! You sure know a lot of stuff.
  Dr. Goodman It's great to learn.
  Diners: 'Cause knowledge is power!
  Pearl: What is this? Spit soup?
  Brian: Tomato bisque.
  Pearl: What is this? Snot soup?
  Brian: Tomato bisque!
  Pearl: What is this? Diarrhea soup?
  Brian: Look, I'm not making you anything else. So, just eat it, all
  right?
  Pearl: Fine! Then I'll have to call the judge, and that means you'll go
  to jail! You're one phone call away from getting a human booster shot
  from a guy named Molly.
  [Peter and Lois are at the movies. The bird keeps eating Peter's
  popcorn]
  Peter: Damn it all! Sorry! Sorry!
  [bird squawks]
  Patrons: Hey, shut up! Keep it down! We're trying to watch-
  Peter: Look, there's nothing I can do, all right?
  Patrons: Take it outside, pal! Ever heard of a sitter?
  Peter: Look, it's an endangered species. What am I supposed to...
  Man: I'll make you an endangered species!
  Peter: Oh, good comeback, Potsie!
  Man: I'll kick your ass, that's what I'll do.
  Peter: Look, everybody just shut up! Shut up! He has stopped squawking.
  He's receded into my beard. We can all watch the movie. Shut up.
  Voice: Eric, if you're in here, we're all going to Marty's after the
  movie.
  Lois: I love you so much.
  Peter: I love you, too, honey.
  Chris: What's wrong?
  Peter: Now that's it. You're history, pal. No bird frenches my wife and
  gets away with it!
  Pearl: Help! Help! I've broken my hip! Brian! 5.3 seconds. I could have
  been dead by now!
  Brian: You mean, you're not really...
  Pearl: I heard you drop that light bulb, too. That'll be 67 cents! Now,
  go warm me up some of that diarrhea soup!
  Brian: That's it! I have had it with you, you old hag! You're just a
  miserable, dried-up shut-in trying to make everyone else feel as bad as
  you do! Why don't you do the world a big favor and drop dead?
  Brian: This last one won't open.
  Pearl: Jiggle it a little bit.
  Brian: Like this?
  Pearl: Nah, here, let me get it.
  Brian: Thanks. And you know-drop dead.
  [Heavy metal rock music]
  Peter: Get out of my beard, you squawking bastard! Nothing. Well, I was
  hoping it wouldn't come to this.
  Lois: Oh my God, Peter, no!
  Peter: Lois, the bird must die!
  [Lois and Peter struggle for the gun, which goes off, breaking the
  window]
  Peter: It's gone! It's gone! Oh, thank God!
  Lois: Peter, what's that sound?
  [Chirping]
  Peter: Oh, my God! They're babies. Hey, look, Lois. There are three of
  them, just like ours. <Chris and Stewie's heads appear on the
  first two birds, then nothing on the third> And uh, um....
  <Boba Fett's head appears on third bird> Sweet.
  Announcer: We now return to E!'s Mysteries and Scandals. Pearl Burton,
  the Jingle Queen.
  Brian: Pearl?
  A.J. Benza: I'm A.J. Benza. You won't find Pearl Burton's name on the
  Hollywood Walk of Fame. Yet from 1945 to 1960, you couldn't turn on a
  radio or television without hearing one of her trademark jingles.
  Pearl: ? You're only healthy when you're tan so soak up all the sun you
  can with Copper-Coppertone! ?
  A.J. Benza: At her peak, Pearl Burton earned 26 grand a year which by
  today's standards would be just under 49 billion dollars.
  Lois: Brian, she's beautiful.
  Brian: Yeah. And that voice. I had no idea.
  A.J. Benza: In 1961, Pearl used an appearance at Carnegie Hall to make
  the leap from jingle-singer to artist.
  Pearl: [sings operatic aria]
  Brian: That's Habanera from Carmen. I've never heard it sung so
  beautifully.
  Audience: Sing Coppertone! Yeah, Coppertone! Do Doan's Pills! Sing Gold
  Bond Medicated Powder! Pepsodent! Chiclets! Chiclets!
  A.J. Benza: No one has seen Pearl Burton since that fateful night over
  30 years ago. She's presumed dead.
  Brian: My God! And I said all those awful things to her!
  [Brian rushes to Pearl's house, where she is about to hang herself]
  Brian: Pearl! Come on, Pearl! Don't do this!
  Pearl: You should be happy! I'm taking your advice and doing the world
  a big favor! Now, move! Your fur is making my feet sweat!
  Brian: Pearl, listen to me. I heard you sing. It was the most beautiful
  sound I've ever heard in my life.
  Pearl: Sure. Warbling for Vicks VapoRub and Dippity-do!
  Brian: No, no, Pearl, I mean...
  Pearl: Ah, stop trying to talk me out of it! I'm a pathetic sellout!
  Brian: No one who sings Carmen like you is pathetic!
  Pearl: What?
  Brian: I heard you sing Habanera. You were sublime.
  Pearl: You liked my aria?
  Brian: I was overwhelmed.
  Pearl: You're the first person who ever complimented my Habanera. Thank
  you.
  Brian: Well, I'd better get going. I'll see you tomorrow.
  Pearl: But you're not scheduled tomorrow.
  Brian: I know.
  [Cheerful instrumental music]
  [Peter and the birds montage]
  Peter: And then the cow came out of the barn. See? See, look. There's
  the cow. And what does a cow say? Yes, yes, that's right. A cow says
  peep-peep-peep-peep.
  Lois: You know, Peter, they're getting awfully big.
  Peter: So?
  Lois: So, every good mother knows when it's time for her babies to
  leave the nest.
  Peter: Hey, they're free to go anytime they want! [birds attempt to
  leave] Fine. I'll let them go.
  Pearl: [sings final notes of Ave Maria]
  Brian: Pearl, do you rent or own?
  Pearl: Own what?
  Brian: Those wings, you angel. That was fantastic. That was so
  incredible.
  Pearl: So, what do you want for dinner? I was thinking about making us
  that lamb and rice you love.
  Brian: Well, you know, Pearl, what I'd really like for dinner is to go
  out.
  Pearl: Brian, you know I can't do that. I haven't left this house in
  such a long time. I'm afraid.
  Brian: I know. But I'll be with you.
  Pearl: I don't know.
  Brian: Come on, Pearl. There's so much you've missed in the last 30
  years. In fact, allow me to fill you in. ? The '60s brought the hippie
  breed And decades later, things have changed indeed We lost the values,
  but we kept the weed You've got a lot to see ?

  White House game We're not too far from voting Feldman-Haim You've got

  surgery day, the doc will see it and say 'Wow, you must really be cool'
  ?
  Tom Tucker: There's lots of things you may have missed.
  Mayor West: Like Pee Wee and his famous wrist.
  Cleveland: Or Sandy Duncan's creepy phony eye.
  Neil Goldman: That awesome Thundercats cartoon.
  Diane Simmons: Neil Armstrong landing on the moon.
  Meg: Neil Armstrong? Wait-was he the trumpet guy?
  Brian: ? So, let's go see the USA They'll treat you right unless you're
  black or gay or Cherokee But you can forgive the world and its flaws
  and follow me there because you've still got a hell of a lot to see
  You've got a lot to see ?
  Pearl: Brian, I've missed so much! I wouldn't be standing here right
  now if it wasn't for you!
  Doctor: She's right in here. Just tell the disorderly when you're ready
  to leave.
  Brian: Don't you mean the orderly?
  Doctor: No, I mean the disorderly. That's a little doctor joke we like
  to make around here. We also like Kevin Pollack.
  Brian: Oh, my God, Pearl!
  Pearl: Brian, I don't have much time.
  Brian: God, I never should have made you leave the house! This is all
  my fault!
  Pearl: Don't be so hard on yourself. Aside from the truck part, this
  was the best day of my life. I only wish we could have a little more
  time together.
  Brian: We can.
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Peter: Good-bye, kids.
  [Heart monitor flatline]
  Brian: Good-bye, Pearl.
  Doctor: Hey, who wants to see a dead body?
  Peter: Rough week, huh?
  Brian: I've seen better.
  Peter: Brian, looks like somebody's checking you out.
  Brian: I'm-I'm not ready yet. You're getting some looks yourself.
  Peter: I'm not ready either.

Title: From Method to Madness

Theme Song
  Brian: Ah, thanks for coming, Lois. Mark's been trying to get me to see
  his one-man show for weeks.
  Lois: I think it's wonderful you're supporting your old pal.
  Mark: Go long, Eddie! Go long! Further! Further! [Playful groaning]
  Life sure was crazy growing up in Brooklyn. We had some real characters
  in my neighborhood, like Frank the Mailman. 'Hey, Mark, the ants for
  your ant farm came today!' And my friend Lonny, that knucklehead. 'Yo,
  Marky, let's play some b-ball.' 'B-ball.' That's what we called it.
  B-ball. And my grandma. Boy! Was she something else! 'Hey, Marky, don't
  forget to take your cod liver oil.'
  [Muffled coughing]
  [Chattering]
  Brian: God, what a piece of self-indulgent crap! All the characters
  sounded exactly the same.
  Frank the Mailman: Great show, Mark.
  Lonny: You really captured me perfectly.
  Mark's Grandma: Me, too, Marky. You are so talented.
  Brian: That was awful. You know, with a little practice, I could act
  circles around that guy.
  Lois: Oh, yeah? Well then, put up or shut up.
  Brian: <reading> "This Thursday, auditions for the Quahog
  School of Performing Arts' upcoming semester."
  Lois: You should try out.
  Brian: You know, that's not a bad idea, Lois. Okay, ready for the best
  acting you've seen all night? Mark, wow! What a journey! Thank you so
  much. Those three-and-a-half hours just flew by.
  Peter: Hey, Santos, Pasqual. Listen, you guys have done such good work
  today I got a surprise for you. Doritos! Not now. Later.
  Pasqual: [in Portuguese] I'm going to try and get on that "Millionaire"
  show.
  Santos: [in Portuguese] Fantastic! I will be your line for life!
  Pasqual: [in Portuguese] It's "life-line"! Dammit, those are the kinds
  of mistakes we can't afford to make!
  Dave: Help! Help!
  Peter: Oh, my God!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Dave: Thanks. I was boogie-boarding and I got sucked out by the rip
  tide. I thought I was a dead man.
  Peter: Oh, you've got to be starving. Here, eat these.
  Santos: [in Portuguese] Hey! He's giving away our Doritos!
  Pasqual: [in Portuguese] In Portugal, I was a cardiologist.
  Lois: Oh, my God! He was just floating out there by himself?
  Peter: Yep. He was so grateful I saved his life he invited us all over
  for dinner tonight.
  Lois: Oh, good. I don't have to cook.
  Peter: Oh, no, no-go ahead and cook anyway, Lois, and we'll throw it
  out. I don't want you to get rusty.
  Brian: Say, Peter, my audition's coming up. Would you mind listening to
  my monologue?
  Peter: Sure, buddy. Let's hear it.
  Brian: [breathes deeply] "Julie, there's something I gotta tell you..."
  Peter: Ha! That's awesome! Go on.
  Brian: "...tell you. I saw Doctor Phil..."
  Peter: Wow! Wow! Yes! Yes! I love it!
  Brian: "...Doctor Philips today. I might not make it to Christmas."
  Peter: Oh, yeah, drop the bomb. Drop it. There's not a dry eye in the
  house. Keep going.
  Brian: No, you know what? I'm gonna stop. Maybe we'll work on it later.
  Peter: Okay, well, just so you know, it was good. But I was also being
  pretty generous.
  [Rings doorbell]
  Peter: Well, look at you, you little jaybird. You want to tell your
  mommy and daddy the Griffins are here?
  Dave: Come on in! Welcome, Griffins!
  Lois: [stammering] We must be early.
  Dotty: Oh, nonsense. You're right on time.
  Peter: Oh, my God! She's got hair growing out of her boobs and up to
  her head!
  Lois: You're, uh, you're completely...
  Dotty: Nude? Yes. We're nudists.
  Chris: Permission to freak out?
  Lois: Peter, did you know about this?
  Peter: I thought he lost his bathing suit in the ocean.
  Dotty: So, you're the man who saved my husband's life. Dotty Campbell.
  Oh, what am I doing? Come here!
  Peter: Watch my hands, Lois! See where they are? No touchie!
  Dave: This is the back yard. Feel that? That's premium blue-tip
  Bermuda. Real hardy, but soft.
  Lois: Oh, good lord!
  Peter: Don't look directly into it, Lois.
  Dotty: The hot dogs and burgers are ready. Can I get you a beer, Peter?
  Peter: What do you got?
  Dotty: I've got Busch. Oh, and Busch Light.
  [Door closes]
  Dave: Sounds like Jeff's home. Hey, sport! How'd you do?
  Jeff: I got first place, Dad.
  Dave: Way to go, champ! Jeff plays varsity tennis for Saint Genevieve
  High.
  Meg: Oh, cool.
  Jeff: Is this the biggest thing you've ever seen?
  Dave: Don't get too cocky. I had a big one like that when I was your
  age.
  Dotty: Oh, you were a showoff yourself, Dave. He brought it out on our
  first date.
  Peter: Lois, I'm scared. <drops hot dog beneath table>
  I'll get that.
  Dave: Hey!
  Peter: Oh, God! Oh, Dave, sorry! Oh, God.
  Chris: Boobies!
  Lois: Chris, that's enough. I'm sure glad to be out of there!
  Peter: You said it. What those people are doing just ain't natural!
  Chris: Boobies!
  Lois: Did you hear me, young man?
  Meg: I don't know what the big deal was. I thought they were nice.
  Chris: Boobies!
  Lois: Peter?
  Peter: Do it.
  Lois: Did you have fun at the circus today?
  Chris: Elephants are bigger in person.
  Stewie: Break a leg up there, Brian.
  Brian: Well, you seem awfully enthusiastic.
  Stewie: At first I wanted you to fail. But then I realized you'd be out
  of the house five days a week, which means I'd be free to throw some of
  my sexy parties.
  [Madcap instrumental music] [All giggling]
  Simon: Brian Griffin?
  Stewie: Good luck, Brian.
  Brian: Hi, I'm Brian Griffin. This is from John Waltz's 'Leaving
  Wichita.' "Julie, there's something I gotta tell you. I saw Doctor
  Philips today. I might not make it to Christmas."
  Simon: Ooh, thank you. Next.
  Stewie: Next? Hold on, Brian! Stay up there! Stay there. Now, see here!
  Brian Griffin is a brilliant actor with talent and passion! But you
  alleged experts obviously didn't notice. Well, I did notice! I saw a
  man bare his soul up here! And his pain ran through my heart like an
  errant locomotive, but it was wasted, wasted on all of you!
  Simon: [Murmuring] Well, it looks like we're going to have to
  reconsider. Brian, we want you...
  Brian: Yes!
  Simon: ...off the stage. But your young friend there would make a
  perfect addition to the school's Rising Star Program.
  Stewie: Well, splendid! This calls for a sexy party!
  [Madcap instrumental music] [All giggling]
  Simon: Okay, funcakes, let's do a scene. Okay, Stewie, how about you
  and...uh, let's see, one of our veterans. Olivia.
  Olivia: I'm not doing a scene with him! He's inexperienced! He'll drag
  my whole performance down!
  Stewie: Are you serious? Is she serious?
  Simon: Okay, Stewie, I'll give you a solo exercise. Now, you're gonna
  do a little exercise we call, "The Life Cycle." Now, Without using
  words, you're gonna act out your entire life from birth to death
  exactly as I describe it. Okay, ready? Lie down. Now, you're being
  born. Ready, and burst through the placenta! Now fast-forward. It's
  your first day of school. You're alone and scared. But it's all right,
  it's all right. It's sloppy-joe day. Okay, pull it back, pull it back.
  The lady touched the bun and she's not wearing gloves. Okay,
  fast-forward. You're a businessman and you manage a lot of people. And
  here comes Henderson and he lost the big account. You're mad. Madder.
  Madder! Come on. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! There it is. You got it. And
  fast-forward. You're an old man now. You're on your deathbed. Your son
  is there holding your hand. You tell him you accept his lifestyle and
  regret humiliating him at his only sister's wedding by introducing him
  as your "other daughter." And, scene. Okay, any comments?
  Olivia: You are the weakest link! Good-bye!
  [Laughter]
  Stewie: [Laughs] Oh, gosh! That's funny. That's really funny. Do you
  write your own material? Do you? Because that is so fresh. "You are the
  weakest link. Good-bye!" You know, I've never heard anyone make that
  joke before. You're the first. I've never heard anyone reference that
  outside the program before. Because, that's what she says on the show,
  right? "You are the weakest link. Good-bye!" And yet, you've taken that
  and used it out of context to insult me in this everyday situation.
  God, what a clever, smart girl you must be, to come up with that joke
  all by yourself. That's so fresh, too. Any Titanic jokes, you want to
  throw at me, as long as we're hitting these phenomena at the height of
  their popularity? Because I'm here. God, you're so funny.
  Jeff: Meg?
  Meg: Jeff? Wow, hey! What are you doing here?
  Jeff: They had a sale on Super Soakers! Check it out.
  Meg: [Giggling]
  Jeff: What the heck?
  Teen 1: Nudist!
  Teen 2: My dad's a tailor, you jerk!
  Meg: Gosh, that's awful!
  Jeff: Ah, that's all right. I'm used to it. Well, I better go. So, um,
  would you want to do something sometime?
  Jeff: Sure. That'd be great.
  Meg: Cool. I'll call you later.
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Old Neighbor: Holy moly! It must be my birthday!
  Stewie: [Ineffective blowing] [Farting noise] [Nervous laughter] Thank
  you. That was, 'Me Farting' by Chopin. Thank you very...
<outside>
Stewie: So, Olivia. Beautiful day.
Olivia: You're not gonna fart again, are you?
Stewie: Well, I'd love to stay and chat. But you're a total bitch.
Teacher: The quarterly review's tomorrow. Think all your kids will pass?
Simon: Well, I'll tell you who's not gonna pass. It starts with an "O"
  and rhymes with "Bolivia." Give up? Olivia.
  Teacher: Really?
  Simon: Oh, yes! She's such a little frosty box! She won't work with
  anybody. And Stewie Griffin is also on the fence. If he and Olivia
  don't deliver at their quarterly reviews I'll just goint to have to
  kick their cute little bottoms out of here.
  Olivia: Uh, this table is reserved for people with talent.
  Stewie: Stow the 'tude, queenie. You and I have a problem. Read it and
  weep.
  Olivia: "Doesn't work well with others"?
  Stewie: Yes. Mine's no better. I'll spare you the details, suffice it
  to say the phrase "garden variety" appears a number of times.
  Olivia: What am I going to do?
  Stewie: What are 'we' going to do? Look, our evaluation's tomorrow. You
  need someone to work with and, well, I need someone to make me look
  good.
  Olivia: I don't know.
  Stewie: Well, fine! Refuse my offer. Get booted out of this place and
  wind up like Linda Evans.
  Intercom: Linda Evans, we have a spill in Aisle 9. Linda Evans, spill
  in Aisle 9.
  Meg: Do you like yours with crust or without?
  Jeff: How do you like yours?
  Meg: Okay, let's both answer at the same time. One, two, three.
  Jeff: Without!
  Meg: Without!
  Jeff: Holy moly! That's eight things we have in common!
  Lois: Kids, we're home.
  Jeff: Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Griffin.
  Meg: You guys remember Jeff?
  Peter: Sure. Lois, I'm gonna borrow your Mace. <sprays self in
  eyes> That's better.
  Lois: Meg, did any of the neighbors see Jeff come over?
  Meg: Mom! Come on, Jeff. Let's go in the other room.
  Lois: Now, Meg, no need to get so testes... Testy! Nuts! I mean crap!
  Meg: You want to sit down?
  Peter: Wait a second! Don't sit down yet!
  Meg: Dad, what are you doing?
  Peter: I'm uh, keeping the couch fresh.
  Meg: Dad!
  Jeff: It's okay, Meg. I understand what's going on here. I'm gonna go.
  Peter: Oh, just step on these coasters on your way out. There we go,
  yeah. Don't step on the hot lava. The carpet is hot lava.
  Meg: I can't believe you guys!
  Peter: Meg, how could you bring that naked kid into our house?
  Meg: Because I like him! He remembers my name!
  Lois: Well, I'm sorry but we don't think you should see him anymore.
  Meg: [Sobbing]
  Lois: I hate the sound of her crying.
  Peter: You know what sounds even worse?
  [Screech of cellophane]
  Peter: Ah, listen to that. Don't you hate that? That is awful. I think
  it's easier on me 'cause I'm the one making the sound.
  Simon: Okay, nice effort, Brad. But let's remember our performance
  hierarchy. Legitimate theater, musical theater, stand-up,
  ventriloquism, magic, mime. All right, next up is Olivia. Liv, what
  monologue are you doing for us this time?
  Olivia: I'm not doing a monologue. I'm doing a piece with Stewie.
  Simon: A duet. Really? Well, let's see it.
  Stewie:: A five, six, seven, eight ? Who's got the greatest gal around?
  ?
  Olivia: ? You do! ? ? Who's got the sweetest man in town? ?
  Stewie:: ? You do ?
  Olivia: ? Who's got a guy who makes her smile all day? ?
  Stewie:: By the way, I'm not so bad to look at either
  Olivia: ? Who's got a guy with lots of brains? ?
  Stewie:: ? You do ?? Who's got the girl who loves chow mein? ?
  Olivia: ? You do ?
  Stewie:: ? Who's got the greatest love in the world? ?
  Olivia: ? You do ?
  Stewie:: ? And you do ?
  Both: ? Thank goodness I've got you ?
  Olivia: ? Who's got a guy to tell her jokes? ?
  Stewie:: ? You do ?? Who's got a girl to show the folks? ?
  Olivia: ? You do ?
  Stewie:: ? Who's got a girl he'd like to one day undress? ?
  Olivia: ? Give it a rest, I told you not until we're married ?
  Stewie:: ? Who's got the gal with all the snazz? ?
  Olivia: ? You do ?? Who's got the fella with pizazz? ?
  Stewie:: ? You do ?? Who's got the greatest love in the world? ?
  Olivia: ? You do ?
  Stewie:: ? And you do ?
  Both: ? Thank goodness I've got you ?
  [Applause]
  Simon: Watch this. Are you watching? [slaps self in face] That's for me
  ever having doubted you. A-plus!
  Stewie: And that's for you wearing purple pants with blue socks!
  [Wincing] I totally called him on it.
  Simon: Okay, no secrets. I want to share Stewie and Olivia with the
  world.
  Lois: Well, they're awfully young. Is this really a good idea?
  Olivia's Mother: It's a great idea. I've always dreamed of becoming an
  actress. That's not why I'm pushing Olivia to do it. Is it suspicious
  that I brought that up unprovoked?
  Lois: Well, I guess it might be okay.
  Peter: Sure, look at Elroy Jetson. He was a child actor and he turned
  out just fine.
  Elroy: Do you know who I am? I'm Elroy Jetson!
  Bar Manager: Yeah, yeah, come back when you have some money. Take him
  home, Bamm-Bamm.
  Bamm-Bamm: Bamm-bamm-bamm!
  Elroy: I don't want to go home! Take me to Astro's grave!
  Olivia: ? You do ?
  Stewie:: ? And you do ?
  Both: ? Thank goodness I've got you ?
  [Applause] [Laughing]
  Olivia: Do you hear that! They love us!
  Stewie: Yes, we're a hit! You were amazing!
  Olivia: Oh, so were you!
  Stewie: It was a good crowd. They didn't even notice that you missed
  that F-sharp!
  Olivia: Yes. Well...beg pardon?
  Stewie: The F-sharp, darling. You were just slightly off.
  Olivia: I'm pretty sure I wasn't!
  Stewie: Oh, well, maybe it was me.
  Olivia: Must've been you.
  Stewie: I was being sarcastic.
  Olivia: Well, it wasn't me!
  Stewie: Well, it wasn't me!
  Stewie & Olivia: [Singing single notes]
  Stewie: Like this, listen to me!
  Lois: Oh, hi, Meg.
  [Meg slams door and silently goes upstairs]
  Lois: Peter, Do you think maybe it was unfair to tell Meg she couldn't
  see that boy?
  Peter: Oh, completely. We totally reamed her. Did you see that look in
  her eyes? She hates you.
  Stewie & Olivia: [Singing single notes]
  Simon: Well, there it is, kids. Your first marquee. Meet you inside.
  Olivia: Pretty exciting.
  Stewie: What? The marquee or the other thing?
  Olivia: What other thing?
  Stewie: You know. The sex. With Simon. Why else would your name be
  first?
  Olivia: Well, it's obvious. You know, lead with strength. Put your best
  foot forward, et cetera, et cetera.
  Stewie: So, the sex was good?
  Olivia: Oh, shut up, you egotistical jerk!
  Stewie: You shut up, you sap-bellied strumpet!
  Olivia: Blimp-headed jackass!
  Stewie: Mealy-mouthed crotch pheasant!
  Stewie & Olivia: ? Thank goodness I've got you ?
  Meg: Jeff? What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to see you.
  Jeff: Your parents invited me.
  Meg: My parents? But they wouldn't...
  Lois: Yes, we would.
  Meg: Oh, my God! What are you doing?
  Lois: We were wrong, Meg. If you like Jeff, we should give him a chance.
  Peter: Yeah. We wanted him to feel welcome in our home.
  Chris: Mom, I need new batteries for my Walkman. Hey, why is everybody
  else naked?
  Peter: Yahtzee! I win! Yeah! In your face! In your face! In your face!
  Meg: [Screaming]
  Jeff: I gotta get going. Thanks, Mr. And Mrs. Griffin.
  Lois: Our pleasure, Jeff.
  Peter: Nice hanging with you, Jeff.
  Meg: I'm sorry about my parents. I hope they didn't embarrass you.
  Jeff: Are you kidding? I think they're great! It took a lot of guts for
  them to do what they did. I'll see you later.
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Meg: Thanks, you guys. That was really cool.
  Quagmire: Peter. Can I borrow your lawnmower? You folks got a towel?
  Olivia: Would you be a dear and ask Stewie to dance on his own feet
  tonight?
  Stewie: Pardon me, Simon, could you provide Olivia with a bucket so she
  can carry a tune?
  Simon: People! People! Stop this craziness! The critic from the
  Providence Journal is here. If he gives us a good review, the doors are
  gonna fly open! Now, go get 'em, my little sillybillies!
  Stewie: All right, let's just get through this.
  Olivia: Fine with me.
  Stewie: Wait a minute. You're wearing ruby lipstick. You're painted up
  like some attention-grabbing Jezebel!
  Olivia: Well, you're one to talk! You've been stuffing your diaper
  since day one!
  Stewie: It's where I keep my peppermint Mentos! Just because your
  breath reeks of rotten Lunchables doesn't mean mine has to.
  [Oriental instrumental music]
  Simon: Break it up! Break it up!
  Olivia: I don't need this act, and I don't need you! You've done
  nothing but hold me back! I quit!
  Stewie: The only thing I've held you back from is failure! Come on,
  Simon. We don't need that little Bebe No-worth!
  Simon: I don't know, Stewie. Without Olivia this act is like Fire
  Island after Labor Day. Over!
  Stewie: Fine! I don't need you! I can manage my own career!
  [Stammering] Yes, I'm quite capable of that.
  Stewie: ?I've got my top hat and cane and a pocketful of miracles?
  ?Pocketful of miracles, Pocketful of miracles?
  [Booing]
  Man 1: You suck!
  Man 2: Somebody get a hook!
  Man 3: This is worse than Seussical!
  Stewie: No, wait, wait! I was about to do this thing. [does the
  vaudeville running in place routine]
  [Curtain lowering]
  Stewie: Oh, hello. Didn't notice you there. It's not easy living with
  my family. A bunch of characters they are. Like my father: 'Holy crap,
  Lois! Check out the freakin' log in the toilet!'
  Elroy: Get off the stage!
  Stewie: What do you say, Bernie? Two nights at the old rate?
  Retirement Home Manager: Like I told you before, kid, I can't book you
  without Olivia.
  Stewie: But that's the good news. We're back together. She's right
  here. <holds up ventriloquist dummy of Olivia>
  Olivia doll:"Hi, Bernie. Glad to be back. Ask Stewie about his sexy
  parties."
  [Manager slams door on Stewie]
  Stewie: "Ask Stewie about his sexy parties." What were you thinking?
  Olivia doll: I was just trying...
  Stewie: I'm not speaking to you.
  Olivia doll: But, Stewie...
  Stewie: Shut up!
  [Stewie is talking to his dolls, clearly having a nervous breakdown]
  Stewie: I guess the best advice I got was from Marty Scorsese. I was
  having a problem understanding why I'd be taking abuse from this
  lower-ranking officer played by Chris O'Donnell. And he told me, "You
  don't have to understand it. Your character does." Oh, that always
  stuck with me.
  Olivia: Stewie?
  Stewie: Olivia, what are you doing here? I must be an absolute mess.
  The studio made me fire my make-up girl.
  Olivia: Oh, I just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing. I had
  heard some things.
  Stewie: That it's going great for me? Well, you heard right!
  Olivia: Glad to hear that.
  Stewie: But, hey, you know, if you're not busy, um, what say you and I
  get the old team back together?
  Olivia: Well, actually, I can't. I'm on my way to Hollywood. I got this
  part in a movie, and...
  Stewie: [Stammering] What am I thinking? I'd love to. But I'm booked
  solid. I'm doing a three-episode guest shot on 'The Gilmore Girls.' I'm
  playing Rory's motorcycle-driving boyfriend. He's a bad boy at heart,
  but there's some good in there, Olivia. And it comes through,
  absolutely.
  Olivia: That's really good to hear, Stewie. Please, take care of
  yourself.
  [Sentimental instrumental music]
  Stewie: See you on the coast!
  Limo Driver: So, did you let him have it?
  Olivia: No. He let himself have it.
  Orderly: This is it.
  Brian: Hey, uh, how're you doing, kid?
  Stewie: Are you from Wardrobe?
  Brian: No, it's me, Brian. I brought what you wanted. But they wouldn't
  let me leave it. So...
  Stewie: Hit it once, please. Just once.
  [Tuning fork vibrating]
  Stewie: [Sings note] Oh, my God! I was flat. All right, then. Help me
  up. Let's go home.
  [closing theme music]



Title: Stuck Together Torn Apart

Theme Music
  Peter: Gosh, some of this stuff, you wonder who would ever need it in
  bulk. I mean, like watermelons.
  [Gallagher is seen buying a 12-pack of watermelons]
  Peter: Touché, CostMart.
  Lois: Brian, will you watch Stewie for a minute?
  Brian: Sure.
  Lois: And please keep a close eye on him. Remember what happened last
  time.
  [flashback to bedroom]
  Brian: Stewie, get down before you hurt yourself.
  Stewie: Shut up! You're not my mother!
  Brian: Good God! Are you all right?
  Stewie: Fine. Why do you ask?
  [back at CostMart]
  Peter: Mmm, delicious. I will seriously consider purchasing this
  product.
  Peter 2: What have we here? May I partake? [Exclaiming approvingly]
  Samurai Peter: Ah, Sausage-san. Plan to buy great amount for samurai
  buddies.
  Clerk: Sir, you don't have to keep moving to the back of the line. You
  can have as many as you want. They're free.
  Samurai Peter: What are you talking about?
  Peter: Can I have some more sausage?
  Peter 2: Yeah. Me too?
  Lois: Ooh, they got a great deal on pianos if you buy a four-pack. Meg,
  help me get these down.
  Ross: Lois?
  Lois: Oh, my God! <piano crushes Meg> I can't believe
  this. Ross Fishman, is that really you? I haven't seen you since
  college. How are you?
  Ross: Great, great. Wow, Lois! You haven't aged a bit.
  Lois: Oh, thank you. This 12-pack of fungicide is for my daughter, Meg.
  Meg: Help me.
  [Gallagher crushes melon on Meg's head; all laugh]
  Man 1: He's funny.
  Man 2: That was great.
  Man 3: Is it 1981?
  Stewie: Ah, yes, there you are! You people at the Industrial Adhesives
  Corporation certainly know how to make a tasty glue. Well then, let the
  banquet begin!
  Brian: Whoa, whoa, what the hell are you doing? Don't eat that.
  Stewie: Oh, for God's sake! Don't be such a nerd!
  Brian: Look, I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. If Lois sees this,
  she'll kill me.
  Stewie: You can let go of my hand now.
  Brian: You can let go of mine.
  [Both grunting] [Panting] [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Brian: Oh...
  Stewie: ...crap!
  Lois: Ross, I can't tell you how wonderful it's been to see you. It's a
  crime that it's been so long. We were so close.
  Ross: Maybe we could get together for a cup of coffee, catch up.
  Lois: Well...I don't know, Ross. I'm married now.
  Ross: Well, so am I. Does that mean we can't stay in touch with old
  friends? Tell you what. If you change your mind, here's my card.
  Chris: Hey, look, Dad! They have 12-packs of kidneys!
  Peter: Yeah, but you got to buy the cooler, too. That's how they get
  you.
  Brian: Okay, thanks.
  Stewie: Well?
  Brian: The good news is the same company makes a solvent that'll get us
  unstuck. The bad news is it takes two weeks for delivery.
  Stewie: You're telling me that we're stuck like this for a bloody
  fortnight?
  Brian: You cannot tell Lois about this.
  Stewie: Oh, and what if I do?
  Brian: I'll show her the pictures of you wearing her wedding dress.
  Stewie: You said there was no film in that camera!
  Lois: Come on, Stewie. Time to change your diaper.
  Brian: Mind if I watch?
  Lois: And I'm just ashamed of myself that I let Peter's jealousy
  prevent me from rekindling an old friendship just because it was with a
  man.
  Brian: Yeah, Peter's not exactly the most understanding guy with you
  and other men. Like that time at the movies?
  Hugh Grant: [Stammering] My, this is terribly awkward. But I wanted to
  tell you something. But I don't know. I seem to be so charmingly
  befuddled.
  Lois: Oh, that Hugh Grant is so handsome.
  Peter: Oh, is that how it is? Come here, you home-wrecking bastard!
  Chris: Don't do it, Dad! He's bigger than you!
  Brian: And when you went to that concert?
  Singer: Thank you, thank you very much. This next one is for all the
  ladies out there.
  [Women screaming]
  Brian: And then there was last Saturday night.
  Lois: Look at that handsome man.
  Peter: You son of a bitch! [punches mirror]
  Lois: I can't let Peter's irrational emotions run my life! I'll call
  Ross and see if it's not too late to take him up on his offer. Would
  you mind finishing up?
  Brian: Uh, sure.
  Stewie: Yes, yes, do you like cleaning my doodie, Brian? Say it. Say,
  "I like cleaning your doodie, Stewie." Ha! Don't forget the taint.
  [Magnum, pi music and titles on TV]
  Magnum: TC, you fly the chopper around the island. I'll go talk to the
  beautiful women. And Tattoo here will keep an eye out for the
  kidnappers.
  Higgins: Higgins.
  Magnum: We'll need to have security unlock the gate for me out front.
  Okay, Tattoo?
  Higgins: It's Higgins.
  Magnum: What?
  Higgins: The name is Higgins.
  Magnum: What's your name?
  Higgins: Tattoo!
  Lois: Oh, um, Peter, I'm just gonna go out for a few hours. So, I'll
  return in a few hours.
  Peter: Yeah, I'll do it when this is over. Hey, Lois, can you grab me a
  beer? Lois?
  Chris: Dad, I think she went out.
  Peter: All right. Then you be Lois.
  Chris: Okay.
  Peter: Hey, Lois, can you grab me a be-oh, my God! You've really let
  yourself go!
  Chris: Well, maybe if you bought me some nice clothes once in a while!
  [Siren wailing]
  Joe: Peter Griffin, we know you're in there! Come out with your hands
  up!
  Cleveland: Fooled you!
  [All laughing]
  Peter: Yeah, you sure did. What the hell is this?
  Joe: It's the new police surveillance van. We're going on a beer run.
  Want to join us?
  Peter: Nah, I quit drinking. I think I might be an alcoholic.
  Cleveland: What?
  Joe: Oh, my God!
  Quagmire:: Oh, man!
  Peter: Fooled you! Come on, let's go drink till we can't feel feelings
  any more.
  Joe: This van has the latest in law-enforcement technology. Watch.
  Van: Suspect! Suspect! You have the right to remain silent!
  Peter: Sweet.
  Cleveland: Hey, let me try.
  Joe: Cleveland, don't!
  Van: Minority suspect! Minority suspect! Danger, he's got a gun!
  Cleveland: [shouting]
  Quagmire:: Oh, no, the van's gone!
  Joe: No, no, it's got a cloaking device that disguises it as two
  homeless guys fighting over a wedge of cheese.
  Quagmire: Hey, Peter, isn't that Lois over there in that diner?
  Peter: What would Lois be doing at a diner? I already ate.
  Joe: Take a look.
  Peter: Oh, my God! That is Lois! Why the hell would she... Whoa! I can
  see your skin cells!
  Cell 1: I saw you on the cover of Scientific American. You looked great.
  Cell 2: Oh, please! Where my eyes are half-closed?
  Cell 1: God! Just take the damn compliment.
  Peter: What the hell is Lois doing with another man?
  Quagmire: Is it possible she's a whore? You know, just on weekends to
  help pay for her mom's dialysis? As in my fantasy? You know what? Let's
  just start over. Hi, I'm Quagmire.
  Peter: I wish I knew what she was saying.
  Joe: I think I can help.
  Lois: Your wife and children are beautiful. It's so good to catch up,
  Ross. I'm glad I called.
  Ross: I'm glad you did, too. Was your husband okay with you coming here?
  Lois: Uh, yes, he turned out to be just fine with it.
  Joe: All right. Let's see what we can pick up.
  Mort Goldman: Please don't spit in my eggs. Please don't spit in my
  eggs. "Thank you for the eggs!" God, I hope he didn't spit in my eggs!
  Waiter:: Hey, Doug. I just spit in that guy's eggs.
  Rat: Our armies are ready. Soon it will be time to leave the sewers and
  strike back at the humans in the overworld.
  Lois: I'm glad we both found someone to make us happy. I really enjoy
  being with you, Ross. I'm having a great time.
  Peter: Oh, my God! That's who that is. Ross Fishman, Lois's old
  boyfriend.
  Joe: I think we're losing them.
  Peter: Wait! I got to hear more!
  Joe: Peter, the power's not supposed to go that high!
  Quagmire: Damn, this itches! I wonder who gave it to me. Probably that
  skank who needed a ride to the gas station! Last time I do somebody a
  favor! Oh, God! They must have heard me! Oh, God! I can hear me! [hums
  ('The Stars and Stripes Forever'?) ]
  [Moist noises]
  Stewie: [Exclaiming] What the hell do you think you're doing?
  Brian: I'm cleaning myself.
  Stewie: You were clean 15 minutes ago, now you're just on vacation.
  Peter: So, Lois is seeing old boyfriends, huh? Well, two can play at
  that game. I just gotta find my little black book. [Dramatic
  instrumental music] Ah, here it is.
  [outside house]
  Peter: Brenda?
  Brenda: Peter! Oh, my God! It's been 25 years!
  Peter: Yeah. I guess you're married now, huh?
  Brenda: Yeah. Ricky, you were right! I was pregnant!
  Peppermint Patty: What's up, Pete? Long time no see.
  Peter: Gosh, Patty! The years have been great to you.
  Peppermint Patty: Well, I owe that to my better half.
  Marcy: Who is it, sir?
  Peter: Angie?
  Angie: Peter? Oh, my God! Come in!
  [Eerie instrumental music]
  Peter: Uh, what is all this stuff?
  Angie: Peter, I have been waiting for this moment for 25 years! I
  haven't washed my hand since you last touched it.
  Peter: Oh, my God! That's disgusting!
  Angie: And look! Look! I left the toilet just as it was the night we
  went to prom. It's the little piece of you that's kept your memory
  alive. But now I have you back...
  [Peter flees]
  Angie: Oh, well. At least I still have you. You hungry?
  [Siren wailing]
  Brian: Oh, crap! All right. Let me handle this.
  Cop: You were going 65, fella. That's 10 miles over the...why are you
  holding that infant's hand?
  Stewie: We met on the Internet.
  Brian: Shut up!
  Stewie: Yes, he lured me down to the park with promises of candy and
  funny stories.
  Brian: Officer, you ever hear of that super industrial adhesive?
  Cop 2: Actually, yes, we have.
  Meg: Dad, how come you keep looking at the door?
  Peter: Oh, Meg. You and your drugs . [Doorbell rings]
  Peter: I wonder who that could be.
  Hooker: Peter Gifford?
  Peter: My God! Dora, my old girlfriend. What a surprise that you would
  want to look me up! You always thought I was so handsome.
  Lois: Peter, can I see you in the other room?
  Brian: Yeah, go. Say it.
  Stewie: Should I?
  Brian: Yeah.
  Stewie: I can't.
  Brian: Just say it.
  Stewie: Okay. How far can you get this banana...I can't say it. She's
  looking right at me.
  Lois: Peter, what the hell is this about?
  Peter: I'll tell you what it's about. It's about you and Ross Fishman!
  Lois: What?
  Peter: I saw you with him the other day breaking the fifth commandment!
  Congress passes these things for a reason, Lois!
  Lois: That's it! Peter, you're suffocating me with your jealousy. I
  can't take it anymore. I'm calling a marriage counselor. I can't even
  have coffee with a friend without you freaking out! What is your
  problem?
  Peter: You want to know what my problem is? You want to know what my
  problem is? I love too much!
  Lois: Peter, what are you talking about?
  Peter: Don't you see, Lois? We're alive!
  Lois: Peter, you're scaring me!
  Peter: Good! Embrace the fear! Dance with me, Lois! Dance the dance of
  life! <crashes into china cabinet> Yeah, maybe you should
  call that marriage counselor.
  Marriage Counselor: Mr. And Mrs. Griffin, I have reviewed your
  situation and I have a suggestion.
  Lois: We're willing to do whatever it takes.
  Marriage Counselor: I'd like to put video cameras in every room of your
  house so that I can observe your uncensored behavior.
  Peter: Wow! Just like that show, Big Brother. Except somebody'll be
  watching.
  Marriage Counselor: All right. I've looked through all the video
  footage. I've compiled what I believe to be an accurate cross-section
  of your home life. Here are the results.
  Lois: Peter, give Chris a spanking.
  Peter: Okay. Chris, I'm watching the game. You know what to do.
  Chris: [Shouting] This hurts me more than it hurts you.
  Lois: [reading aloud] "Dear Diary, Kevin is so hot. Today he was out in
  the yard raking leaves. God, I wish he'd throw me into that pile of
  leaves!"
  [All laughing]
  Meg: Hey, what's everybody... Oh, my God! My diary! I hate you all!
  [Meg wailing]
  Peter: Keep going.
  [Peter and Chris in grass skirts]
  Peter: No. It's step-hip-step-pivot. Are you trying to piss off the
  volcano?
  Stewie: Get my back, would you? Oh, that's it. Ooo, that feels good.
  Peter: Hey, Lois, can you give me a hand with this jar?
  Lois: Oh, For heaven's sake, Peter! [Bees swarm from jar] [Lois
  screaming]
  Peter: Gotcha!
  Marriage Counselor: To be honest, I've never seen such dysfunction. Mr.
  and Mrs. Griffin, what I'm about to suggest may seem unorthodox. I
  recommend a trial separation, during which time I advise that you date
  other people. I believe this will help you gather perspective on your
  marriage.
  Lois: Date other people?
  Peter: Oh, my God!
  Marriage Counselor: I realize this is very upsetting for you. That's
  why I've invited Howie Mandell to lighten the mood by blowing up a
  surgical glove with his nose.
  [Howie Mandel enters and does his surgical glove routine, then passes
  out, cuts his head on the table, and begins bleeding on the floor]
  Peter: [Laughing]
  Peter: Boy, this feels really weird, Lois.
  Lois: I know. But maybe the doctor's right. This time apart could be
  good for us.
  Peter: I don't know, Lois. Splitting up didn't work too well for
  Pac-Man and his wife.
  Red Ghost: Hey, c'mon, buddy. Forget about her.
  Green Ghost: Yeah. You're too good for her anyway.
  Yellow Ghost: Cheer up, man.
  Red Ghost: Hey! You want to eat us? Huh? We're turning blue! We've got
  nowhere to run!
  Yellow Ghost: Oh, my God! He's gonna get us!
  Red Ghost: Yeah, he's not budging. Come on. Let's go to Q*Bert's.
  Peter: I really appreciate you putting me up, Cleveland.
  Cleveland: Our house is your house, Peter. I'd sit here and chat with
  you, but I need to get back upstairs to Loretta because it's our
  anniversary and the gettin's good.
  [Cleveland yelling in pain and loud banging]
  Cleveland: When is it gonna be my turn?
  Muriel Goldman: You are welcome to stay with us as long as you like.
  Peter: Thanks, Muriel. So, uh, what do you guys do for fun around here?
  Mort Goldman: We like to watch old movies while listening to Hotel
  California to see if it synchs up in a significant way. And so far, no.
  Nothing has.
  [Phone rings]
  Lois: Hello?
  Quagmire: Hey, Lois. Is Peter there?
  Lois: Hi, Quagmire. No, Peter's not home. We're, uh-we're having some
  minor marital problems. Our therapist has advised us to date other
  people.
  Quagmire: Hey, Lois, you want to go out?
  Lois: What? I don't know, Glen. Peter and I just separated. I feel like
  I need more time.
  Quagmire: How about now?
  Lois: We are supposed to see other people. I guess it's better to go
  out with you than some sex pervert.
  Quagmire: I'm in! [Jabbering excitedly]
  Stewie: God blast it! Would you hold it for five seconds? [Panting]
  Okay.
  Neil Goldman: So, Mr. Griffin, how does it feel to be a bachelor on the
  prowl once again?
  Peter: It's not as great as you might think. I just don't have the same
  way with women that I used to.
  Peter: That was nice. That was nice. I had a really great time with you
  today, beautiful stranger. What's your sign? [Laughing] Gross. I still
  think you're neat though.
  Mort Goldman: You should try a video dating service, Peter. That's how
  Muriel and I met.
  Muriel Goldman: Let me show you Mort's tape. He was so charming.
  Mort Goldman: Ah! Oh, my eyes! Could you please turn down that very
  bright light? It's burning my retinas. Ladies, I'm a very desperate
  man. My name is Mort and I live with my mother. And I have very low
  standards. <sneezes> Oh, God! There's blood in my mucus!
  [Fly buzzing]
  Stewie: What the hell is wrong with you?
  Brian: Hey, there's the mail! Finally. All right, it says it takes an
  hour for this solvent to take effect.
  Stewie: Well, let's see. What takes an hour? We could watch Rita Rudner
  do five minutes of stand-up.
  Brian: Ba-zing.
  Quagmire: Oh, boy! We're gonna have a swell time tonight, Lois.
  Lois: Glen, thank you for being such a good friend and looking after me
  like this.
  Quagmire: No problem. It's chilly out, so I brought you a jacket.
  Lois: No, thanks. I'll be fine.
  Quagmire: Please?
  Mort Goldman: Peter, Muriel and I both feel that you need to follow
  your therapist's advice and start dating.
  Peter: Aw, geez, Mort! I don't know if I'm ready.
  Mort Goldman: Come on, stud. We've got it all set up for you to go out
  with our niece. Honey, come on out here and meet Peter Griffin. Peter,
  this is our niece, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
  Jennifer Love Hewitt:: Nice to meet you.
  Peter: All right, I'm getting up. Hi. Peter Griffin. Where do you want
  to go? Anywhere except the disco. They don't let me in anymore.
  [Disco music playing]
  Peter: Crappy Mexicans and your glass candy!
  Brian: What's going on?
  Man: There's a little girl down in that well.
  Brian: Oh, my God!
  Man: Unfortunately, nobody's arms are long enough to reach her. Except
  that one guy. But he's helping that woman tickle a midget in a tree.
  Midget: Hee-hee-hee! Stop it!
  Stewie: Oh, God! You want to rescue her, don't you? It's times like
  this I wish they'd used me for stem-cell research.
  Girl: Help me!
  Stewie: It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
  Ha!
  Brian: All right, I'm gonna lower you in.
  Stewie: I just noticed. How often do you see a 17th century well in
  this day and age?
  Brian: Hurry up! The glue's wearing off!
  Brian: All right! All right!
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Brian: We did it.
  Stewie: Job well done.
  Brian: And, we're not stuck together any more.
  Stewie: Thank God!
  Brian: You said it.
  Stewie: You want to hold hands on the walk home?
  Brian: Yeah, sure.
  Mother: Oh, Susie! Thank God you're all right! Wait a minute. This
  isn't my little girl.
  Midget: Hey, that was my wife!
  [Little people giggling]
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: I Know What You Did Last Summer?
  Peter: Never heard of it.
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: The Devil and Daniel Webster?
  Peter: Nope.
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: Party of Five?
  Peter: Was that a porno? Hey, hey, don't worry about it. Sometimes you
  gotta do a lot of crap before they put you in anything decent. Aw, the
  food here is fantastic. This is where I took Lois on our first date.
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: You ordered a pie for an appetizer?
  Peter: Oh, yeah, don't worry. I'll go to the john and fire one out in
  five minutes. That should make room for dinner.
  Waiter: Here's your table, Mr. Quagmire.
  Quagmire: Thanks. Hey, how about a couple of drinks?
  Waiter: Certainly, sir. Martini for you and the usual roofie colada for
  your date?
  Quagmire: No, no, no. I wouldn't bring...a glass of wine.
  Lois: Oh, my God! That's Jennifer Love Hewitt! Wow! I wonder who she's
  here with? She could date any man she wanted to.
  Peter: There. Made lots of room. Hey, waiter. That sign in the bathroom
  about washing your hands...that's only for the staff, right?
  Waiter: Uh, technically, yes.
  Peter: That's what I thought. Great. Oh, man! These all look good,
  every one of them. You want some bread?
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: No!
  Lois: Peter, is that you?
  Quagmire: Peter? Oh, no! I can't let him see me!
  Lois: It's okay, Quagmire. We're just doing what the therapist said we
  should do. Peter, I think it's great you're out with Jennifer Love
  Hewitt. Hi. I loved you in "Heartbreakers." You be on your best
  behavior.
  Peter: Here you go, sweetheart. Open up.
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: No!
  Peter: There you go. Isn't this romantic?
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: That's it! You have got to be the most vile,
  disgusting human being I've ever met! And I have never been more turned
  on in my life.
  Lois: Hold on, toots! I don't care what our therapist says. I won't
  stand by and watch my husband lock lips with another woman! Now, beat
  it!
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: What's your problem, Grandma?
  Lois: You are! And I only saw Heartbreakers on a plane! And the flight
  was delayed, so the headphones were free!
  Peter: Wow! That was pretty cool, Lois.
  Lois: Gosh! I guess I finally understand...
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: [screaming]
  Lois: Yeah, you better run, you little bitch! I guess I finally
  understand how you can get so jealous sometimes. Seeing her kiss you
  like that just made me crazy.
  Peter: Well, I guess we're just gonna have to learn to control our
  jealousy together.
  Lois: Together.
  Waiter: Ma'am, you dropped your napkin.
  Waitress: Here's your drink, sir.
  Peter: Ah, we'll work on it later. I love you, Lois.
  Lois: I love you, too, Peter.
  Jennifer Love Hewitt: What a couple of freaks! God, I need a drink!
  Quagmire: Waiter! Martini and a roofie colada!

Title: Road to Europe

[1950s movie music] [old Hope/Crosby Road movie-style titles]
  Stewie: I say! It's 4:00. Away with you!
  Meg: Stewie!
  Chris: Change it back!
  Brian: Forget it. Jolly Farm Revue is on. It's the latest
  indoctrinating pablum for children with not enough to do.
  Stewie: Hey! Shut up!
  Mother Maggie: Wakey-wakey, children.
  Children & Stewie: Good morning, Mother Maggie.
  Mother Maggie: The sun has risen on another day in Jolly Farm. Let's
  see what life's rich pageant has in store for us.
  Stewie: Oh, she has the voice of an angel! Not to mention a balcony you
  could do Shakespeare from.
  Mother Maggie: Play your song, Melody Sheep, to aid the little ones'
  nourishment. But play softly, for Pengrove Pig wishes to read aloud
  from his magic tome that holds every book ever written.
  Pengrove Pig: "These were difficult times for the children of Ipswich,
  when the lollipop famine cursed their pleasant village. "
  Brian: How can you stand watching this? It's dreck and you know it. Oh,
  don't have the guts to respond, huh? No intelligent defense of this
  unmitigated crap?
  Peter: Commercial! <punches Brian> I'm gonna get some
  graham crackers.
  Moderator: Welcome back to KISS Forum, Rhode Island Public Access' most
  popular show about KISS.
  Peter: Lois, hurry! It's back on!
  Lois: Calm down, Peter. You know I wouldn't miss a second of this.
  Moderator: Okay, let's take a call. You're on KISS Forum.
  Caller 1: KISS rules!
  Moderator: Okay, good call. Good call. All right. You're on KISS Forum.
  Caller 2: Yeah. KISS sucks!
  Moderator: Whoa!
  Peter: Trace the call! Trace the call!
  Caller 2: Yeah, they suck big time, man. They bite ass!
  Moderator: Wait a sec. I recognize that voice! Is this Dennis De Young,
  lead singer from Styx? Come clean, man.
  Caller 2: Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Dennis.
  Moderator: Dennis, you jealous douche, how about I crank a little
  'Detroit Rock City' and play 'Come Sail Away' and we can see how they
  stack up side by side? Huh? You want that, you high-voiced bastard?
  We'll be right back, after this.
  Paul Stanley: Hey! Didn't see you come in. We're getting into shape for
  our upcoming tour.
  Gene Simmons: We're playing five big shows in five days. So, if you...
  Ace Frehley: Rock and roll!
  Gene Simmons: Why, Why don't you just sit in the corner, huh? Go on. If
  you're a KISS fan, and you live in the Northeast come out for all five
  shows of what we're calling "KISS-Stock."
  Peter: Aw, Hell! The Northeast! It's times like this I curse the fact
  that we live in French Polynesia.
  Lois: No, Peter, we're in the Northeast.
  Peter: We are? And KISS is coming to the Northeast. That means...aw.
  Lois: That means-
  Peter: No, no, Lois! Don't help me! It means we can do something.
  Lois: Come on, Peter. You're almost there.
<Peter is at the dentist>
Peter: We can go to KISS-Stock!
Dentist: Owww!
Peter: Hey, yo, Lois!
Lois: What?
Peter: I'm packing for KISS-stock and I can't find my favorite
  underwear.
  Lois: You mean the pair with the rip in the right buttcheek from when
  you stepped on them pulling them up in that airplane bathroom from when
  you had the trots?
  Peter: No, the pair with the hole in the left buttcheek from when I
  held it in for two hours 'cause it was that extra long Palm Sunday
  church sermon and blowing gas would offend Jesus, so I let it go in the
  vestibule after Mass, and it sounded like Louis Armstrong?
  Lois: Oh, bottom drawer.
  Mother Maggie: Children, tell Mother Maggie what you want to be when
  you grow up.
  Child 1: A scientist.
  Child 2: A novelist.
  Child 3: A Cambridge don.
  Stewie: What's my future coming from these squalid surroundings?
  Getting into a fight at the Laundromat with some dude who hit on my
  baby's mama? I should be there, not here! <dreamy music>
  London.
  Chris: Hey, Dad? Can me and Meg stay up late every night when you're at
  KISS-Stock?
  Peter: You can do whatever you want, son. Just don't eat from the candy
  tree.
  Candy Tree: He's right to caution you. I feed on children.
  Brian: You don't mind watching Stewie for a few days, do you, Brian?
  Brian: Nah. Ever since Jolly Farm Revue came on, he's been pretty
  distracted. It'll be a breeze.
  Lois: Well, 'Bye, everyone.
  Meg: I can't believe my stupid parents are gonna spend five days
  following stupid old KISS around. It's painful.
  Peter: Not half as painful as a tire iron upside your head.
  Meg: What?
  Peter: I'll miss you.
  Brian: Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch?
<finds note from Stewie>
Stewie: <voiceover> Dear stupid dog, I've gone to live
  with the children on Jolly Farm. Good-bye forever, Stewie. P.S. I never
  got a chance to return that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. Um, I
  left the receipt on top of my bureau. I'm probably over the 30-day
  return limit but I'm sure if you make a fuss they'll at least give you
  a store credit or something. It's actually not a horrible sweater. It's
  just, I can't imagine when I would ever wear it , you know? I also left
  a button on the bureau. I'm not sure what it goes to but I can never
  bring myself to throw a button away. I know as soon as I do I'll find
  the garment it goes to, and then it'll.... Wait a minute. Actually,
  could it have been from the sweater? Did that sweater have buttons?
  Well, I should wrap this up before I start to ramble. Again, good-bye
  forever. P.P.S. You know, it might be a little chilly in London. I'm
  actually going to take the sweater.
  Brian: Oh, my God!
<Quahog Airport>
Stewie: One of these planes must be going to London.
British mother: Queue up, children. Spit spot. Here are the tickets,
  miss. These are all ours. Thank you.
  Stewie: Spit spot, Albert Hall, meat and two veg, Big Ben, Dave Clark
  Five, Spam and eggs, a baby's arm holding an apple, pip pip, cheerio.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
<Stewie boards plane, throwing a Nixon victory wave on the way
  on. Brian rushes through the airport, sneaking aboard the plane through
  the cargo hold>
  Flight Attendant: Hot towel?
  Stewie: Yes, thank you. <drops drawers> Well, come on!
<Brian grabs Stewie>
Stewie: What the hell are you doing here?
Brian: I'm taking you off this plane.
Stewie: Think again, Rover.
Brian: Great. I'm stuck on a trans-Atlantic flight with a petulant
  runaway. How could this get any worse?
  Andy Rooney: You know what I hate about flying? The peanuts. First of
  all, you can't get them open. Who are they trying to keep out of these
  things?
  Seinfeld: And what's the deal with the razor-blade slot in the
  bathroom? Are people actually shaving in there?
  Andy Dick: Hi, Andy Dick here. Excuse me. I've got to get my bag up in
  the overhead bin here. [Yelling and laughing] Wow, that's wacky!
  Stewie: There now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Did you sleep at all?
  Brian: Yeah, a little.
  Stewie: I couldn't sleep a wink-my pillow smelled like farts. But
  that's all right, because we're in England.
  Brian: Uh-oh.
  [Middle Eastern instrumental music]
  Stewie: Well, I don't get it. Where are England's verdant fields, its
  rosy-rumped maids, and buck-toothed solicitors?
  Brian: About 3,000 miles that way. We're in the Middle East.
  Stewie: Where are we going?
  Brian: I don't know. I'm not exactly familiar with this particular
  Arabian village.
  Vendor 1: Stuff for sale! Bad, cheaply made stuff for sale!
  Vendor 2: Hey, Americans. You like movies? I've got 'Dude, My Car Is
  Not Where I Parked It, But, Praise Allah, We Are Not Hurt.'
  Vendor 3: Camels for sale! This one owned by a little old man who only
  drove it to mosque on Sundays. Just had its knees replaced.
  Stewie: Great. Buy one and let's get out of here.
  Brian: What do you mean, buy one? All I've got is $50. We're gonna have
  to distract him. Follow my lead.
  Stewie & Brian: ? You and I are so awfully different ? ? Too
  awfully different, to ever be pals ?
  Stewie: Do you want to go first?
  Brian: Yeah, I'll go. ? Your favorite hero is the Marquis de Sade ?
  Stewie: Oh, you're one to talk. ? You get a stiffy from Phylicia Rashad
  ?
  Brian: Oh, one time
  Stewie: ? I'm a style flair, just look at my hip hair ?
  Brian: Oh yeah, thats quite a nice 'do there
  Stewie: Oh, thanks.
  Brian: <Triumph the Insult Comic Dog voice> For me to
  poop on!
  Stewie: What?
  Brian: Oh c'mon, you look like Charlie Brown.
  Stewie: Bite me, Snoopy
  Stewie & Brian: ? There's not, a whole lot, that we've got, to
  agree on ?
  Brian: 'Cause I love the strings of a classical score.
  Stewie: And I like that singer who looks like a whore.
  Brian: Ricky Martin?
  Stewie: Love him.
  Stewie & Brian: ? We're too different to ever be pals ?? You
  and I are ?
  Locals: ? Dododo ?
  Stewie & Brian: ? so awfully different ?
  Locals: ? Dododo ?
  Stewie & Brian: ? Too awfully different ?
  Locals: ? Dododo ?
  Stewie & Brian: ? to ever be pals ?
  Locals: ? Dododo dodo dodo doooo dodo ?
  Brian: ? Your head's as massive as a meteorite ?
  Stewie: Oh, very funny. ? You have a weenie like a christmas tree light
  ?
  Brian: ? I'd bet money, you'll marry a honey ? ? Whose pretty and funny
  ? ? And her name will be Ted ?
  Stewie: Oh a gay joke.
  Brian: I just work with what you give me.
  Stewie & Brian: ? You might think we're in sync ? ? But we
  stink, as a duo ?
  Brian: ? 'Cause you get a kick out of carnage and guts ?
  Stewie: ? And you get a kick out of stroking your... ?
  Brian: Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't say that on TV
  Stewie: What? Ego?
  Brian: Never mind.
  Stewie & Brian: ? We're too different to ever be pals ?
  Brian: Oh, man! We're screwed. We're lost in the desert, we have no
  food, no water, and our camel is dead from exhaustion.
  Stewie: And I had named him and given him a back-story. Chucky had the
  biggest hump of the camels in his village. And he was picked on for it.
  But then there was a terrible drought and Chucky went to the oasis,
  because he was like that. He drank and drank, and stored enough water
  in his massive hump to slake the thirst of the entire...
  Brian: Cut the maudlin crap. We're in trouble here. It's already below
  freezing, and it's getting colder. We're gonna die unless-unless we do
  something drastic.
  Stewie: What?
  Brian: We must slice open our camel's stomach and shelter ourselves in
  his entrails.
  Stewie: Eviscerate Chucky? I won't do it!
  Brian: Look, we're gonna die if we don't.
  Stewie: All right. <Brian slices open camel> Oh, God!
  It's like Orson Welles' autopsy.
  Brian: All right, just hold your breath and go. What are you doing?
  Stewie: Wiping my feet. I don't want to track any sand inside. Once you
  get it in there, you can't get it out. Oh God! I just threw up in his
  lung!
  Brian: Look, I know it's gross, but when you're desperate and you stare
  death in the face, you have no choice but to.... There's a Comfort Inn.
  Stewie: Really?
  Brian: Yeah. Good luck for us, huh?
  Stewie: You know, once you feng shui the organs, it's kind of cozy.
  [Loud heavy metal music]
  Lois: Oh, isn't this exciting?
  Man: Anyone got a light? Thanks.
  Lois: Peter, look, there's Dave and Dottie, the nudists.
  Dave: Well, hey there, Griffins!
  Lois: Dave, Dottie, what a pleasant surprise!
  Dottie: Don't tell me you're KISS freaks, too?
  Peter: KISS army soldier since 1977. How about you?
  Dave: '76. I don't think anyone knows more about KISS than I do.
  Peter: I'm sorry. What was that?
  Lois: It's not important.
  Peter: Let him answer, Lois!
  Dave: I said, no one knows more about KISS than I do.
  Dottie: Fellows, please keep it civil.
  Peter: I'm not sure I like the tone of your voice, Dave.
  Dave: Well, throw down, if that's what you want.
  Peter: Name Gene Simmons' special-effects mentor.
  Dave: Amazo the Magician. What high school did Paul Stanley go to?
  Peter: New York High School of Music. Paul and Gene's band before KISS?
  Dave: Wicked Lester. What year did KISS appear on the Jim Nabor's
  Halloween special?
  Peter: Trick question. It was Paul Lynde, and it was 1975. Now recite
  the ad that brought Peter Criss to Paul and Gene's attention.
  Peter & Dave: "Drummer willing to do anything to make it."
  Rolling Stone, October, 1972.
  Dave: Exemplary.
  Peter: Rock 'n' roll!
  Brian: How in the hell are we gonna get out of here?
  Stewie: Are you going to finish your red paste?
  Brian: No.
  Stewie: What about your sweet crusty thing?
  Brian: No, you can have it.
  Father: No more balloon for you. I am sick of you tooling around the
  village in it, honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s American rock
  music that we got here last week.
  Son: But, Father...
  Father: Go to your palace!
  Brian: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
  Stewie: Oh, yes. Just wait until they have to suffer through Jesus
  Jones. [Makes a disgusted sound]
  Brian: Not that, the balloon!
  Stewie: Oh, yes. The balloon. Let's take it.
  Brian: Wow! I didn't know it really looked like that.
  Stewie: Neither did I. <the landscape below the balloon looks
  like an actual map> Such lovely printing, too.
<at KISS-stock>
KISS: ?You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'?
Peter: Oh, Lois, here comes the best part.
KISS: ?I wanna rock and roll all night...?
Lois: "And have a wonderful time"
[Band stops playing]
Lois: Is that it? Oh, no no. "And something, something all day" Right?
Gene Simmons: Oh, man! I've lost all faith in mankind.
Paul Stanley: Music is dead to me now.
<Simmons and Stanley leave stage>
Peter Criss: Hey, now's our chance!
Ace Frehley: Let's do it!
<Criss and Frehley sing and dance to 'Chattanooga Choo
  Choo'>
  Stewie: I say! Where the hell are we?
  Cardinal: Pope! Pope! It's time to get up and put on your hat.
  Pope: It's a stupid hat!
  Cardinal: Pope!
  Pope: All right, okay. God!
  Cardinal: Pope, the floor is not a hamper!
  Pope: Man!
  Cardinal: Good. Now it's time to go on the balcony and address the
  people.
  Pope: [Speaking Latin] <the Pope is hit by the balloon and
  knocked onto a statue below> [Pope screaming]
  Brian: All right, all we've got to do is find the American Embassy and
  they'll help us get home.
  Stewie: Home? I have no intention of returning to that disgusting hovel
  with that intolerable woman, that fat slob, and that insufferable dog.
  Oh, you're right here, aren't you? Oh, well, I stand by it. My future
  is with Jolly Farm.
  Brian: You really think that, don't you?
  Stewie: I know it.
  Brian: Okay, we've got three days until Peter and Lois get back from
  their KISS concerts. Let's go to Jolly Farm.
  Stewie: Yeah, now you're talking!
  Pope: You make the Pope look like a fool! God will make you pay. Smite
  them! He's cooking something up.
  [Train whistle]
  Stewie: I say! Brian, look. Three rows down.
  Brian: What?
  Stewie: Is that Tom Bosley?
  Brian: What would Tom Bosley be doing on a train in Switzerland?
  Stewie: I'm almost certain. Tom! Did he look?
  Brian: I don't know.
  Stewie: If I yell, you have to watch. Tom Bosley!
  Brian: No, it's not him.
  Tour Guide: Besides its beautiful historic architecture Munich was the
  home of many great writers such as Thomas Mann. You will find more on
  Germany's contribution to the arts in the pamphlets we have provided.
  Brian: Yeah, about your pamphlet. Uh, I'm not seeing anything about
  German history between 1939 and 1945. There's just a big gap.
  Tour Guide: Everyone was on vacation! On your left is Munich's first
  city hall erected in 15...
  Brian: Wait, wait. What are you talking about? Germany invaded Poland
  in 1939 and...
  Tour Guide: We were invited! Punch was served! Check with Poland!
  Brian: You can't just ignore those years. Thomas Mann fled to America
  because of Nazism's stranglehold on Germany.
  Tour Guide: Nope. Nope. He left to manage a Dairy Queen.
  Brian: A Dairy Queen? That's preposterous.
  Tour Guide: I will hear no more insinuations about the German people!
  Nothing bad happened! [Yelling in German] <gives Nazi
  salute>
  Brian: Uh, is that a beer hall?
  Tour Guide: Oh, yes. Munich is renowned for its historic beer halls.
  Lois: Why is everybody glaring at us?
  Peter: Why, Lois? I'll tell you why. Your faux pas last night at the
  concert was so upsetting I had to call a university professor to tell
  me what phrase to use to describe it.
  Professor: Use "faux pas."
  Peter: Thanks, professor.
  Peter: You've been living a lie all these years. You represented
  yourself as a KISS fan. And why? To make me look foolish!
  Lois: No. To make you happy. I wanted to share in all aspects of your
  life, Peter. But I just was never that big a KISS fan.
  Peter: I should've guessed that when you were willing to dress up as
  Peter Criss. No one wants to be Peter Criss, Lois! Not even Peter Criss!
  Lois: I guess I'm just not as cool as you thought I was.
  Peter: I guess not.
<Amsterdam>
Brian: I'm exhausted. Come on. Let's get a coffee. <enters
  coffeehouse> The smoke is so acrid.
  Stewie: A man can hardly breathe in here.
  Pot Head: You should get some hash, man. You can't go wrong.
  Stewie: Not true. Ground meat can go very wrong for me very quickly,
  and everyone in this room will suffer the consequences!
  Pot Head: You are out there, man, in the ether.
  Stewie: I'd love to further pursue our palaver but I am not fluent in
  "freak up"! So, I'm just gonna turn back over here, back towards my
  table.
  Brian: Say, are you hungry?
  Stewie: Well, you know, I wasn't when I came in. But isn't that so
  funny? I'm getting there.
  Brian: Yeah. Same here.
  Stewie: I think the only reason we die is that...
  Brian: Dude, I know what you're gonna say. And I am so completely...
  Stewie: Wait, wait, wait! Sh, sh, sh. The only reason we die is because
  we accept it as an inevitability. Hah.
  Brian: Do you think I'll ever find the right woman?
  Stewie: Oh, God! Yes, man! Come on! Dude, you're great!
  Lois: Peter, are you ever gonna forgive me?
  Peter: Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you, so I will take my rage
  out on my own body. Let's go to Denny's.
<at Denny's>
Peter: Oh, man! I don't believe it! KISS is here! We don't deserve to
  be under the same roof with them. Let's go.
  Lois: All right. I guess I could fix us something when we...Chaim?
  Peter: Lois! Do not address KISS unless they address you first!
  Lois: Oh, my God! Chaim Witz? It is you.
  Gene Simmons: Which one do you want me to sign? Left or right?
  Lois: No, no, no. It's Lois. Lois Pewterschmidt. I knew you before you
  changed your name.
  Gene Simmons: Lois! I don't believe it. It's been ages. Hey, guys, this
  is the girl I told you about. You know, I knew her before we formed
  KISS. "Loose" Lois!
  Paul Stanley: Cool! "Loose" Lois!
  Peter Kriss: The legend herself.
  Ace Frehley: My Grand Slam was supposed to be with sausage.
  Lois: I never realized you were Gene Simmons the rock star!
  Gene Simmons: You look great, Lois. Anyone nailing you now?
  Lois: Yes, my husband nails me. This is him, Peter.
  Peter: You-are-gods!
  Gene Simmons: Yeah, thanks, right. We're recording some tracks in
  Boston next month. You should come on by.
  Lois: We'd love that, Chaim... I mean Gene, you big rock star. Bye!
  Wow! Such a small world. He was a nice boy. And he's still nice.
  Peter: Listen, Lois, what I said before...I've never been more wrong in
  my life. You are the coolest girl in the world! My wife did KISS!
  Lois: And J. Geils.
  Peter: What?
  Lois: Nothing.
  Stewie: There it is! The BBC! Well, this is it. I'll say good-bye to
  you now.
  Brian: Well, have a good life, Stewie.
  Stewie: Oh, I shall! Oh, hey, I meant to ask you did you find out what
  the button on my bureau was from?
  Brian: Oh, yeah. Chris' denim jacket.
  Stewie: Ah. I like that jacket. It looks good on him. Okay, then. So,
  we'll keep in touch?
  Brian: Sure.
  Stewie: Well, I have your address. See ya! There's Happy Hill!
  <crashes into set wall> What the deuce? Pengrove!
  Pengrove Pig! Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm! Oh, my! The
  magic tome. But it's cardboard. And there are no words. There are
  just.... What is it you've drawn here?
  Pengrove Pig: That's Oswald Owl slamming Mother Maggie in one of them
  Chinese baskets. <takes off pig head> Dead brill, eh?
  Stewie: Ah! Mother Maggie! Thank God! Something's terribly wrong.
  Mother Maggie: Whose stinky brat is this?
  Stewie: What? That's not your voice. Your voice is lyrical, like the
  gentle strum of a lute.
  Mother Maggie: Piss off, you grotty little wanker!
  Stewie: It's a fake. It's not real.
  Brian: I thought it'd be best for you to find out on your own, kid.
  Stewie: I feel like such a fool. Don't even look at me!
  Brian: Hey, come on. You want to get some ice cream? That'd make you
  feel better, right? You want to get some McDonald's? Do you want to
  take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes? Okay. Let's go take a dump in
  Mother Maggie's shoes.
  Meg: Jolly Farm is on, Stewie. Don't you want to watch?
  Stewie: The Stewie who loved Jolly Farm is dead, Megan. Meet the Stewie
  who loves funky fruit hats! [Humming tropical music]
  Meg: Turn it up! Mom and Dad are on!
  Moderator: We're back with more KISS Forum. I'm with the Griffins. They
  got something really exciting to share.
  Peter: Yeah. My wife here did KISS.
  Moderator: Get out of here!
  Lois: Hand to God.
  Moderator: Peter! How does that make you feel?
  Peter: I feel like I've done KISS, too, Donny. And it feels good.
  Moderator: Lois, you got any tips for the young girls in the audience
  tonight?
  Lois: Well, I guess the best advice I can give is that you never know
  who's gonna grow up to be famous. So, just make yourself available.
  Moderator: Cool. Cool. Well, that's our show for tonight. Now stay
  tuned for Battlestar Galactica Forum. <dons Cylon helmet>
  Welcome to Battlestar Galactica Forum.
  [Closing Theme music]



Title: Family Guy Viewer Mail 1

<Stewie and Brian in tuxes, sit in director's chairs backstage,
  next to a sack of mail>
  Brian: Hi, I'm Brian Griffin.
  Stewie: And I'm Stewart.
  Brian:: Many of you have written to the show with suggestions for
  episodes you'd like to see.
  Stewie: They're mostly God-awful.
  [presses button on box, producing very fake laughter]
  Brian:: Well, tonight we took your advice and produced three of our
  favorite suggestions.
  Stewie: Favorites? Oh, that's charitable.
  [Stewie again produces canned laughter]
  Brian: What is that?
  Stewie: I got this from 'Dharma and Greg'.
  Brian: I'm surprised there's anything left in it.
  BOTH: Whoa!
  Brian: Enjoy.
  Theme Song

<Title card: No Bones About It>
Announcer: And now back to The Newlywed Game.
Host: Carol, how did Nick answer the following: the last thing I would
  ever give my wife is 'blank'?"
  Wife: A little spending money?
  Host: I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Nick actually said "the antidote."
  Wife: Nick, what are you talking about?
  Lois: Oh, Meg, you were right.
<Peter opens beer bottle, producing a cloud of smoke>
Peter: Oh, my God! A genie!
Genie: I am here to grant you three wishes.
Lois: Peter, three wishes! Oh, this is so exciting!
Meg: I want a new hat!
Chris: I want a new hat!
Stewie: I want them to have new hats!
Lois: Kids, these are your father's wishes. Go ahead, honey. Get
  whatever you want.
  Peter: That's easy. I wish I could see what Kelly Ripa was like off the
  set.
  Genie: So it shall be.
  Regis Philbin: Great show today, Kelly.
  Kelly Ripa: Thanks, Reg. You, too.
<Kelly enters dressing room. A man is gagged and bound to a
  chair. Kelly reaches into his chest and rips his heart out, then pulls
  off her face, revealing a tentacled monster.>
  Regis Philbin: Kelly, Gelman needs us on stage for a couple of
  re-shoots.
  Kelly Ripa: Be right there, Reg. I just have to put on my face.
  Lois: My goodness! Did you see the size of that dressing room?
  Peter: Yes. They must really want to keep her.
  Genie: Your second wish?
  Peter: I got just the thing. I wish I had my own theme music.
  Genie: Done!
  Peter: I don't hear anything.
  Genie: Get up. Try it out.
  [Harp trill] [Piano chord] [Piano chord] [Cheerful instrumental music]
  Peter: Sweet.
  [Harp trill] [Orchestra crescendo] [Cheerful instrumental music]
  [Peter sees a bum] [Sentimental instrumental music]
  [Cheerful instrumental music]
  [Lois comes to bed in sexy lingerie] [Sexy instrumental music]
  Peter: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  [Cheerful instrumental music]
  [on a bus] Man: Hey, buddy, want to turn that stuff down?
  Peter: Come on, pal. That's classic traveling music. Try to enjoy it.
  Peter: ?Riding on a bus? ?Riding on a bus? ?Sitting next to bums?
  ?There's an open seat? ?Hope that isn't pee?
  Man: Yeah! I'm sick of hearing it!
  Peter: Look, I'm sorry, buddy. I can't turn it off.
  Man: Well, then I'm gonna break every bone in your body.
  Peter: I wish I had no bones!
  Genie: Done.
  [Peter dissolves into a boneless blob]
  Peter: That ought to show you!
  [Passengers screaming]
  Peter: Oh, no. I got to fart. But I don't know which way to lean.
  [house]
  Peter: I know you might be a little concerned about me not having bones
  and all. But I got to tell you, it's not that bad.
  Chris: Dad's just like Silly Putty. Look what I can do to Mary Worth's
  smug sense of self-satisfaction.
  Peter: That's right, son. Take her down a peg.
  Lois: Well, I guess we could all adjust to this.
  Stewie: Look! I'm making an angel!
  Peter: See, Lois? Everything's gonna be fine.
  Stewie: Now, smile while I write my name in you.
  [at the mall escalator; Peter gets sucked in at the bottom]
  Peter: Let go!
  [riding the teacups at Disneyland]
  Peter: [Peter laughing]
  [Peter is thrown free, and into a locker room. Michael Eisner picks up
  Peter, and uses him as a towel]
  Peter: [Peter screaming]
  Meg: But, Mom, I've got to use the bathroom now!
  Lois: I'm sorry, but your father gets incredibly filthy rolling around
  everywhere. (Peter is in the bathtub) (from outside) He just has to
  take his 12 baths a day.
  Chris: I don't like Dad anymore! I invited some friends over to jump on
  him like a trampoline but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe! And
  his mom yelled at him when he got home! And he beat me up at school the
  next day! It's all here in this pamphlet.
  Lois: Kids, we just have to learn to accept this. Like one of those
  stories on Dateline where a family member suffers a horrible accident
  and becomes a burden on everybody. Sure they pretend to be happy, but
  they're dead inside. They're dead. And that'll be our lives. Hmmm?
  Peter: What a big, boneless jerk I am! I might have screwed up my life
  but there's no reason I got to keep screwing up theirs. Good-bye,
  cruel, bone-filled world!
  [Peter releases the tub stopper, and is sucked down the drain]
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Peter: [yelling]
  Peter: Oh, so this is where all the waste and sewage winds up.
  [pull back to reveal Peter is below the 'HOLLYWOOD' sign]
  [men fighting on top of building; one falls off, only to land on Peter]
  Director: Cut and print. That's a wrap. Great job, Peter. Coming to the
  wrap party tonight?
  Peter: Gee, I don't know. I got a standup comedy class I'm taking at
  The Learning Annex. Actually, I won't be a standup comic, I'll be more
  like an amorphous-blob comic. I gotta write that one down!
  Director: Nonsense! I'll have the studio send a flatbed for you! See
  you at 8:00!
  [Peter looks at a picture of his family and sighs]
  [Soft piano music playing]
  Catharine Zeta-Jones: Peter, there's something I've been wanting to say
  to you all evening.
  Peter: What's that, Mrs. Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas?
  Catharine Zeta-Jones: I want to jump your non-bones.
  Peter: Jeez! I can't believe I'm your type.
  Catharine Zeta-Jones: Well, as you can tell from my husband, I've got a
  thing for saggy, shapeless men.
  Michael Douglas: I'm married to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Will you sleep
  with me?
  Peter: Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass. But Louie Anderson's eating the
  decorative soaps in the bathroom. Why don't you try him?
  'Doctor:': Excuse me. Aren't you Peter, the human stunt bag?
  Peter: That all depends on who's asking.
  Doctor: I'm a doctor, conducting an experimental procedure to give
  bones to a jellyfish. I'd like to try it on a human first. Interested?
  Peter: I don't know.
  Doctor: Interested?
  Peter: Did you just say that?
  Doctor: Yes.
  Peter: I'll do it!
  Doctor: Well, Peter, the operation was a complete success! What are you
  going to do now?
  Peter: The whole reason I had the operation was so I could go back to
  my family. But it's been so long. What if they don't love me anymore?
  Doctor: Peter, where do you think all those bones came from?
  Lois: Surprise!
  [Cut to the Griffins, all of whom are mis-shapen]
  Peter: My God! You mean, it's your bones that are inside me?
  Stewie: Well, mostly. We picked up a drifter to fill in the torso.
  Lois: Well, like I always say, a family of freaks is better than no
  family at all!
  Peter: Let's go home. You know what's really weird? This was covered by
  my HMO.
  
<Title card: Supergriffins>
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[truck marked 'Toxic Waste' drives down the streets of Quahog]
Trucker 1: Hey, Terry, you dare me to pop a wheelie in this thing?
Trucker 2: That doesn't sound safe at all, but, okay, I dare you.
[truck pops a wheelie; tanker comes off the back]
Trucker 2 Wow! That was great!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[loose tanker lands in the Griffin's front yard]
The Count:Six! Six bats! Seven! Seven bats!
Peter: Hey, is the Count a vampire?
Brian: What's that?
Peter: Well, he's got those big fangs. Have they ever shown him doing
  somebody in and then feeding on him?
  Brian: You're asking if they've ever done a Sesame Street in which the
  Count kills somebody and then sucks their blood for sustenance.
  Peter: Yeah.
  Brian: No, they've never done that.
  Lois: Everybody come quick! There's something in the yard!
  Meg: It looks like the back of a tanker truck.
  Peter: Wow! What do you think's inside?
  Chris: Maybe it's candy!
  Lois: Chris, no!
  Peter: Lois, Lois, let him dream.
  [Chris pulls loose plug from the tanker, splashing the family with
  waste]
  Meg: What is this stuff?
  Brian: It's some kind of nuclear waste.
  Stewie: Tell me, does anyone else feel a trifle queasy?
  [Stewie's head swells up; family screams in horror]
  Stewie: What? Do I have a boogie? I say, it appears my cranium has
  doubled in size! How delightful! This toxic stew seems to have given me
  telekinetic abilities.
  Chris: Hey, I can make fire!
  Peter: Chris, come here a second. This is gonna be hilarious. Okay, on
  the count of three. One, two, three.
  [Peter farts, and Chris lights it]
  Stewie: Do it again!
  Lois: All right, everyone. Clearly, something very strange has happened
  here. We each seem to have acquired superpowers from that nuclear
  waste. We've been given a gift. And whether that gift is Chris' fire
  conjuring, Stewie's telekinesis, Brian's super-speed...
  Brian: Ask how the Queen of England is.
  Lois: How's the Queen...
  [Brian zips out, then reappears wearing a Beefeater's hat]
  Brian: She's great.
  Lois: Peter's morphing ability...
  Peter: Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll.
  Lois: ...my super strength, or Meg's super-amazing ability to grow her
  fingernails...
  Meg: [Sighs]
  Lois: ...we have a responsibility to use these powers properly and not
  to abuse them for personal gain. Understand?
  Brian: Yes.
  Chris: Yep.
  Meg: Yes.
  [Peter has transformed himself into a sandwich]
  Peter: Got it.
  Lois: Oh, no. I forgot the detergent. Excuse me, would you watch him
  for a moment?
  Clerk: Sure thing, ma'am. Whoa there, little guy. You got to pay for
  that.
  Stewie: Go suck a railroad spike. I haven't got any money.
  Clerk: Well, then I am afraid I am gonna have to take it away from you.
  [Screaming] Oh, God! Please help me!
  [Honking]
  Lois: Move it, you slowpoke! The light's green!
  Man: What does that cloud look like to you, honey? To me it looks like
  rain! Ha! I used that joke at work. I'm the funniest guy at the office.
  They say I should do standup.
  Lois: This is insane!
  Meg: Oh, my God, Dad! *NSYNC is in town. If you can get me a lock of
  Justin's hair I'll never ask you for shopping money again. Please?
  Peter: We promised Lois we'd use our powers responsibly. But I suppose
  doing the exact opposite couldn't hurt.
  *NSYNC Guy 1: Do you want to split a Toblerone?
  *NSYNC Guy 2: Oh, gosh. Yeah. I think I do. [Whistles like a train]
  Next stop, my thighs!
  Peter: All right, Meg, wait here. I'll be right back.
  Peter: Hi there. Britney Spears. You mind if I go in?
  Security Guard: Not at all, Miss Spears.
  Peter: Call me Peter. Hey there, fellas.
  Justin Timberlake: Britney? What are you doing here?
  Peter: Oh, you know, I was just in the neighborhood-I'm gonna steal one
  of your beers-and figured I'd stop by and say hi. You mind if I have a
  seat?
  Peter: I am out of shape. Say, Justin, I got a favor to ask you.
  Justin Timberlake: What is it?
  Peter: I got a hole in my muffler and I need something to plug it with.
  Peter: Can I have some of your hair?
  Justin Timberlake: Um, I guess so.
  Peter: Great. Thanks. All right, hold still now. You'll be fine. Hey,
  come here. Give me a kiss. [transforms into Gene Shalit] I'm Gene
  Shalit now! Bye!
  Bartender: Here's your martini, ma'am.
  Woman: Thanks. Hey, it's gone!
  Bartender: Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. Here's another one.
  Woman: What the hell is going on here?
  Brian: Hi. Can I get some pretzels or something? I got to drive. Did
  you bring enough breasts for the rest of the class? Ha-ha-ha!
  Chris: Hey, Hector, how long have we known each other?
  Hector: Since first grade.
  Chris: Yeah, yeah. You remember that time you called me "Chris Gristle"?
  Hector: I think so.
  Chris: Well, burn for it!
  Hector: [Screaming]
  Tom Tucker: It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a lower-middle-class Irish
  family.
  Diane Simmons: That's right, Tom. This is one of many public
  disturbances caused by the Griffin family of Quahog who seem to have
  acquired superpowers.
  Tom Tucker: Very strange story, Diane. Coming up next, can bees think?
  A new study confirms that, no, they cannot.
  Mayor West: Citizens of Quahog, we have a problem!
  Justin Timberlake: You're damn right we do! Peter Griffin stole my hair!
  Mayor West: Settle down, Jeffrey!
  Justin Timberlake: Justin.
  Mayor West: Mike. Clearly, the Griffin family is out of control. But
  not to fear. I've tangled with super-beings before. And they can be
  stopped!
  Peter: You can't stop us, Mayor West! We are all-powerful!
  Mayor West: Clearly, you've let yourselves become drunk with power.
  Stewie: Silence!
  Chris: We demand obedience!
  Meg: Or else!
  Man: Is that all you can do? [Meg scrapes him with nails] That kind of
  hurt! Is that bleeding? I guess it's all right. Ouch, though.
  Peter: Anyone who opposes our demands will be destroyed. Our first
  demand: you will erect a statue in the town square. This statue will
  depict Blair Warner admitting to Mrs. Garrett that the poem she
  submitted for her creative-writing class was actually plagiarized from
  a work by Emily Dickinson. We have spoken!
  Mayor West: That's it! We have to fight fire with fire. If nuclear
  refuse gave them superpowers, it could do the same for me. Citizens,
  I'm off to the toxic waste dump!
  Dr. Hartman: Mayor West, you have lymphoma.
  Mayor West: Oh, my!
  Dr. Hartman: Probably from rolling around in that toxic waste.
  Mayor West: I see.
  Dr. Hartman: What in God's name were you trying to prove?
  Mayor West: I was trying to gain superpowers.
  Dr. Hartman: Well, that's just silly.
  Mayor West: Silly, yes. Idiotic, yes.
  Peter: No, no! That's not what Mrs. Garrett's bosom looked like. It
  looked more like this. [Peter transforms himself into Mrs' Garrett's
  cleavage] Notice the sun spots at the top of the right can.
  Woman: Excuse me. I have a message from the Quahog Hospital.
  Peter: I just feel awful about this, Mayor West.
  Lois: Yeah. Me, too. Stewie, fluff his pillows.
  Chris: I'll heat up his soup.
  Brian: And I'll go to China to see if there's a cure. [leaves and
  returns with one of those conical straw hats] Nope.
  Mayor West: Now, now. The doctor says I'm gonna make a full recovery.
  The important thing is, you learned your lesson.
  Lois: I can't believe we let those superpowers go to our heads.
  Stewie: I feel like such a bastard.
  Brian: Me, too.
  Peter: For now, we are gonna use our powers to help you get better.
  Mayor West: Thank you. But as long as I have Mrs. Garrett's giant rack
  by my bedside, I'll be all right.
  Peter: Girls! Girls! Girls! [Laughing]
  
<Title card: Li'l Griffins>
<All the characters are now '30s-style children>
Peter: Hear ye, hear ye. I call to order the first meeting of the We
  Hate Broads Club.
  ALL: Yeah!
  Brian: Because all you need in life is your best pals.
  Quagmire: Sure! As long as those pals ain't dames!
  Cleveland: O-tay!
  [Creaking]
  Peter: What was that?
  Quagmire: Hey, I thought we told you guys to quit snooping around here!
  Tom Tucker: We need to find a story if I'm ever gonna be a big-time
  reporter, man.
  Peter: All right, all right. Make like Siamese twins and split...and
  then one of you die.
  Mayor West: When do we have the grape juice? I came for the grape juice.
<at school>
Peter: Hey, Quagmire, watch this.
Teacher:Hey, "kick me"!
[School bell ringing]
Teacher: Boys and girls, we have a new student joining us this morning.
  Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt.
  Peter: Just what we need, another girl.
  Quagmire: You said it!
  [Lois enters]
  Peter: Wow, I'd like to play doctor with her and remove her inflamed
  appendix before it bursts, causing sepsis.
  Quagmire: Gigidy-gigidy-gigidy! [Alfalfa-style cowlick straightens out]
  Peter: Hey, Lois, what you reading?
  Lois: 'The Red Badge of Courage.' I sure wish I could meet a brave
  fellow like the guy in this book.
  Peter: I'm a brave guy, Lois.
  Quagmire: Oh, yeah? I bet you're not brave enough to laugh at Death!
  Peter: Watch me. Ha-ha-ha!
  Death: Oh, thanks! Like I don't have enough trouble fitting in!
  Peter: I bet you're not brave enough to take all your clothes off!
  Quagmire: Way ahead of you. Oh!
  Peter: Well, I bet you're too chicken to spend a night at the old
  Selberg place.
  [Eerie instrumental music]
  Peter: Uh, Cleveland, you mind stepping out of the way?
  Cleveland: Oh, sorry.
  [Eerie instrumental music]
  Quagmire: Well, I ain't chicken to spend the night there!
  Peter: Well, I ain't neither! And to prove it, I'm going up there
  tonight!
  Quagmire: See you there, pal!
  Mort Goldman: You can't stay in that house! Old Man Selberg's ghost
  still haunts it. Not to mention the myriad of bacteria and allergens
  from years of substandard housekeeping. It does not augur well for you.
  Peter: Aw, Zip it, egghead. You with your big words and your small,
  difficult words.
  Lois: Wow. Any boy who would spend the night in that creepy place sure
  would be the bravest fellow I ever met.
  Peter: That Lois is some kind of woman. Quagmire: Yeah. Just thinking
  about her makes my testicles want to drop. Oops! Speak of the devil.
  Oop, make that devils.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]
  Joe: All right. Quagmire's team will take the left side of the house.
  Peter's team will take the right. And whoever's alive in the morning
  can bury his dead pals.
  Cleveland: Do I have a cobweb in my hair? It feels like I have a cobweb
  in my hair.
  [Wolf howling]
  Cleveland: What was that?
  Quagmire: It's just Michael Winslow from Police Academy.
  Michael Winslow: [Growling] [Monkey noise] [Helicopter noise] [Elephant
  noise] [Baaing like a sheep] [Submarine noise]
  Joe: This house gives me the creeps.
  Brian: Yeah. Let's get out of here.
  Peter: Wait, wait, wait. We can't let those guys win. What we ought to
  do is pretend we're ghosts, see-
  Quagmire: -and then we'll scare the other guys out of the house-
  Peter: -then we can say that we spent-
  Quagmire: -the-
  Peter: -night. Then, everyone will think we're-
  Quagmire: -the-
  Peter: -bravest kids in the world. Especially Lois.
  Quagmire: All right!
  Peter: Hey, I got a great idea! <gets into suit of armor>
  This'll really scare them. Everybody set?
  Joe: Check!
  Brian: Check!
  Goldie Hawn: Sock it to me!
  Mayor West: If we only had a teacup, this'd be like playing Find the
  Teacup in the Bed Sheet, like I do with my Aunt Sophia.
  Peter: My God! Not only are ghosts real, but their innards are made of
  children.
  Quagmire: Peter, it's us!
  Peter: Say, that's a nice effect.
  Quagmire: Yeah. That's really scary.
  Peter: Wait a second. If you're there, and I'm here and Istanbul is
  somewhere in this general area then who the hell is that?
  [Screaming]
  Tom Tucker: Ha-Get used to this sight, Diane. Guys running away from
  you.
  Diane Simmons: Tom, you're so deep in the closet, you're finding
  Christmas presents.
  Peter: All right. Now, remember our story. We tell Lois that we both
  stayed all night. I caught the ghost with my lasso.
  Quagmire: And I punched him so hard, he ran crying all the way back to
  Hell!
  Peter: She'll have to believe that. It hangs together so perfectly.
  Diane Simmons: Our top story today, cowardly kids lay down rubber at
  the old Selberg place.
  Peter: Wait. Turn that up.
  Tom Tucker: Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire were seen bolting
  <gets louder> were seen bolting out of the supposedly
  haunted house after just one half-hour leaving only their pride and
  twin trails of urine behind them.
  Quagmire: Cheese and crackers! Now Lois'll know everything!
  Peter: Not if I can help it!
  [Imitates phone ringing]
  Tom Tucker: Newsroom.
  Peter: Hello. This is Peter Griffin. You'd better stop saying that
  stuff or we'll watch something else!
  Girl: <in Barbara Walters-like voice> Today on The View,
  cooties, the silent killer.
  Peter: Lois? There's something we got to tell you.
  Quagmire: Yeah. We didn't stay in the haunted house. We're not brave.
  Lois: Oh, I've decided I don't care about bravery.
  Peter and Quagmire: You don't?
  Lois: No. I realized what I really like is smarts.
  Mort Goldman: Sorry I'm late, darling. I was checking my stool for
  blood.
  Peter and Quagmire: Mort Goldman!
  Lois: He's so clever! Show them, Morty!
  Peter: He got us again!
  Quagmire: This whole thing just shows that women are nothing but
  trouble!
  Peter: You said it! Let's you and me swear off them for good!
  Quagmire: And how!
<35 years later>
Peter: I say, Quagmire, it seems to me we've each made another $500
  million.
  Quagmire: Good thing we swore off women so we wouldn't be distracted
  and unable to accumulate this vast amount of wealth.
  Peter: Yes. You watch the ticker. I'm gonna microwave a bagel and have
  sex with it.
  Quagmire: Butter's in the fridge!
  [Closing Theme]



Title: When You Wish Upon a Weinstein

Theme Song
  Chris: Dad, can you help me with my math? Mr. Shackleford says if I
  don't learn it, I won't function in the real world.
<cut to Chris talking to a hick at a rundown gas station>
  Man: What you gotta do is go down the road past the old Johnson place.
  You're gonna find two roads, one parallel and one perpendicular. Keep
  going until you come to a highway that bisects it at a 45 degree angle.
  Solve for x.
  Chris: [lies on ground and sucks thumb]
  Peter: Math. Math, my dear boy, is nothing more than the lesbian sister
  of biology.
  [Knocking]
  Jim Kaplan: Hello, sir.
  Peter: Enough with the foreplay, sailor. What are you selling?
  Jim Kaplan: Well, I was gonna try to sell you some "handsome cream" but
  I can see you already bought out the store!
  Peter: Go on.
  Jim Kaplan: Perhaps you'd be interested in something every homeowner
  cannot be without. Volcano insurance!
  Peter: Go on.
  Jim Kaplan: According to my uncle-who's a real whiz with volcanoes-a
  volcano is coming this way!
  Peter: [Thinking] I, too, have an uncle.
  Peter: Come in.
  Peter: How much is this volcano insurance?
  Jim Kaplan: Uh, I don't know. Let's say, $200.
  Peter: $200? That's more than I spent on all that handsome cream.
  Peter: I don't have that kind of money!
  Jim Kaplan: What about that jar of money?
  Peter: No way! That's Lois' rainy day fund.
  Jim Kaplan: Ah, come on, it never rains in Rhode Island.
  Peter: Yeah, but I'm pretty sure we've never had a volcano either.
  Jim Kaplan: Well, don't you think we're overdue for one?
  Peter: Touché, salesman.
<cut to Meg looking down on Stewie in his crib>
  Stewie: [snoring, then gasping awake]
  Stewie: Ah! What the hell are you doing?
  Meg: Watching you sleep, cutie pie.
  Stewie: Why you sick, sick little moo cow. Well, you shall watch no
  more! [smashes Meg's glasses]
  Lois: Stewie!
  Meg: My glasses! I can't see a thing without my glasses! Why won't you
  let me get laser surgery?
  Lois: Because I don't think it's safe.
<cut to Millennium Falcon; Luke Skywalker is using his light
  saber for eye surgery>
  Luke Skywalker: Okay, I just need to make a quick incision here and we
  should be all done, Mrs. Wilson.
  Obi-Wan Kenobi: Luke, use the Force.
  Luke Skywalker: Really? 'Cause I was just gonna make...
  Obi-Wan Kenobi: Use-use the Force.
  Luke Skywalker: Okay!
  [picks up light saber with the Force, then stabs woman through the head]
  Woman: [Screaming]
  Luke Skywalker: Are you happy?
  Obi-Wan Kenobi: I've never been happy.
  Lois: Don't worry, honey. We'll get you a new pair tomorrow.
  Stewie: In the meantime, here's a little vision test. What is this? A
  poopie or a Toblerone?

Announcer: We now return to "Girlfriends" on Lifetime.
  Woman 1: Barry was over last night.
  Woman 2: Don't tell me.
  BOTH: He left the toilet seat up!
  [Audience laughing]
  Woman 1: Oh, I ran into Frank. It's funny. He fought in Vietnam, he's
  an exorcist, but there is one thing that terrifies him.
  BOTH: Commitment!
  [Audience laughing]
  Woman 1: Oh, Midge, you're my third best friend in the whole world.
  Woman 2: Third? Who are the first two?
  Woman 1: Ben and Jerry.
  [Audience laughing]
  Announcer:Lifetime, television for idiots.
  Lois: Peter, did you take the money from the family jar?
  Peter: Who, me? Yes, me. Couldn't be. Then who? Yeah, I did it. I
  bought us volcano insurance.
  Lois: Volcano insurance? That's ridiculous.
  Peter: That's the same thing you said when you talked me out of cloud
  insurance.
  Peter: Look at them up there just plottin', pickin' their moment.
<in the sky>
  Cloud 1: So, Bill.
  Cloud 1: We attack tomorrow.
  Cloud 2: Yes, tomorrow.
  Cloud 1: I mean it this time.
  Cloud 2: I do, too!
  Lois: That was our emergency money and your daughter needs a new pair
  of glasses.
  Peter: Lois, no one really needs glasses.
  Lois: You wear glasses.
  Peter: That's only to fool the man from the draft board.
  Lois: I can't believe you squandered that money! I swear, sometimes I
  feel like I'm married to a child.
<Peter and Lois's wedding>
  Peter: What can I say about my beautiful bride except milk, milk,
  lemonade. Around the corner, fudge is made!
  Peter: You better watch who you call a child, Lois. Because if I'm a
  child, then you know what that makes you? A pedophile! And I'll be
  damned if I'm gonna stand here and be lectured by a pervert!
<Drunken Clam>
  Peter: Can you believe it, Cleveland? Lois thinks I'm bad with money.
  Cleveland: She's got a point, Peter. You're the white version of a
  black guy who's not good with his money.
  Quagmire: Hey, guys and dolls! Drinks are on do-re-me! [slams wad of
  cash on bar]
  Peter: Where'd you get that?
  Quagmire: This loot's thanks to my stockbroker, lan Greenstein. He made
  some smart investments that really paid off. That guy is to money what
  Miss Ann-Margaret is to...[Makes squeaky bed noises; then chair
  collapses]
  Cleveland: Let me buy the drinks, Quagmire. My accountant, Larry
  Rosenblat, just got me a huge tax refund and tickets to "Bring In 'Da
  Noise, Bring In 'Da Funk". The noise was good, but I thought they
  phoned in a lot of the funk.
  Peter: Wait a second. Rosenblat? Greenstein? So I need a Jewish guy to
  handle my money?
  Cleveland: Peter, not every Jewish person is good with money.
  Peter: Well, yeah, I guess not the retarded ones. But why would you
  even say that? For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, there's "edgy" and
  there's "offensive." Good day, sir!
<Lois is on the phone>
  Lois: Mother, you know how I hate asking for money, but...Mother,
  Peter's an excellent provider...No, Mother, I do not think I'd be
  better off married to a chimp...I don't care how well that chimp across
  the street is doing...Really?...Well, yeah, okay. I guess you can tell
  him I said hi. But don't make me sound desperate!
  Peter: I gotta get a Greenstein or a Rosenblat of my very own.
  Peter: â™ªNothing else has worked so

  I use your phone?
  Peter: â™ªNow my troubles are all

  â™ªI have a

  Max Weinstein: Hey!
  Peter: I prayed for you, Max Weinstein, and here you are.
  Max Weinstein: Okay. Listen, uh, thanks for letting me use the phone.
  Peter: Thanks for Spaceballs.
  Max Weinstein: If there's anything I can do for you...
  Peter: You can't leave!
  [Dramatic instrumental music] <footchase>
  Max Weinstein: What do you want?
  Peter: Financial advice.
  Max Weinstein: Financial advice? How the Hell did you know I'm an
  accountant?
  Peter: Hello! 'Max Weinstein'?
  Max Weinstein: Look, I'll do what I can, but I don't know why you think
  I can get your money back.
  Peter: Max, Max, Max-let's not deny our heritages. You're Jewish,
  you're good with money. I'm Irish, I drink, and I ban homosexuals from
  marching in my parade. Now, help me get my money back.
  Jim Kaplan: Oh, it's you. [Stammering] I'm not in right now. Please
  leave a message. Beep!
  Peter: Man, I hate these things. Yeah, hi, this is Peter Griffin. I'm
  sorry I missed you-
  Max Weinstein: Play with this. Sir, I have reviewed this contract, and
  it offers no coverage at all. It just says "volcano insurance" over and
  over again and down here in small print it says: "He's signing it. He's
  signing it. I can't believe it."
  Jim Kaplan: So?
  Max Weinstein: Refund his money and we'll go.
  Jim Kaplan: I don't have your money!
  Max Weinstein: How about that money?
  Jim Kaplan: No way! That's Lois' rainy day fund!...Damn it!
  [Laugh track on TV]
  Jerry Seinfeld: You couldn't date her because she was a tickler.

  Jerry Seinfeld: Not a tickler stickler.
  George Costanza: Not a tickler stickler.
  BOTH: [Absurd babbling]
  Brian: Where the hell is the remote?
  Peter: Hey, honey, guess what? I got back the money for Meg's glasses.
  Lois: Really? Oh, honey! Hello.
  Peter: This is my special friend, Max Weinstein. He's Jewish.
  Lois: Oh my, how exotic.
  Max Weinstein: Thank you?
  Peter: See, here's your rainy day money and I balanced our checkbook,
  too.
  Lois: You balanced our checkbook?
  Peter: Yep. Isn't that right, Max?
  Max Weinstein: Yeah, sure. He did it.
  Lois: I'll going to go call my mother right now and tell her to tell
  that chimp across the street [shrieks like a chimpanzee].
  Peter: Look how low I've sunk-taking credit for something a smart
  Jewish person did.
  Max Weinstein: That's okay, Peter.
  Peter: No. People have been doing that for too damn long.
<protest rally>
  Civil Rights Speaker: It is the white devil that has propagated,
  exacerbated, instigated, instigated.... Line!
  Woody Allen: "Instigated our hatred like a Buick." What was I thinking
  when I agreed to this? This is so degrading. This is worse than the
  time I was at the Friars' Club and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my
  pants.
  Max Weinstein: Lois, I appreciate the marshmallow and fish casserole,
  but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.
  Lois: Oh, because it's not kosher.
  Max Weinstein: Yeah, let's go with that.
  Chris: Can Stewie and me be excused? He's gonna help me with my math
  homework.
  Lois: Chris, he's just a baby.
  Stewie: Oh, and you're a regular Rhodes scholar. Where was it you
  graduated from again? The University of Duh?
  Max Weinstein: I can help you with your homework, son.
  Peter: My God! Is there nothing you people can't do? I mean, y'know,
  other than manual labor.
  Lois: Peter, what a ridiculous thing to say! They built the pyramids.
  You'll have to excuse Peter. He can be a little tactless sometimes.
  Brian: Yes, like the time he soiled himself at that dinner party?
<dinner party> Lois: I was so sorry to hear that your
  father passed away.
  Woman: Yes. It spread through his body so fast. But he's at peace now
  and the whole...
  Peter: Uh-oh!
  Peter: Well, there's only one thing that'll top a great dinner like
  that. Operation!
  Lois: May I play?
  KIDS: Mom!
  Max Weinstein: Thank you, but I can't stay. It's Friday, I've got to go
  to Temple.
  Peter: Temple? Like Indiana Jones?
<forgotten temple scene from the beginning of 'Raiders of the
  Lost Ark'> [Suspenseful instrumental music]
<Indiana dawdles over picking up the idol>
  Ralph Kramden: Will you just pick it up already!
<at Temple Beth Thupporting Actor>
  Peter: They better not be expecting us to give money 'cause I already
  gave at church last Sunday, and I'm pretty sure it all goes to the same
  God.
  Lois: Peter! Max, it was nice of you to invite us along.
  Max Weinstein: Your husband's got a good heart, Lois, but his views on
  Judaism are a little misguided. I'd consider it a mitzvah to educate
  him a little.
  Stewie: No. I don't think so. It's not that I have ideological
  differences, I'm just not a hat person.
  Peter: Hey, look! I didn't know the principal of Meg's school was
  Jewish. Hey, there's Bill Nye, the Science Guy and half of Lenny
  Kravitz. Optimus Prime? He's Jewish?
  [Mechanisms whirring]
  Peter: Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to Catholic school.
  I'm not sure this is allowed. Ah, what the hell?

  Woman: Hello.
  Lois: We're not Jewish. But I hear you people have such lovely
  services. Oh, my God! I didn't mean "you people." I didn't mean "Oh, MY
  God," either. I know he's your God, too. [Nervous laughter]
  Woman: [Shushing]
  Rabbi:: And on this day, the Sabbath we gather here to...
  Peter: Uh-oh!
  Lois: Well, that was so nice. A good sermon and such beautiful songs.
  Peter: Yeah, it was just like that other Jewish musical we saw.
  [Fiddle playing]
  William Shatner: A fiddler on the roof sounds crazy, no? But here in
  our little village of Anatevka, you might say each one of us...
  William Shatner: Kahn! Kahn!
  Max Weinstein: Well, there's my cab. It was nice meeting all of you.
  Peter: Thanks for everything, buddy.
  Chris: Wait. I thought you were gonna help me with my homework.
  Max Weinstein: I'm sorry, son. I have to go. But, I'm sure you'll do
  just fine.
  Peter: I don't know, Max, the kid's not exactly an honor roll student.
  Watch. [hits Chris]
  Chris: Hey!
  Peter: He did it. [points to lamp]
  [Chris assaults lamp]
  Peter: See?
  Max Weinstein: Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came to Temple
  with me. You're a nice family. I have faith that Chris will grow up to
  be a real mensch.
  Chris: Dad!
  Peter: Lois, I just figured out how to make sure Chris becomes a big
  success.
  Lois: Tell me this doesn't have anything to do with Tony Robbins.
  Peter: No, I learned my lesson.
<bookstore signing>
  Peter: Could you sign this book, please?
  Tony Robbins: Tony Robbins hungry! [Growling, swallows Peter]
  Peter: No, Lois, I'm gonna make Chris Jewish!
  Lois: What are you talking about?
  Brian: He thinks if Chris is Jewish, he'll become smart.
  Lois: Peter, you can't convert someone because you think it'll help
  their grades. Now I don't want to hear another word about this.
  Peter: [signing] She won't have to hear another word, because luckily
  we've mastered American sign language.
  Chris: [signing] Ha-ha-ha-ha!
  Chris: Where are we going?
  Peter: Son, it's too late for me, and Meg's a girl, but for you, the
  sky's the limit. We're gonna take you down to that synagogue and turn
  you Jewish!
  Chris: Okay!
  Peter: Chris, duck!
  [Nuns chattering raucously]
  Rabbi: [Sighing] Mr. Griffin, I still don't understand. Why exactly
  does your son want to join the Jewish faith?
  Peter: Heck, I don't know. He's bi-curious.
  Rabbi: I appreciate your interest, but Judaism takes a serious
  commitment. Elliott here has spent years preparing for his bar mitzvah
  this Saturday.
  Peter: A bar mitzvah! Perfect. How much for one of those?
  Rabbi: You can't just buy a bar mitzvah. It requires a lot of study.
  Peter: Can't we skip that part? I mean, c'mon, if Chris knew how to
  study, he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right? Right? Right?
  Chris: Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a bar mitzvah. I'm okay just the
  way I...[screaming, as head is caught in car window]
  Peter: We got no time to lose. There's gotta be someplace in America
  where you can take a solemn spiritual ceremony that begins a lifetime
  commitment and blow through it in about 20 minutes.
<cut to Las Vegas>
  [Peppy instrumental music]
  Chris: All right, Dad!
<kitchen>
  Meg: So, how do I look in my new glasses?
  Stewie: How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere there's a portrait
  of you getting prettier.
  Lois: Wow, someone needs a nap. After lunch it's straight to bed,
  Stewie.
  Stewie: This isn't the first time my wit has gone unappreciated.
<Star Search>
  Ed McMahon: And in the comedy competition, Stewie Griffin receives
  three and a half stars. Challenger Sinbad receives four stars! We have
  a new champion, Sinbad! Stewie, any parting words?
  Stewie: Um, you know, I got beat, pure and simple. You-you are a very
  funny man! "Men be acting all like zombies at the mall." God, ain't
  that the truth?
  Lois: Where's your father and Chris? It's not like them to be late for
  lunch.
  Meg: I think they left a note.
  [Dear Lois. Chris and I...(Erased) Went to the library to read lots of
  books ...(Erased) have gone clothes shopping with you ...(Erased) are
  invisible, but right here anyway... have gone fishing -peter]
  Brian: [chuckles]
  Lois: Brian, what do you know about this?
  Brian: Nothing.
  Lois: I know when you're lying to me, Brian.
  Brian: No, I swear.
  Lois: Meg, take Stewie upstairs.
  Brian: What-What are you doing?
  Lois: Oh, you don't know that, either? Last chance, Brian.
  Brian: [yelps] They're in Vegas getting a quickie bar mitzvah!
  Lois: What?
  Quagmire: Well, hel-Lois! Forgive me for pointing.
  Lois: Quick, I need to borrow your car! I've got a bar mitzvah to stop!
  Quagmire: No problem. Let me grab my keys. [lengthy crotch-level
  grabbing] Here they are.
  [Engine starting] [Dramatic instrumental music] [Mysterious Yiddish
  music playing] [Crowd cheering]
  Peter: Chris, in a few minutes, you'll become a smart, successful
  Jewish man. I could make a foreskin joke right now, but this is a
  solemn occasion. And, besides, there'll be plenty of time for that on
  the ride back. I got so many of them, too! I know, I know, shh, shh.
  But later!
  [Dramatic instrumental music] [Dramatic music slowing]
  Chris:[Chants in Hebrew: Cherish God the cherished]
  Lois: Chris! [Banging] [yelling]
  Lois: Stop this travesty right now!
  Woman: Bar mitzvahs are travesties, huh?
  Lois: No, my son getting bar mitzvahed is a travesty. He's doing it for
  all the wrong reasons.
  Mordecai: Well, look-a-here, Herschel. We got us one of them
  self-hating Jews.
  Herschel: Nothing I hate worse than a Jew who doesn't appreciate her
  own rich heritage. Come on, Mordecai. Let's get her!
  [Angry crowd yelling] [People gasping] [Banging]
  Peter: I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son to be Jewish so he'd be
  smarter. Then maybe his wife wouldn't be sorry she didn't marry the
  chimp next door.
  Lois: Oh, Peter, just because Steven makes more money than you doesn't
  mean he's any smarter. And I think Chris will do just fine.
  Peter: How do you know that?
  Lois: Because I have faith in him, the way I have faith in you.
  Besides, a person's religion is no guarantee of success.
  Peter: I see what you're saying. The Jewish are just like us. No
  better, no worse.
  Chris: Yeah, and as they say...[Speaking Hebrew]
  Lois: What?
  Peter: I think what he's trying to say is everything's gonna be okay.
  [Dramatic instrumental music]

  Peter: [Peter screaming]

Peter is addressing the family, who is sitting on the couch.
  Peter: Everybody, I got bad news: We've been canceled!
  Lois: Oh, no! Peter, how could they do that?
  Peter: Well, unfortunately, Lois, there's just no more room on the
  schedule. We've just got to accept the fact that Fox has to make room
  for terrific shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That
  80's Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe,
  Skin, Girl's Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freaky
  Links, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan
  Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The Street,
  American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the
  Bunny.
  Lois: Is there no hope?
  Peter: Well, I suppose if all those shows go down the tubes we might
  have a shot.
  Theme Song
  Peter is watching television. Brian enters.
  Brian: What are you watching, Peter?
  Peter: Passion of the Christ. I tell you, Brian, I can't believe that

  something about it
  Cut Scene: Peter is being lashed with a cat-"o"-nine-tails.
  Peter: AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
  Hey! Stop it. Stop it.
  Guard: OK.
  Peter: OK?
  Guard: OK.
  Peter: All right.
  End cut scene. Lois enters.
  Lois: Hi boys.
  Peter: I didn't have my hands down my pants!
  Lois: Hmmmm, good for you. I got us some new sheets from Bed, Bath, and
  Beyond
  Peter: Oh boy, I hope you stayed away from the "Beyond" section.
  Cut-Scene: Peter approaches the "Beyond" Section. He opens the doors
  and enters a space-time void.
  Peter: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH--Oh, here are the coffee mugs.
  end cut scene.
  Peter and Lois are in bed. Peter is flipping through channels; Lois is
  reading a book. Lois puts down the book and leans over to Peter
  Lois: Honey, what do you say we, uh, christen these new sheets, huh?
  Peter: Why, Lois Griffin, you naughty girl.
  Lois: *giggles* That's me.
  Peter: You dirty hustler.
  Lois: *chuckles*
  Peter: You filthy, stinking prostitute.
  Lois: Haha-OK, I get it.
  Peter: You foul, venereal-disease-carrying, street-walking whore.
  Lois: All right, that's enough!
  Peter and Lois's lovemaking is making a creaking noise which others in
  the house can hear. Stewie is asleep. In his dream he associates the
  creaking with the creaking of his rocking chair. He says
  Stewie: Aaaah, it's good to have land.
  Peter and Lois are making making sex noises.
  Lois: Oh, oh.... GEORGE!
  Peter: George? Who the hell is George?!
  Lois: George Clooney?
  Peter: Our sex is so dull for you that you got to fantasize about
  George Clooney?
  Lois: I'm sorry, honey, I guess that things have become a little stale
  for me.
  Peter: Well I, I don't know what to do, I mean I don't really know that
  much about any kinky stuff. I mean I, I could hook this car battery up
  to my nipples. AH! AH! AH! AH! OH GOD! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! This
  doing it for ya? OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!
  Lois: Oh, I don't know. I just don't feel that spark anymore; I mean...
  our honeymoon, ah so much rugburn!
  Peter: Wait a second, Lois, that's what we need. We'll go on a second
  honeymoon!
  Lois: *gasp* Peter, that's a wonderful idea!
  Peter: Yeah, we'll be just like "The Honeymooners."
  Cut Scene. It's the Honeymooners.
  Ralph: One of these days, Alice. One of these days.
  Alice: Yeah, yeah I know, Ralph; Right to the moon.
  Laughter. Ralph punches Alice in the face. The audience gasps and Ralph
  has a look of shock on his face. He slowly backs towards the door and
  sprints out. end cut scene.
  Lois: Well that's everything. Now, remember, kids, Brian is in charge
  while your father and I are out at Cape Cod.
  Brian: I'll take good care of them, Lois, you guys have a good time.
  Group: Bye.
  Chris: Bye, mom, I LOVE YOU!
  Stewie: You know, Brian if i choose to make stool in my pants right
  now, you're the only one here to change me. What do you think of that?
  Hmmmmm?
  Brian: I'm not going to change you.
  Stewie: What?
  Brian: I said I'm not going to change you.
  Stewie: Oh you can't be serious. What if--what if i make a fudgie? Well
  I just wont. I just won't, that's all, I just won't. BLAST! I just did.
  Meg: AH! Chris, cut it out. Brian, Chris just picked his nose and he
  keeps touching me with his finger!
  Chris: What good is mining nose gold if i cant share it with the
  townspeople?
  Brian: I swear to god, these kids are going to make me put a bullet
  through my head.
  Stewie: Well, if I was in charge, we wouldn't be having this problem
  right now.
  Brian: Well, you've got some ideas, tell me.
  Stewie: Oh I'll tell you of course. I'll want a favor in exchange.
  Brian is changing Stewie.
  Stewie: Ahahaha how does it smell, dog, does it smell like servitude?
  Ahaha! Aft torpedos fire!
  Interior of car. Peter is driving and Lois is sleeping.
  Peter: Lois? Hey, Lois, honey? Sweetheart? Peter swerves the car so
  Lois hits her head on the window. Oh you,re awake, hey, will you pass
  me the pretzels?
  Lois: Peter, where are we?
  Peter: About two hours from Cape Cod's most luxurious Bed &
  Breakfast.
  Lois: Oh, Peter, this is going to be so wonderful I'm so excited i want
  to prep my diaphragm right now.
  Peter: Hehehe. Gross. Hey why don't you go back to sleep? I'll wake you
  when we get there.
  Lois: Ok.
  Peter slides a comic book up in front of the windshield, so he can't
  see where he's driving. The comic appears to have Jughead near a pile
  of hamburgers.
  Peter: Hehehehehe, look at all those hamburgers. You can't eat all
  those hamburgers, you stupid fellow--Peter realizes he's swerving off
  the road. Oh jeeze! Peter rights the car and then slides the comic back
  up. Oh! he's going to do it. Oh, he's so ridiculous. You hear me, you
  ridiculous man?? You're -- whoa!!!
  The car crashes into a tree.
  Lois: Peter, what the hell is wrong with you? I fall asleep for ten
  minutes and you plow the car into a tree? Oh my god, you got to pay
  attention to the road! We could have been killed! Will you look at the
  front of our car? It's totaled, it's completely totaled! Oh this is
  terrific, how are we gonna get--oh my god, I knew I should have driven.
  I should always drive. I can not trust you--
  During the above rant, Peter starts to slide the comic book back up
  into his field of vision, this time blocking Lois.
  COMMERCIAL BREAK
  Peter and Lois are in a rundown motel.
  Lois: Dear God, this is where we're sleeping?
  Peter: Aw, come on Lois. They said they'd have the car fixed by
  tomorrow and then our second honeymoon's [is this wrong?] be right back
  on track, eh?

  another. The torso of the half man cries out.
  Torso: AAAAAAAAAH! Help me!
  Meg: Turn it Chris, I wanna watch George Lopez.

  funny. Give me that.
  Meg: Chris give me the remote. Chris stop. Chris! Chris grabs her hat.
  *gasp* My hat!
  Chris: stuffs the hat down his pants. Ahahaha! Wear it now!

  Nermal is here to stay! Or is he? Let's read on.
  Brian: over phone OK, I'll be there. To Stewie Peter and Lois were
  supposed to chaperone Chris's school dance tomorrow night. So I guess
  it's up to me.
  Stewie: You mean it's up to us. Clearly you need my help with this
  parenting thing you're too stupid to do it alone. Besides I know how to
  deal with children unlike Mr. Gepetto.
  Cutaway scene of Pinocchio and Gepetto.
  Gepetto: Oh no, I dropped my glasses. bends over, away from Pinocchio,
  to pick them up. Uh, by the way, Pinocchio, there was a cookie missing
  from the jar. Did you, uh did you take it by any chance?
  Pinocchio: Yes, papa Gepetto, I'm sorry.
  Gepetto: Are you sure you took it? Because I'd believe you if you said
  you didn't.
  Pinocchio: No I took it, papa. I wouldn't lie to you.
  Gepetto: You could try and, who knows, you might get away with it.
  Cutaway ends. Peter and Lois.
  Peter: 900 bucks to fix the car that was all the money we had for this

  the opening of Manhattan's newest luxury hotel.
  Tricia Takanawa: Diane, I'm standing outside the Park Barrington Hotel,
  because they dont allow Asians inside.
  Peter: Fancy place. Boy, that would make some second honeymoon, huh?
  Tricia Takanawa: The Park Barrington is already attracting some big
  names, such as Christianity enthusiast Mel Gibson who has his own room
  on permannt reserve. A room which he barely uses.
  Peter: Barely uses, huh? Lois, I just got an idea much better than that
  time I experimented with gene splicing.
  Cutaway scene of Peter walking into the kitchen. He has a moose head.

  out those creamy hamstrings.
  Interior of the men's room.
  Friend: Come on Chris its just vodka. Jake swiped it from his dad's
  liquor cabinet.
  Jake: Yeah, see? it's good!
  Chris: Well, OK maybe just one sip
  Teacher: Christopher Griffin, is that alcohol? Mister, you are in
  serious trouble.
  G.I. Joe: He's absolutely right, kids, because when you drink nobody
  wins. In fact last year alone there were over 27,000 deaths from
  chronic liver disease as a result of alcohol abuse.
  Kids: Now we know!
  G.I. Joe: And knowing is half the battle!
  GI JOOOOOE!
  Lois: Peter, we can't afford this.

  Cut to Brian and Stewie lecturing Chris in the car.'

  "grown-up"?
  Chris: I didn't actually drink any of it. Besides, Jake Tucker gave it
  to me.
  Stewie: Well, we are going to have a talk with Jake's parents tomorrow
  after my burping.
  Brian: In the meantime, you're grounded.
  Chris: Aw, that sucks.
  Stewie: Do you want us to pull over?
  Chris: I don't care what you do.
  Stewie: Oh we'll pull over. We'll pull over. Pull over.

  Cut to Lois and Peter in the Gibson suite.
  Peter: Heheheheh!
  Lois: Ooooooh, Mel!
  Peter: turns on the light. Mel? Wait a minute, you were fantasizing
  about Mel Gibson. You--you don't find me attractive anymore.
  Lois: Honey, I'm sorry, I know you're trying but you can't rush the
  spark back into our marriage.
  Peter: Well, then I guess this whole second honeymoon was a waste of
  time. I don't want to talk about it. I'm just going to watch british
  porn.
  Man on TV: You know, Maragaret, we could have sexual intercourse right
  now.
  Woman on TV: Yes, yes, we could.
  Man on TV: Hmmm, but let's not.
  Cut to Stewie and Brian in bed.
  Stewie: Do you think we were too hard on Chris tonight?
  Brian: What? oh no no no I don't think so. Do you?
  Stewie: Oh no, I just always feel bad when we have to be strict. Ah,
  did I remember to turn the stove off? Yes.
  Cut to Lois and Peter in the Gibson suite.
  Lois: I'm sorry for everything that's happened, Peter. I guess I'm
  going through a phase right now where I'm only attracted to handsome
  men.
  Peter: Well, what are we supposed to do, Lois,just admit that there's
  no excitement left in our marriage, go home and spend the rest of our
  lives looking at each other across the breakfast table talking about
  how much we both like Total?
  Lois: Oh, I love Total.
  Peter: Ooooh, actually, so do I, and it's healthy for you too--oh god
  it's startin' already. Lois we are screwed.

  Peter: Oh man, that's all we need: more Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo jumbo.
  Well, not if I have anything to say about it. I am going to make sure
  this never sees the lght of day
  Lois: Peter, are you crazy? Stealing Mel Gibson's towels, bathrobes,
  and nazi paraphernelia is one thing, but this is a multi-million dollar
  film an he's a very powerful man he could have us arrested or killed.
  Peter: Well it's worth the risk, Lois. To save the world another 2
  hours of torture. We've got to get rid of this thing for the sake of
  Jesus and Snoopy and all the other beloved children's characters.
  Priest: Pardon me. We work for Mel Gibson. Seems he left something very
  valuable in his room and we're here to retrieve it.
  Clerk: Mr. Gibson just checked out a moment ago. There he goes now.
  Peter: Uh-oh. lois, run.
  Priest: Hey! Stop!
  He flings his collar which has blades on either end. Lois and Peter
  exit out the door and the two priests pursue them. Tricia Takanawa
  enters the building.
  Clerk: Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
  Tricia turns around, head hung, and exits. Commercial Break
  Lois: They're gaining on us. Oh, we never should've stolen this film.
  Peter: Oh, man. This is even more intense than that time I forgot how
  to sit down.
  Cut scene. Peter approaches a chair and stares at it. After a moment of
  pondering, he leaps at it, breaking the chair and contorting his limbs.
  End cut scene.
  Peter: Don't worry, Lois, I think I know how to lose em.
  Blues Brothers chase scene through the mall
  Lois: Peter, what the hell are you doing?
  Peter: Lois trust me. How many times have I done this before?
  Lois: All right, but be careful.
  The priests crash and Lois and Peter escape out of the mall. Brian and
  Stewie are outside Tom Tuckers house. Brian rings the bell.
  Brian: OK, now be polite and for God's sake don't mention anything
  about his kid's face
  Stewie: Oh, shut up. I am alwys so polite.
  Brian: Heh, I hope we dont wind up on the evening news because of this.
  Stewie: He he he. You're funny.
  Tom Tucker: Ah Brian! Please come in. Can my wife, Stacy get you
  anything?
  Stacy Tucker :Go to hell, Tom.
  Tom Tucker: Already there, hon.
  Brian: Well, uh, Mr. Tucker it seems your son Jake had some vodka at
  the school dance and Chris got blamed for it. This, uh, this whole
  situation has turned his life upside-down face.
  Stewie slowly gives Brian an awkward glare.
  Tom Tucker: Well it's no concern of mine if it turned his life
  upside-down face. Jakes a good boy, aren't you Jake?
  Jake Tucker: Yeah!
  Brian: Look Mr. Tucker I...
  Tom Tucker: We're though here. Get out of my house Benji!
  Brian: Well fine, if you're going to be that way about it maybe I'll do
  this.
  Brian begins scooting around on the carpet.
  Brian: Yeah, look at this.
  Tom Tucker: Stop that!
  Brian: Oh yeah, you don't like that.
  Tom Tucker: Stop doing that on my carpet.
  Brian: This is what Benji would do.
  Tom Tucker: Stop it! Stop it!
  Brian: It feels so good, it feels so good.
  Cut to Brian & Stewie driving in the car.
  Brian: There's got to be a way to get back at Jake Tucker for what he
  did to Chris.
  Stewie: I know, I know, I know, let's plant drugs in his locker.
  Brian: Oh my god, that's a great idea.
  Stewie: I thought you'd like that. Hey look at that Yosemite Sam
  mudflap. You better stay back Brian. nyeeeh.
  Cut back to Peter & Lois in the car.
  Peter: *sigh* Think we lost 'em. You stay here I'm gunna go bury this
  film.
  Peter begins to bury the film.
  Peter: Well Mel Gibson, this is one piece of crap the world will never
  have to suffer through. Hehehehe, I am so clever. That's why they
  picked me to convince Congress to go to war.
  Cut scene to Peter at the House of Representatives.
  Man at Podium: There is no just cause for an invasion of Iraq.
  Peter: Well that may be, but what we're all forgetting is anyone who
  doesn't want to go to war, is gay.
  Congressman #1: I want to go to war.
  All of Congress: Oh yes, yes yes yes, (ect.)
  Speaker of the House: I was the first one who wanted to go to war!
  Cut back to Peter who looks off into the distance only to see a plane
  heading towards him.
  Peter: (while running) AAAH!
  Two priets apprehend Lois
  Lois: Aaaah! Peter!
  Peter: Lois!
  Plane takes off leaving behind a note.
  The note says: Bring the film to my house on the top of Mount Rushmore
  in three days, or your wife dies --M. Gibson (camera pans down) Also,
  don't miss "Bird on a Wire", Tuesday night on TBS Superstation." (The
  letter is in all caps).
  Cut to Mount Rushmore, zooming in on Mel Gibsons home.
  Mel Gibson: Don't take this personally Mrs. Griffin. I'm doing this
  because I have to.
  Lois: What are you gonna do? (in suductive tone) Oh, what are you gonna
  do to me?
  Mel Gibson: As soon as your husband gives me what I want, you're free
  to go.
  Peter busts in through the door.
  Peter: Anybody home?
  Lois: *gasp* Peter!
  Peter: All right, Gibson I want my wife back...or a woman of equal
  physical attractiveness.
  Mel Gibson: Where's the film?
  Peter throws film to Gibsons feet.
  Peter: Come on, honey let's get out of here.
  Lois: Peter you're just going to give him the film?
  Peter: Don't worry Lois there's a dog turd in there, but by the time he
  finds out well be long go--
  Mel Gibson: There's a dog turd in here.
  Peter: Uh-oh. Lois...
  Lois: What?
  Peter: Jump!
  Peter and Lois jump out a glass window
  Peter & Lois: Aaaah!
  Cut back to Mel Gibson as his two priest goons prepare to chase Peter
  & Lois
  Mel Gibson: No, wait! I'll deal with them myself.
  Pulls out gun and fires the lock off the a safe. Drops gun only to open
  safe and withdraw another gun.
  Cut to Peter & Lois on top of Mount Rushmore
  Lois: We're on top of the monument.
  Peter: Holy crap!
  Mel Gibson fires towards them.
  Peter & Lois: Ah!
  Peter & Lois begin to scale down Mount Rushmore only to be
  fired at again.
  Peter: You know I know this is the wrong time to be starstruck but, Mel
  Gibson is shooting at us.
  Lois falls while screaming barely grasping hold of George Washingtons
  upper lip.
  Lois: Peter help!
  Peter:Aw, man. I'm comin' Lois.
  Peter begins to dangle on George Washingtons nose.
  Peter: Heheheheh. Look, Lois im a booger. Hehhehe.
  Lois: Peter for god's sake.
  Peter: Ok, Ok, grab my hand.
  Mel Gibson appears and cocks his gun.
  Peter & Lois: *gasp*
  Mel Gibson: And now Mr Griffin, I want that film.
  Peter: Oh sure it's right over there in President Rushmore's mouth.
  Mel Gibson turns and walks over the edge falling to his death.
  Lois: Oh my god, he just walked right over the edge.
  Peter: Of course he did, Christians don't believe in gravity.
  Peter & Lois climb back to the top of Mount Rushmore.
  Lois: Peter it's back.
  Peter: What that rash?
  Lois: No no the spark. Honey I have never been more attracted to you
  than I am right now.
  Peter: Really wow, so I guess this honeymoon was just the kind of
  excitement our marriage needed. I guess it just goes to show that...
  Lois: Shutup and let's do it.
  Camera pans out to full view of Mount Rushmore.
  Lois: Oh, oh, oh Peter!
  Peter: YES!
  George Washington: Hey Jefferson check it out. Chick gettin nailed on
  my head.
  Thomas Jefferson: Sweet. Hey Teddy pass the word down to Frankenstein.
  Abraham Lincolin: Oh ha ha.
  Back to the Griffin house where Meg, Brian & Stewie are
  watching TV.
  Tom Tucker: In local news a Buddy Cianci Jr. high school student has
  been arrested for possession of drugs. The student has been sentenced
  to 200 hours of community service and is a very bad boy. We now go to
  Ollie Williams for the punishment forecast. Ollie.
  Ollie Williams: HE GON GET IT!
  Tom Tucker: Thanks Ollie. Now this.
  Back in the livingroom.
  Meg: So you actually put coke in that kid's locker?
  Brian: Yup.
  Meg: Wow, where'd you get it.
  Brian: Oh I got a guy.
  Greased-up deaf guy enters.
  Greased-up deaf guy: Dont let it get the best of you. I used to be a
  lawyer. See you next week. Good to be back, America.



Title: Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High

NARRATOR: In the television comedy world, the people are
  entertained...
  by two separate yet equally important types of shows.
  Traditional sitcoms that get laughs out of everyday
  situations...
  like trying to fix your own plumbing or inviting two dates to
  the same dance.
  And animated shows that make jokes about farting. This is the
  latter.
  Sorry. I just farted.
  [Law & Order theme song]
  I'm glad you guys could come tonight.
  Chris, honey, we wouldn't miss your open house.
  You kids are the most important thing in our lives.
  Oh, my God! We forgot Meg.
  Don't worry about Meg. She's got everything she needs in her room.
  Most of the time, the kids'll exercise out in the field.
  But if it's raining or I'm hung-over, they stay inside and play dodge
  ball.
  I love dodge ball! Heads up!
  And this week in Home Ec, we're teaching your kids...
  how to make bundt cake.
  I love bundt cake! Heads up!
  The school band offers a wide variety of instruments...
  from the kettledrum to the trombone.
  I love the trombone!
  [Playing soulful tune]
  Wow!
  I know, isn't he wonderful? He took lessons in junior college.
  Heads up!
  I like meeting Chris's teachers. This ought to be more interesting
  than...
  that time I met Ted Danson.
  Wow! Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen!
  Always nice to meet a fan.
  Oh, shoot! I forgot my umbrella.
  That's okay, honey. Come on over here.
  Thanks, dear.
  Sometimes it's good to be a freak. Do you want to sleep together later?
  No. Thanks, though.
  Good evening, parents. I'm Ms. Clifton. I'd like for you to fill out
  these...
  contact information sheets. Now, who would like to pass them out?
  Ms. Clifton, over here!
  Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton!
  Mrs. Griffin.
  I'm sorry. Will you all please excuse me for a moment?
  MAN: [On TV] Tonight's winning lottery numbers are...
  6, 21, 18, 7, 42.
  Oh, my God! I won!
  I'm free from all those snot-nosed, little bastards!
  I'm free!
  [Ms. Clifton laughing maniacally]
  - Is she coming back? - I don't know.
  [Audience laughing]
  I can't believe Ms. Clifton's gone. Who's gonna teach my class now?
  Brian, why don't you teach Chris's class?
  You're very knowledgeable, the kids might knock you down a few pegs...
  which would be good for you.
  You know, that is a terrific idea, Lois. I probably have a lot to offer
  young people.
  What's he going to teach them?
  How to lick the Dorito crumbs from between the sofa cushions?
  Or how to leave a dead bird on the carpet?
  That was a gift, you bastard.
  That was a gift for the family.
  Good morning, class. I'm your substitute teacher, Brian Griffin.
  Good morning, Mr. Griffin.
  Please. Call me Brian. Mr. Griffin is my father.
  I thought your father's name was Cocoa, and he was hit by a milk truck!
  All right. Our goal here is to gain a command of the English language.
  So you can be successful writers like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
  There. Finished. Good Will Hunting by Matt Damon.
  You think we could put both our names on that?
  What? You've done nothing but eat Breyer's and smoke pot...
  for the last six months.
  Oh, that's... Come on! I helped.
  Oh, yeah? Okay, write a line. Just right now.
  - Just pitch me a line right now. - Okay.
  [Farts]
  How about that?
  - That wasn't a line. You just farted. - Is there anymore pot?
  So, how was your first day, Mr. Kotter?
  Yeah, Chris. What's it like to have Brian as a teacher?
  It sucks! Mr. Griffin gave me an F on my first assignment!
  What? An F, Brian? After all Chris has done for you?
  Yeah. Just kind of pull it out. Yeah.
  If dogs aren't supposed to eat dental floss out of the garbage...
  why do they make it mint-flavored?
  Chris, when I was in school, you know what we used to do...
  when a teacher gave us a bad grade?
  - What? - We'd egg his house.
  - Come on. Where's this bastard live? - I'll show you.
  That's his house!
  - Take that! - I got it!
  Take that, you bum!
  What the hell are you doing?
  - Is that him? - Yeah!
  Oh, crap!
  [In Southern accent] Hello, class. Mark Twain here, filling in for
  Brian Griffin.
  I understand you children read my book, The Adventures of
  Huckleberry Finn.
  Yeah, we read it.
  Now, who can tell me... Bobby, stop screwing around back there!
  Who can tell me the significance of the carpetbaggers in my novel?
  Yeah. They stood for corruption and greed.
  That's exactly right. Just like the presidency of James Garfield.
  He died in office.
  You kids are mighty smart. You must have a powerful good teacher.
  Well, I gotta catch my time steamboat back to the 1800s.
  - Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? - Yeah! Cap'n Crunch was here.
  Didn't you pass him on the stairs?
  Well, I hope the rest of you kids learned something today.
  Yeah.
  [Over P.A. system] Good morning, this is Principal Sloan.
  Mr. Griffin, you've been reassigned.
  Please report to Remedial English.
  Reassigned? Can I at least come down to your office and talk to you
  about this?
  No. I'm afraid I'm far too busy today.
  Estoban, mucho tension lower.
  Little lower. Lower.
  Lower.
  [Singing in shrill voice] On top of old Smokey
  Gosh, I was really starting to like this job.
  It was nice interacting with intelligent people.
  I usually hang out with an idiot.
  Brian, check it out. I made a water slide in the house.
  [Groaning in pain]
  I'm not gonna call the hospital because you won't learn anything if I
  do.
  Well, kids, I'll see you later.
  Pardon me. Is this first-period English?
  I'm your new teacher, Mrs. Lockhart.
  Oh, my God. I'm in love.
  Watch out for the stairs!
  [Crashing]
  - Good morning, class. - Good morning, Mrs. Lockhart.
  I graded your quizzes from yesterday. Most of you did well.
  Some of you, I think, can do better. What do you see here, Chris?
  Two D's and an F.
  [Funky instrumental music playing]
  Hi. I'm Mr. Griffin. But you can call me Brian.
  Mr. Griffin is my father.
  [Gunshot]
  Well, has anybody read Huckleberry Finn?
  All right. How about we go around the room and everyone can say...
  a little something about themselves?
  Let's start with you there in the front.
  My name's Tim. I'm 28 years young.
  And I love weed.
  My name is Carlos. And beneath my tough exterior is a boy aching to
  learn.
  And beneath that is a rapist.
  My name is Amanda. And my water just broke.
  - Oh, my God! - Yo, it's my turn to deliver.
  Can I have this one? My mom keeps giving mine away.
  Dad, I need some advice. I need to know how to get a girl to like me.
  Chris, buddy, there's a million ways to do that.
  You just got to do something simple, like Vincent van Gogh.
  It's... What is this?
  It's my ear. Do you like it?
  You don't like it.
  No, I like it. But it's just... Why your ear?
  Because I love you.
  Well, at least this will be a funny story to tell our kids someday.
  You want kids? Oh, yikes.
  I wish you'd told me that before I got you this.
  Did I hear my big boy say he's got a crush on some lucky girl?
  You know, Chris, I knew this day would come. So, I brought you a condom.
  Use it wisely, though. It wasn't easy to obtain.
  [Man and woman moaning]
  MAN: What the hell are you doing?
  WOMAN: Give that back! MAN: Man!
  WOMAN: Now, where were we? MAN: This is much better.
  Chris, honey, the way to win a girl is to do something romantic and
  unexpected.
  Remember the naked spaceman, Lois?
  Yeah. You remember the naked spaceman.
  On my 25th birthday, your father surprised me by showing up...
  in nothing but a space helmet and moon boots.
  It just came to me.
  - You want some Tang, Mr. Spaceman? - Do I?
  Just remember, fat man, those jugs are mine until the milk dries up.
  Then you can have the remains.
  So, basically, what Orwell was saying was, "It's not perfect but I'll
  take it."
  All right, moving on...
  CHRIS: Sorry, I'm late, Mrs. Lockhart.
  Oh, my God, Chris! What are you doing?
  Being romantic and unexpected.
  Chris, you can't be so impulsive.
  People have gotten into a lot of trouble that way.
  - Marie? - Yeah, Donny?
  We cannot tell Mom.
  So, Chris, what's the latest with your little girlfriend?
  I don't think Mrs. Lockhart likes me at all.
  Mrs. Lockhart? Your teacher?
  Whoa!
  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
  Lois, this is not my Batman glass.
  Peter, are you listening? Chris has a crush on his teacher.
  Gross!
  You know what else is gross?
  [Farts]
  Broke a damn blood vessel!
  How's it coming, dog?
  God! Just listen to this kid's report on Great Expectations.
"Miss Havisham should have throwed that cake out so it don't like...
"mess all up the bitch's house."
I don't know what to do, you know? Society's given up on these kids.
I feel like I may be the only one who can help them.
I think your problem is you're not communicating in a way...
that speaks to their experience.
You know what you should do?
Get in there tomorrow and do the robot.
Wow. You know, you're right. Maybe I should just try...
a whole new approach. Thanks.
[Funky music playing on stereo]
Okay, you can stop that now.
I can't hear you. I'm a robot.
- Come on, knock it off. - Does not compute.
- I'm going to bed. - I do not require sleep.
Let's see the kid with the hearing aid from Barney do this.
All right. So's I'm chilling in Verona when my homie busts out with:
"Yo, Romeo. Check out that biotch Juliet in the window."
Problem is, Juliet's peeps are, like, East Coast rappers...
and my posse's representing West Side.
Just like my boys Tupac and Biggie. Know what I'm saying?
- That's racist, man. - Yeah, that's just straight ignorant, dog.
It's good to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
We wanted to talk to you about our son. You see, Chris really...
Lois, honey, let's make sure we do this delicately, all right?
Mrs. Lockhart, our son...
would like to plow you.
I had a feeling that's what was going on.
Sorry. Our son can sometimes be a boob. I mean a melon.
I mean, a sopping-wet pair of breasts barely covered by a racing
  t-shirt.
  Mrs. Lockhart, we just wanted you to know...
  so you could spare his feelings and let him down gently.
  Don't worry. I know exactly what to say to Chris.
  Thank you so much. You've been very understanding.
  Gosh. You know, I don't mean to impose, but do you have a picture of
  yourself...
  that I could tape to the back of Lois's head?
  [Rapping on window]
  - Mrs. Lockhart? - Chris, come down here.
  I need to talk to you.
  Why are you here?
  'Cause I couldn't stand to be away from you for another moment.
  I think I'm falling in love with you.
  - I love you, too! - The only problem is I'm married.
  Therefore, there's only one thing to do.
  Make a flip book of a stick figure whose head gets bigger and bigger...
  and bigger and then pops?
  This isn't a flip book, Chris. They're instructions.
  If we're going to be together, I need you to kill my husband.
  Do you have any idea what time it is?
  Get in the house, fatty!
  Chris, you big beautiful man, I'm so glad you came.
  Up the stairs, second door on the left. He should still be asleep.
  - Mrs. Lockhart, I don't think I can do this. - What?
  Maybe you could just get a divorce, and we could live together...
  in the fort under my bed.
  Fine. I'll do it myself. But we're through.
  Okay. But I got to give you the password, or you can't get into the
  fort.
  [Door bangs shut]
  It's taco. Taco!
  Good God! Look at the fat man's underwear.
  It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting. Don't put that in with my
  things!
  What's this?
  You know, Stewie, Mommy doesn't usually read things out of Chris's
  pockets.
  She's more respectful than that.
  Yeah, whatever helps you sleep at night, bitch.
  Oh, my God!
  Chris is gonna murder Mrs. Lockhart's husband!
  We got to stop him!
  Can we stop at the supermarket? I want a Granny Smith apple.
  How's your oatmeal, honey?
  You know, it tastes kind of different than usual.
  Oh, my God! There's a bear in my oatmeal.
  [Mr. Lockhart screaming]
  [Bear growling]
  Yeah, I know. I'm late. Okay, let's just get started.
  Yo, man, what's that thing in the middle?
  What, this? You got to be freaking kidding me.
  That's an ampersand. It's a symbol for the word "and."
  My God, nobody can be this stupid. Not even Peter when he took...
  that blow to the head and thought he was Larry from Three's
  Company.
  Jack, there's a hot tub party across the street and we're invited.
  And don't worry. If Mr. Furley comes by, I'll make sure he thinks
  you're...
  Mr. Griffin, chillax. We're doing the best we can.
  There is nothing I would like to do more than chillax, Amanda.
  But without a decent education, you could spend the rest of your life...
  as a ditch digger or a motel maid or a hooker.
  - I could be a ditch digger? - A motel maid?
  I could be a hooker?
  Well, no. You don't want to be a hooker.
  Wow, Mr. Griffin! You're the first teacher that ever told us we could
  do anything.
  Well, I didn't mean sell your body for money.
"O, Captain! my Captain!"
No, you're actually misunderstanding.
"O, Captain! my Captain!"
Well, if it works for you, I guess...
"O, Captain! my Captain!"
What the hell? Be the best damn hooker you can be.
"O, Captain! my Captain!"
In your case, I'd get the money up front.
[Groaning]
Jack, twins! Swedish. My place. Now.
We're too late! Oh, my God.
Okay, I gotta call the police.
What's that smell?
Dead body, right. That's what that is.
I just had a dream I was an egg, and I was being hatched by Elisabeth
  Hasselbeck.
  No, wait a minute. I can't call the police.
  I have to get rid of this body, or Chris'll go to prison!
  And we all know what happens in those prison showers. I've
  seen Oz.
  [Singing]Scrub scrub here, scrub scrub there
  Whether you're white or bronze
  A man can wash another man in the merry old land of Oz
  All right, wait here, Stewie, while Mommy gets the cement blocks.
  - Everything all right here? - Fine, Officer. Just enjoying the sunset.
  No law against that, is there?
  - What happened to your shirt? - You know, just a pizza party at the
  office.
  Yeah? Where do you work?
  First Fidelity Insurance over on Wabossette Street.
  - My cousin, Arnie, works over there. - Arnie's your cousin, is he?
  - You know him? - Somewhat.
  Good middle-management type. Just blends in with the furniture there.
  Never really wowed anyone at the office.
  Yeah, that's always been Arnie's problem. Well, take it easy.
  Yes. You, too. And if you see Arnie, tell him:
  [Gibbering]
  He'll know what it means.
  You know what I hate? A guy in a blue suit.
  [Exclaims]
  There's one right behind me, isn't there?
  You know, Lois, Chris is cool and everything, but since he killed that
  guy...
  I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't be living with us here now.
  Peter, I'm scared.
  Don't worry, sweetheart. You'll have plenty of time to escape...
  while he's killing Meg. He hates her the most.
  Hey, everybody. What's for dinner? I'm starving.
  My God, his blood lust is unquenchable!
  Chris, why don't you take your sister into the kitchen for a sandwich?
  I don't want to die!
  Why is everybody acting weird?
  Chris, honey, we know what you did.
  And I have to say, honestly, I don't approve.
  What I did? That I lied about my age to get into Indian Bingo?
  No.
  That I had hard gas and pooed myself?
  Close, but still no.
  How is that close?
  For God's sake, Chris! You murdered Mr. Lockhart!
  What? No, I didn't!
  Come on. Everybody's done something they're not proud of.
  Like when I used to be a Wonder Twin.
  Peter, the old schoolhouse is on fire! Let's go!
  Wonder Twin powers, activate!
  Form of a hawk!
  - Come on, Peter. - Yeah, I'll be right behind you.
  Shape of Jayna's tampon.
  PETER: And now I play the waiting game.
  Chris, I saw the body.
  Premeditated murder is one thing, but I will not have lying in this
  house.
  Wait, hold it. Can we finish this after Joan of Arcadia?
  Is Joan of Arcadia on?
  All right.
  Must be good.
  Enjoyable program.
  We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a breaking news story.
  We apologize to Joan of Arcadia's sanctimonious, fear-based...
  and probably overweight viewers.
  That's right, Diane. It appears Ronald Lockhart...
  has been brutally murdered by his wife, Lana, and a local bear.
  Well, I'll be damned. Chris, I guess we owe you an apology.
  That's okay. I just wonder what happened to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.
  The whereabouts of these suspects are currently unknown.
  - You ready? - What's that?
  I thought we'd try that lobster place we passed in the car.
  - Yeah, can I just finish watching this? - You can watch TV anytime.
  I'm starving.
  Lana, this is gonna be a real long trip if you don't knock off the crap!
  Love you.



Title: Blind Ambition

Theme Song
  Cleveland: I must say, I do feel a strange satisfaction watching the
  black ball topple all those self-righteous white pins.
  Joe: Can't blame them for being self-righteous. The black ball's in
  their neighborhood uninvited.
  Cleveland: The black ball's done nothing wrong.
  Joe: If the black ball's innocent, it has nothing to fear.
  Peter looks at the bowling ball returner.
  Peter: Huh. Wonder what the hell's down there. Peter sticks his head
  inside. Judd Hirsch?
  Judd Hirsch: Uh... hey.
  Peter: What, uh... What's goin' on?
  Judd Hirsch: Nothin'.
  Peter: All right.
  Lois: Hi, boys! Your ride is here.
  Peter: Hey, you're just in time. Mort's one ball away from a perfect
  game.
  Mort: Oh, God, the pressure's too much. I just lost control of my
  bladder. Oh, why didn't I clothespin the end of my penis like Muriel
  told me to?
  Cleveland: Oh, my God, you bowled a perfect game.
  Group: Mort!
  Joe: Grr-yeah!
  Group: All right, Mort!
  Mort: I just never stopped believing. Say no to acid!
  Peter: Geez, relax, Mort. You'd think you were God Himself.
  Mort: No, He's over there.
  God: Hey. You wanna see what I can do? All right, ready? Check it out.
  Beer. Glass. All right? Now watch this. Oh, Hey, guess I'll go over
  here for a minute. (Humming) Oh, holy crap, that's still pouring
  itself. Oh, wow. Oh, that's amazing. I've never seen anyone do that.
  You wanna go out later?
  Lois: I'll be right back. I'm gonna go tinkle.
  Peter: Okay, everybody ready? Hey, where's Quagmire? In the bathroom.
  Lois searches for a toilet seat cover but there are none. She has to
  use toilet paper instead.
  Quagmire: giggety-gig... Gig-gig-giggy. Giggety-gig, gig, giggety,
  giggety. (Groaning) Would you just sit down and go to the bathroom,
  already?!
  Lois looks up.(Shrieks)
  Diane Simmons: A scandal at the Quahog Bowling Alley tonight, where a
  local man, Glenn Quagmire, was charged with peeping in the ladies' room.
  Tom Tucker: Coming up: Diane's weight.
  Officer: He's all yours, Joe.
  Joe: You know, you're lucky I've got some extra pull around here thanks
  to my eighteen medals for heroism.
  Peter: Sheesh, there he goes again with the medals. Hey, Joe, if you
  love your medals so much, why don't you marry 'em? (Chuckles) I-I did
  something like that once.
  Cut Scene. Peter is talking to a lawyer.
  Lawyer: And in the event of your death, you'd like the insurance policy
  to be paid to your wife?
  Peter: Yep.
  Lawyer: And your wife is this piece of pie?
  Peter: You got it. Love you.
  Lawyer: Okay... sign here.
  Peter has pie on his face.
  Peter: You know what? You can probably go ahead and cancel that.
  End Cut Scene
  Lois: Well, well, look who's here.
  Peter: All right, all right. Look, I know an apology is due here. So,
  Lois, tell Quagmire you're sorry you had him arrested.
  Lois: Excuse me? He's the one who owes me an apology. He was watching
  me go to the bathroom!
  Peter: Well, clearly he thinks you're attractive, Lois. It's a positive
  thing. Thank you, Glenn, for complimenting our family.
  Loretta: We have had it with his disrespect for women. We're
  petitioning the city to have him removed from the neighborhood.
  Bonnie: Yeah. I don't want to bring a new baby into the world with him
  running around.
  Peter: Okay, first of all, Bonnie, you've been pregnant for, like, six
  years, all right, either have the baby or don't. Second of all,
  Quagmire's a good guy. He's just a little mixed up.
  A giant chicken leaps at Peter from off-screen and attacks him.
  The two engage in a fist fight down Spooner Street.
  ...
  Man: This isn't medium-rare.
  Woman: Then have them take it back.
  Peter and the chicken fall through the glass ceiling. ...
  Peter protects himself as the propeller approaches the chicken. The
  chicken turns around and yells and is struck by the propeller. Peter
  walks away into the horizon, and the chicken's talon twitches.
  Peter: Sorry about that. Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy. You
  know, he's just a little mixed up, that's all. Come on, give him
  another chance, yeah?
  Lois: All right, but one more incident like the one at the bowling
  alley, and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood.
  Peter: Now don't worry about a thing, Quagmire. Your pals are gonna
  help you change your ways.
  Quagmire: I don't know, Peter. I'm not sure I can do this. He sees
  trees and things transform into beautiful women. Then he sees Meg. Meg,
  get out of the way. A fire hydrant turns into a beautiful woman.
  Cleveland: All right, Glenn, this exercise should help teach you
  self-control.
  Joe: Here's this month's Victoria's Secret catalogue.
  Quagmire: Oh, God! Oh, God! Uh, uh, uh, dead kittens, dead kittens! Uh,
  old nuns. Really old nuns. Uh, Renee Zellweger! Oh, there we go.
  Peter: Heyyy, good, good, good.
  Joe: Uh, yeah.
  Lois: Peter, are you sure Quagmire is ready to be out in public?
  Peter: Nothing to worry about, Lois. We figured out a foolproof
  rehabilitation method. I got the idea from when Brian had to wear that
  cone after his operation.
  Stewie: Okay, okay. If I make this, we're all gonna get laid... ha-ha!
  Yes! Score! Score!
  Brian: Boy, I'd really like to chew on my crotch right now.
  Peter: Okay, Quagmire, time to take off your training wheels.
  Quagmire: *Sighs* OK. I think I'm ready. Quagmire sees lots of
  attractive girls in the mall. He groans. Oh, boy.
  Peter: What's the matter, Glenn?
  Quagmire: Uh... nothing.
  Three cheerleaders are standing by a fountain.
  Cheerleader: Oh, Stacey, you dropped your pom-pom in the water.
  Second cheerleader: I'll get it for you.
  Stacey: I'll come with you.
  Cheerleader: Me, too.
  Second Cheerleader: But wait a minute. We don't want to get our
  sweaters all wet. Better take 'em off.
  The three lift their sweaters off.
  Stacey: Splash fight!
  They splash each other and begin kissing.
  Quagmire: *moans* I-I need... I need some air! I need some air!
  (panting) (screams) Naked plastic chicks! (screams) Where... Where am
  I? Am I dead?
  Security Guard: No, this is where we monitor all the dressing rooms in
  the mall, so we can keep an eye out for shoplifters.
  Quagmire: You don't say. Oh my God, that one's having a heart attack!
  (coughing) That was amazing! You saved her life!
  Thank God you know CPR!
  Quagmire: What the hell's CPR?
  Horace: Congratulations, Quagmire. You're the newest member of my Wall
  of Fame.
  Joe: What's wrong, Peter?
  Peter: Oh, it's nothing, Joe. It's... I dunno... it's just that... all
  you guys have something to be Proud of, you know? Quagmire got a key to
  the city. Mort bowled a perfect game. You're always getting medals for
  catchin' crooks. Hell, even Cleveland used to be an accomplished
  auctioneer.
  Cleveland: very rapidly I have 125. Do I hear 130? 130,000 For this
  authentic Comanche headdress? I got one-30. I got one-30. Do I hear
  one-35? One-40. Do I hear one-for...? An assistant knocks over a totem
  pole whic knocks Cleveland in the head. He changes to a slow monotone.
  One-35 going once.
  Peter: I'm the only one here who's got nothin'. You know, if I died
  tomorrow, there's nothin' people would remember me for.
  Cleveland: Not if you jumped off a skyscraper and landed on Joan
  Cusack. People would say, "Hey, remember that guy who landed on Joan
  Cusack?"
  Peter: Well, things are gonna change. From this day forth, people are
  gonna know the name Peter Griffin. Even If I have to shout it from the
  rooftops. On the roof of The Drunken Clam You hear that, world?! I am
  gonna do something that people will remember me for! He loses his
  balance and falls over the edge. Whoa! Oh, oh, God. Sorry, sorry...
  Hey! Joan Cusack! Hello? Uh-oh. He stuffs Joan Cusack's body in a
  mailbox and walks away.
  Brian: Peter, If you just let me talk, I'll explain to you why you
  shouldn't do this.
  Peter: Later, later, Brian. I gotta do something people will remember
  me for. Which is why I've invented a new type of flying machine.
  Stewie: You know, I vaguely recall seeing footage somewhere of
  something exactly like this that, uh... leads me to believe this
  probably won't work.
  Peter: All right, stewie, let 'er rip!
  Stewie starts the flying machine. I crashes and he goes flying into a
  tree. He views Keebler elves.
  Elves: Ya! All right, we attack the Rice Krispy guys at dawn. Assuming
  Judd Hirsch delivers the goods.
  Peter: Brian, this time I think I got just the thing people will
  remember me for. I am gonna stop pollution with my new, lovable
  character, Gary the No-trash Cougar. Yelling: pick up your trash!
  screaming: I wanna know whose cup this is! I said, I wanna know whose
  cup this is! A frightened girl timidly raises her hand. Pick it up!
  Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up! gently: Thank you, sweetie. See
  what a nicer place this is when we all pitch in? Like Gary the No-trash
  Cougar says: give a larbage, throw out your garbage. Spread the word!
  He fires his gun into the air and leaves the room.
  Pop: Those freakin' elves, man. They just came out of the trees, man.
  They just came out of the trees.
  Crackle: You saved my ass back there.
  Pop: You saved mine.
  Crackle: Here's to Snap.
  Crackle: To Snap.
  Peter: Ah, this sucks. I've been workin' on this all week and I keep
  comin' up dry. Who am I kiddin'? I'm never gonna be remembered for
  anything. Not like my great, great uncles, the siamese twins who fought
  each other in the Civil War.
  Cut Scene. Two Griffins are attached at the hip, one in Union regalia
  and one in Confederate eregalia.
  Uncle 1: I'm seceding!
  Uncle 2: Like hell you are!
  Uncle 2 shoots Uncle 1. The next scene is 5 years later. The skeleton
  of Uncle 1 is still attached to Uncle 2.
  Barkeeper: Not too smart, huh?
  Uncle 2: Yeah. Did not think that one through.
  Cut back to the bar.
  Cleveland:Peter, you have to stop comparing yourself to other people
  and find out what's special about you.
  'Tom Tucker: (on TV) In sadder news, the man who held the Guinness
  World Record for most drugs ever done by a single human being died
  today. He was attacked by a pack of wild dogs... he thought he saw.
  Mort: Ooh, there you go, Peter. You could break a world record.
  Peter: What are you, nuts? I got no special talents. What can I do that
  nobody else does?
  Horace the Bartender: Well, you just ate my tip.
  Peter: I got it!
  Cut to the Griffin family driving in the car. Peter begins to swallow a
  roll of nickels
  Lois: Peter, you're really putting away those Mentos.
  Peter: Oh, these aren't Mentos, Lois. Everybody, you're lookin' at a
  guy who's gonna set a new world record. I am gonna eat more nickels
  than anyone has ever eaten before! Settin' this world record is gonna
  make me famous. Just like the world's fattest twins over there.
  Right Fat Twin: Did I tell you that I'm doing Atkins?
  Left Fat Twin: Oh, that's not good for you.
  Cut to Griffins at home.
  Peter begins to shake his stomach rhythmically.
  Meg: Dad, I just don't hear it.
  Peter: C'mon!
  Brian: Really, Peter. It just doesn't...
  Peter: You're telling me that doesn't sound like "Camptown Races"?!
  Brian: Not one bit.
  Chris: (Laughs) Do "Short People."
  Stewie: Ugh, this is the worst use of money since I tricked out my big
  wheel.
  Cut to a playground with two girls playing hopscotch. Bass-heavy rap
  music begins to play as Stewie rides up on his big wheel with a massive
  speaker attached to the back. The big wheel then begins to act as
  though it has hydraulics.
  Stewie: Hey, ladies! Check out this ride! Huh?! Yeah! I'm off to make
  trouble for the establishment!
  Back to the Griffin home, outside Peter and Lois's room.
  Peter: I love you, Lois.
  Lois: Ooo, I love you too Peter. Even if you are full of nickels.
  Coins begin to jingle rhythmically, steadily they begin to get faster
  and faster until suddenly they stop.)
  Peter: Good night, honey.
  Coins jingle once more
  Peters alarm clock goes off, Peter reaches over to turn it off. Peter
  then opens his eyes, a worried look appears on is face as he gets out
  of bed and begins to wave his hands infront of his face
  Peter: Oh my God! Lois! I can't see!
  Cut to the Health Care Center.
  Dr. Hartman: Uh, how about now?
  Peter: No, nothin'.
  Dr. Hartman: Well, that makes me feel much better. You can't see the
  spaceship, either. My cousin Marshall insists if you look past the
  picture, you can see a spaceship...
  Lois: Can you please just tell us what's wrong with my husband?
  Dr. Hartman: Oh, yes. Uh, well, you see, after ingesting such a large
  number of metal coins, Mr. Griffin appears to have succumbed to nickel
  poisoning, causing him to lose his sight.
  Peter: Oh my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat! I can't see a damn thing.
  Tumbler Man: You know what else you can't see? The writing on the wall.
  Vaudeville's dead. And TV's the box they're gonna bury it in. Back
  then, everybody had a specialty. I, for one, am a tumbler. Watch me
  leap through this big hoop.
  The Tumbler Man holds up a big hoop and attempts to tumble through it
  only to fall flat on his face
  Tumbler Man: Vamp, vamp!
  Camera pans to the other side of the room revealing a piano with a
  pianist who beings to play ragtime music
  Lois: So we're all gonna have to pitch in and help your father out, now
  that he's lost his sight.
  Meg: Nobody took care of me when I lost my arms and legs and was struck
  blind, deaf and dumb.
  Cut to Peter & Meg on the couch, Meg without arms or legs.
  Peter: Hey, Hey, Meg, they got a Happy Days spoof in here, but they
  call it Crappy Days. (Laughing)
  Meg contines to lay still, only twitching slightly.
  Peter: All right, you know what? If you're not gonna laugh, then I'm
  not gonna keep you company.
  Back to the current day Peter on the couch with family.
  Peter: This sucks. Now the only thing anybody's gonna remember me for
  after I die is being, "That Blind Guy."
  Brian: Don't give up yet, Peter. I mean, many blind people lead rich,
  fulfilling lives.
  Peter: Oh, I don't know, Brian. I mean, I guess I can give it a shot.
  Peter gets up to walk around. Stewie however quickly pushes a footstool
  into his path causing Peter to fall on his face
  Stewie: (Laughs) Oh my God! I almost didn't do it. I almost didn't do
  it. I thought, is this in bad taste? But you know what, I went for it.
  I went for it and I am so glad I did. Ohh, worth it, totally worth it.
  Cut to that night. Peter wanders out of the bathroom and begins to look
  for his room. Finds what he thinks is his room and enters what is
  actualy Chris's room.
  Peter: Still awake, Lois, honey?
  Chris: Dad?
  Peter: Thats right, I'm your daddy. Shh, shh, shh; don't talk, Lois,
  don't talk. Just let me do all the work. Yeah, you feel my warm breath
  on the nape of your neck? My hands on your big soft boobs, moving down
  your big man like che--
  Peter suddenly jumps out of bed
  Peter: Holy crap, it's Chris! Uh, ah, so, ah... how ya doing? You do
  all your homework? Finish all your subjects?
  Chris: Yes, sir.
  Peter: Good, Just, uh, just checkin'. Have a good night, son.
  Peter backs out of Chris's room and heads back down the hall only to
  enter another room.
  Peter: You still awake, honey?
  Stewie: What the deuce?
  Cut to the next morning.
  Brian: Peter, what the hell is that?
  Peter: Ah, this is my seeing eye dog, Brutus.
  Brian: What do you need a seeing eye dog for?
  Peter: Well, 'cause I can't do anything for myself, Brian. I can't
  drive, I don't know when to cross the street, and I took a dump in the
  church confessional, which I guess they frown upon If you're not
  homeless. I thought I could deal with being blind at first, but I don't
  know. I... I haven't felt this out of place since that week I lived
  with Superman.
  Cut to Supermans Lair
  Superman: We must stop Lex Luthor before he irradiates the world's
  supply of gold.
  Peter: Uh, Hi. Uh, sorry. I know you got a meetin' going on, but, um...
  So, we are officially running low on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-its. So, um,
  just putting it out there If you're heading to the store later. Uh...
  you know, uh... 800 mile drive for me, like, uh, five seconds for you.
  Whatever. I'm not here.
  Back in the living room.
  Brian: Peter, this is something you're still adjusting to. You can't
  expect to get used to it overnight.
  Peter: Whatever you say, Brian. I'm going to the Clam.
  Exit Peter, enter Lois
  Lois: Did Peter leave?
  Brian: Yeah. Boy, he's really down about this.
  Lois: Oh, I know. I'm so worried about him. I've been looking into
  support groups we could join to help him...
  Brian: Are you... are-are you not wearing makeup?
  Lois: Oh, no. I just... You know, since Peter went blind, it's actually
  been kinda nice not to have to worry about my appearance.
  Brian: I see.
  Lois: Is it really noticeable?
  Brian: Well, a... little mascara wouldn't kill you.
  Lois: (chuckles) I was kinda thinking I'd try an au natural thing.
  Brian: You think, uh... You think you have the skin for that?
  Cut to The Drunken Clam, a woman sits at the bar trying to light a
  cigarette.
  God: Oh, uh, let me light that for you, babe.
  God points to the tip of the cigarette as a lightnight bolt comes down
  from the sky.
  Woman: Wow.
  God: Yeah, magic fingers.
  God chuckles slyly and inadvertently points his finger at the woman,
  causing a lightning bolt to strike her, she explodes in a ball of fire
  causing the bar to catch fire.
  God: Jesus Christ!
  Jesus: What?
  God: Get the Escalade. We're outta here.
  Everyone runs out of the bar screaming as Peter arrives. Brutus (Peters
  seeing eye dog) attempts to pull Peter away from the burning building.
  Peter: Come on, girl. I'm thirsty.
  Brutus:(barks)
  Peter: All right, you don't wanna come in? Fine. I'll just tie you to
  this parking meter.
  Peter ties Brutus to a homeless man. As Peter enters the bar a car
  drives by with another dog inside. The dog in the car barks at Brutus
  causing Brutus to chase after the car, dragging the yelling homeless
  man along
  Back inside the bar Peter sits down at a bar stool. The camera shows
  Horace trapped under a fallen wooden beam.
  Peter: Hey, Horace. Um, I'll have a Pawtucket Patriot.
  Horace: (groaning)
  Peter: So, how's your hammer hanging? (sniffing) Hey, somebody smokin'
  in here? Huh. Oh, hey, y-you ever watch that show "Scrubs"? Yeah, Lois
  had it on the other night, and I was kinda fading in and out, but, uh,
  you know, I was watchin' and I'm wonderin'... Which one is the funny
  guy?
  Horace: (Grunts) Peter, grab my hand!
  Peter: Geez, Horace, you been drinkin'?
  Horace: Grab it and pull! Come on! Let's go!
  Peter pulls Horace from under the reckage and takes him outside to
  onlooking reporters.
  Tom Tucker: And here comes the heroic blind man. Tell us, sir, how did
  you summon the courage to save your friend from that burning building?
  Peter: That freakin' place was on fire?!
  Tom Tucker: And there you have it. Coming up next... Watch me shave.
  Peter wanders over towards Lois & Brian.
  Lois: Oh! Peter, you're all right! Oh, I am so proud of you for saving
  Horace's life.
  Brian: Yeah, Peter, you were amazing.
  Peter: Huh. You know, Brian, I guess I was. And you know what else?
  People are gonna remember me for this.
  Cut to award ceremony where music similar to that of the Star Wars: A
  New Hope ending theme is playing. Peter begins walking towards the
  front of the audience with Chewbacca at his side. Chewbacca turns and
  growls at Mort Goldman, Mort cringes. Peter and Chewbacca contine to
  walk towards Mayor Adam West and Lois. Peter reaches Mayor Adam West
  where the two exchange glances. Peter continues by exchanging glances
  with Lois and then once more by exchaning glances with C3PO. Peter nods
  and bends down to recieve his medal from Adam West. Camera cuts back to
  C3PO who now has R2D2 at his side. R2D2 makes his standard set of
  noises causing Peter to laugh. Camera zooms out to show C3PO, R2D2,
  Lois, Peter, Mayor Adam West & Chewbacca. Chewbacca growls once
  more. The audiance in attendance begins clapping and the music begins
  to draw to a close. Credits roll in iconistic Star Wars fashion.



Title: Don't Make Me Over

Theme Song
  Meg's Friend: There's Craig Hoffman! He's such a rebel.
  Meg: Oh my God, he so gorgeous! And he plays by no one's rules but his
  own.
  Meg's Other Friend: Meg, you should ask him out. I mean, you're the
  only one of us who's ever had a real boyfriend.
  Cut Scene Meg approaches a deacying body accross the railroad tracks.
  Meg: I'm back. (flies buzzing) I brought another picnic. You're such a
  good listener. You're not like the other boys. A wolf approaches and
  chews off the boy's arm. You're so good with animals. End Cut Scene.
  Meg: I guess I could give it a try. All right. Here goes. She leaves
  the table and approaces Craig. Hi, Craig. Um, I was wondering if maybe
  you'd want to... I don't know, go out some time?
  Craig: Ha. That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules
  besides my own. Which I would never do. I play by my own rules. Nobody
  else's. Not even my own.
  Meg: How 'bout a movie?
  Craig: I don't go out with dudes.
  At home.
  Meg: Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
  Lois: Oh, of course not, sweetie.
  Peter: Yeah, where'd you get a stupid idea like that?
  Meg: Craig Hoffman.
  Peter: Craig... Craig Hoffman said that? Well, he's a sharp kid. You
  might be ugly.
  Meg goes into the kitchen sobbing.
  Stewie: Oh, there, there, let me dry those tears. Mmm... yes, yes. Your
  anguish sustains me.
  Lois: Meg, honey, don't let those awful kids at school make you feel
  bad about yourself. I tell you what. Tomorrow you and I are going to go
  out and get you some brand new outfits. Maybe a pair of those low-rider
  jeans that'll show off your cute butt, huh?
  Meg: Really? Wow, thanks, Mom.
  Stewie: Mmm... Meg in low riders. Pictures Meg thusly. Ugh, enough of
  that. The image returns. Go away, damn you. The image of Meg in
  lowriders returns again. Oh, you're going to get it now. Stewie takes a
  rolling pin and assaults the thought bubble.
  Peter: Oh, my God! Horace, what is this all about?
  Horace: What the hell's it look like? I'm puttin' the bar up for sale.
  Peter: Oh, please tell me this is some kind of practical joke. Like,
  like the kind I used to play when I was an intern at the hospital.
  Cut Scene. Peter approaches a man in the waiting room.
  Peter: I'm afraid I have some very bad news. Your wife's gonna be a
  vegetable. You'll have to bathe her, feed her and care for her the rest
  of her life.
  Man: Oh, my God!
  Peter: (laughing): Nah, nah, nah, I'm just kidding. She's dead. End cut
  scene.
  Horace: Ever since that Mega-Mall opened across the street, it's been
  taking away all my business. They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants, 53
  bars and an indoor cattle ranch.
  Cow: I go to Baskin-Robbins every night and buy myself a little treat.
  Horace: Now, how the hell am I supposed to compete with that?
  Cleveland: You need to fix the place up. Reinvent the Clam's image. And
  we'll help ya.
  Horace: That'll take forever.
  Peter: Not if we do a 1980s fixin'-stuff-up montage.
  electro-pop music plays ? Open your eyes ? ? A helpful surprise ? ? A
  dream in disguise ? ? You know we can have it ? ? A place we can be ?
  (beeping) ? It's so good to see... ?
  Quagmire: Wow, I think we made it worse.
  Peter: Boy, I do not envy whoever has to clean that mess up.
  Lois: Brian, why don't you take Stewie while Meg and I go clothes
  shopping?
  Stewie: You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around
  the mall at my height. I say, let me get on your back.
  Brian: Oh, for God's sake.
  Stewie: Strong with the force, young Skywalker is.
  Brian: God, I don't believe this.
  Stewie: That is why you fail.
  Lois: Oh, what about this, Meg? A pink baby-tee that says "Little
  Slut." That seems pretty hip.
  Meg: I don't know if that's really me, Mom.
  Lois: Well, they've got one that says "Porn Star" and another that says
  "Sperm Dumpster." And they're all written in glitter.
  Meg: All right, all right. Give me "Sperm Dumpster."
  Lois: That's the spirit!
  Sales clerk:
  You finding everything okay?
  Lois: Yes, thank you.
  Sales clerk: Well, you just let me know if you need any...
  Meg: How do these jeans look?
  Sales clerk: AAAAAAAAAAAGGGH!!! The sales clerk douses herself in
  gasoline, ignites herself on fire and jumps out the window.
  Stewie: Ten bucks.
  Brian: Five bucks.
  Stewie: Eight bucks and I'll do it.
  Brian: Fine.
  Stewie: Running naked through the mall. Help, I've escaped from Kevin
  Spacey's basement! Help me! Returning to Brian. Ha! I am so outrageous.
  Give me the cash.
  Brian: Cold in here?
  Stewie: Nope, just really small.
  Meg: Face it, Mom. No matter what I wear I look ugly.
  Lois: Oh, Meg, you're being... that's... eh... Let's try down here.
  Tom Tucker: Coming up next: Joan Rivers speaks to us from beyond the
  grave. But first let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall where Asian
  correspondent Tricia Takanawa is handing out makeovovs.
  Tricia Takanawa: That's right, Tom. Some lucky hideous woman will be
  transformed by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society.
  Lois: Meg, that's it! You could get a makeover! Oh, that'd be just the
  thing to boost your confidence. Miss Takanawa! Miss Takanawa! Over
  here! Oh, my daughter needs a makeover like there's no freakin'
  tomorrow! The cameraman screams, douses himself in gasoline, lights
  himself on fire and jumps out the nearest window. Tricia holds the
  camera herself.
  Tricia: It looks like we've got a winner, Tom.
  Horace: Face it, The Clam is doomed.
  Peter: Aw, come on, guys. We can't give up now.
  Joe: Aw, Peter, we've tried every theme we could think of, and
  everything's failed. Especially that, that Coyote Ugly theme... Cut
  Scene. Joe, Peter, Cleveland, and Quagmire are dancing on top of the
  bar to an Irish jig. Joe hits himself in the face with his leg End Cut
  Scene.
  Horace: Ah, it's no use. This place is finished. Quagmire, go get the
  "For Sale" sign.
  Quagmire: Hey, Horace, what the hell's this?
  Horace: Eh, it's a karaoke machine. I never got around to installing it.
  Peter: A karaoke machine? Wait a minute, that's it. We'll turn this
  place into a karaoke bar! Oh, man, that's the best idea since they
  faked the moon landing.
  Cut Scene. Neil Armstrong is standing in a television studio.
  Director: Okay, cut. Neil Armstrong exits the studio.
  Passerby: Wow, Neil Armstrong. Hey, wait a minute, you're supposed to
  be on the moon. I just saw it on TV.
  Neil Armstrong: Oh, there's, uh... uh... uh... a tape delay. And, uh...
  uh, solar winds... Neil smashes the passerby in the head with his
  helmet and shoves him in his trunk. End cut scene.
  Lois: Peter... take a look at your daughter.
  Peter: Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry. I-It was 20 years ago, I'd never
  even heard the word "rubber."
  Lois: Peter, this is Meg.
  Peter: Oh.
  Meg: I got a makeover, Dad! Don't I look great?!
  Peter: Oh, Meg, honey, I always thought you were beautiful just the way
  you... laughing Oh, God, couldn't do that with a straight face!
  laughing Welcome to the family, sweetheart. Chris, go burn all Meg's
  old pictures.
  Back at the Drunken Clam.
  Mort Goldman: ? There's got to be a morning after ? ? We're moving
  closer to the shore ? ? I know we'll be there by tomorrow ? ? And we'll
  escape the darkness ? ? We won't be searching anymore. ? ? There's got
  to be a morning... ? Thank you very much.
  Cleveland: I don't understand it. This place should be jumping.
  Peter: Well, we just need to kick it up a notch. Horace, hit it.
  Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" plays ? Just a small-town girl ? ?
  Living in a lonely world ? ? She took the midnight train going anywhere

  anywhere ?

  the lyrics. But I hate baseball cards.
  Joe: ? Some will win ? ? Some will lose ? ? Some were born to sing the
  blues ?
  Quagmire: ? Oh, the movie never ends ? ? It goes on and on and on and
  on and on... ? ? Giggety-giggety-giggety-goo!
  Hey, that's Journey! (cries): Howard! (crying): Oh...! That is Journey.

Quagmire: Yeah, they loved us!
Peter: Gentlemen, this is a sign! We are gonna start our own rock band!
  Huh? Who's with me?!
  Cleveland: I'm in!
  Joe: I'm in!
  Quagmire: I'm in!
  Bill Cosby: Looks like the guys are gonna form a rock band. Maybe
  they'll learn a little something. Stick around, you just might learn
  something, too. Hey, hey, hey!
  
  Brian: You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of
  drunken idiots at a karaoke bar doesn't mean you have what it takes to
  form a band.
  Peter: Oh, Brian, you're just ants at a picnic. We're gonna be awesome.
  Brian: Wait, wait, what, what am I? I'm ants at a picnic? Is that what
  you just said? I just, I, I'm ants at a picnic? All right. Just making
  sure.
  Quagmire: Yeah, hey, sorry I'm late, fellas.
  Cleveland: Aw, cool, Glenn. You look just like Tommy Lee.
  Quagmire: Well, I figure it would be appropriate since I just found out
  I got hepatitis.
  Joe: You know, maybe we should have decided on outfits that matched.
  Now we all look like a bunch of queers.
  Peter: Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear, as long as you play
  kick-ass rock 'n' roll and do this with your tongue. Am I right, Gene?
  Gene Simmons: You got that right, Pete.
  Lois: laughing Oh, my. Hi, Gene, I didn't know you were here. All
  right, all right. Keep it in your mouth, rock star.
  Student: whistles Wow! Great job getting hot, Meg!

  Meg: Oh, hi, Craig.

  That makes you cool. Wanna hang out with us?
  Meg: Wow. Sure.
  Craig: Hey. I'm here to pick you up.
  Peter: Here we are, fellas, our first major gig.

  gay.

  Peter: What do we do?
  Quagmire: I know what I'm doing-- I'm getting outta here! Giggidy,
  giggidy, giggidy, gone!
  Peter: Uh... hey, uh, how about a funny story about Lake Wobegon? It
  was the day of the tuna hot-dish jamboree... Peter is struck by a chair.
  Lois: Oh, no, kids, your father's in trouble. I'm going up there.
  Chris: I'm coming, too, Mom. Oh, my God. The guy behind me braided my
  hair.
  Lois: Chris, grab a guitar, Brian, take the drums. Here, Stewie, play
  with this. Hands Stewie a tambourine.
  Meg: Mom, can we please just get out of here?
  Inmate: Oh, my God!
  Other Inmate: Who is she? God, I could strangle her all night long.
  Boy, that's not healthy, is it, that that's the first place I go to?
  Lois: Hit it!
  Meg: with soft accompaniment ? Cloudy skies and rain clouds ? ? Have
  come to stay ? ? Windy nights and sad sights won't go away ?
  Family: ? Sha-la-la-la-la ?
  Meg: ? But I want to be without a care ? ? Unicorns and butterflies
  everywhere ?
  Family: driving rhythm kicks in ? Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna,
  gonna ? ? Buy me a rainbow ? ? Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna

  heart ? ? It'll be all right ?
  Family: ? Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna ? ? Buy me a
  rainbow! ?
  Meg: ? Buy me a rainbow! ?
  Family: ? Rainbow! ? The inmates cheer.
  Jimmy Iovine: You guys were great! My name's Jimmy Iovine, and I'd like
  to make you filthy rich rock stars.
  Brian: Wow, you're the chairman of Interscope Records. What are you
  doing in prison?
  Jimmy: Eh, I stomped a cat to death. Listen, you guys got talent.
  Peter: Well, where do we sign?
  Jimmy: Right here on Tony's butt cheek. Tony screams. And initial here.
  Tony screams again. And here. Tony screams again. And date. Tony
  screams again.
  Peter: Oh, crap. Today's the 17th. Tony screams and collapses.
  Cut to recording studio.

  Buy me a rainbow! ? ? Rainbow! ?
  Peter: How was that, Dr. Diddy?
  Puff Daddy: Yo, that sounded smooth, y'all. I just have a couple...
  Brian: (barking) Oh, oh, oh, God. Oh, God. I am so sorry. I keep doing
  that. Oh, God, please, please forgive me. I get that from my father.
  He's from a different generation. It's, uh...
  Puff Daddy: Whatever, man.
  Brian: We, we cool? We good?
  Puff Daddy: Yeah, we're cool. Fine.
  Brian: (growling)
  Chris: Um, Mr. Doctor, if you get shot in a rap feud, can you perform
  surgery on yourself?
  Puff Daddy: Well, no, Chris, my degree is in optometry.
  Peter: All right, Dr. Diddy, I got three choices for you for the name
  of the band. Peter Griffin Starship, Peter Griffin and the Sunday
  Steppers, or Testicular Sound Express.
  Puff Daddy: I think the name is "Meg."
  Meg: Me? Why?
  Peter: Yeah, why?
  Puff Daddy: Let me explain something to you, a'ight? We gotta get her
  half-naked and put her out front, center stage, and that's gonna make
  y'all billionaires, because America loves hot, white jailbait ass.
  Peter: Wait a minute. That's the smartest thing I've ever heard anyone
  say about anything.
  Lois: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg being exploited that way.
  Meg: Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision! I want to be exploited.
  Lois: Meg, don't you talk to me like that.
  Peter: Look, Lois, I love Mealticket just as much as I love Chris and
  Stevie, but business is business. So let's get this show on the road,
  eh?
  Puff Daddy: Good. Now, I just need you to sign these...
  Brian: (barking) Oh, God. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, my God. That-that is
  not me. That's not who I am. I vote Democrat. Uh, it will not happen
  again. W-We cool? We good?
  Puff Daddy exits leaving just the Griffin Family.
  Brian: You, uh, y-you guys know I have no problem with black people,
  right?
  Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg & Stewie: Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah,
  sure.
  'Stewie: Well, you did say you hated Crooklyn.
? Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna ? ? Buy me a rainbow! ? ?
  Gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna ? ? Wrap me up in a great big
  bow ? ? The time is right its day not night, just open up your heart ?
  ? It'll be all right ?
  Montage of Meg's albums while music is playing. Her albums include,
  "It's a Family Thang", "Statutory" and "Meg on your Face". Then the
  scene fades into the family on a tour bus
  Brian: Hey, Doc. You, uh, got a minute?
  Puff Daddy: What you want, dawg?
  Brian: Uh, yeah, so, uh, hey, check it out. Uh, Stewie and I have,
  been, uh, working on some, uh, stuff of our own, and, uh, we thought
  there might be a place for us...
  Puff Daddy begins to dial on his phone
  Brian: ...to sing on the next album. Hey, uh, cool. You're busy. No
  sweat. Boy, Benson was a funny show. I'll talk to you later.
  Stewie: Well, what did he say?
  Brian: He said he'd think about it. Okay, so, uh, where were we?
  Stewie: Oh, okay.
  Stewie: ? I want to have intercourse with you, uh ooo yeah ? ?
  Intercourse with you ?
  Brian: ? Relations ?
  Stewie: ? Intercourse with you-oo-oo. ?
  Stewie: Right?
  Brian: Yeah, no, great. That sounds good.
  Stewie: All right, all right. Yeah, groovy, groovy. Now, uh, is there a
  shorter word for intercourse?
  Meg: Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.
  Lois: Excuse me, young lady?
  Meg: Did I freakin' stutter? I said-- more Skittles!
  Lois: All right, that is it, Meg. You know, ever since you got that
  makeover, you've developed a terrible attitude, and all this success
  with the family band is only making it worse.
  Meg: The "family band"? You know, maybe you haven't noticed, Lois, but
  I am the band. Right, Miss Swan?
  Miss Swan: Oh, yeah, she band. Old lady jealous.
  Lois: (sighs) Peter, we have to do something. We're losing our
  daughter. I'm worried about what's happening to her.
  Peter: Lois, Lois, this is the kind of thing that always resolves
  itself if you just ignore it. All right? W-what's more important is,
  we're living the sweet life, huh? This is even more fun than when I
  performed at the White House.
  Cut to the Oval Office.
  Man: Mr. President, I present to you, Peter Griffin.
  Peter: A-booga-booga-booga! booga-begga-begga...! Blah-blah-blah-blah.
  President: (laughing)
  Peter: (raspberries)
  President: (laughing)
  President begins to wave hands around in excitment and inturn knocks a
  snowglobe off the desk causing it to break.
  President: (sobbing)
  Cut back to tour bus.
  Puff Daddy: Okay, listen up, everybody, I got great news. Meg, you and
  your family are gonna perform on Saturday Night Live.
  Peter: You mean I'm going to get to meet John Belushi and Gilda Radner
  and Phil Hartman and Chris Farley and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!
  Cut to Saturday Night Live Studio
  Chris: Wow, Saturday Night Live. I can't think of anything more
  exciting!
  Chris begins to eye a water fountain
  Chris: Ooh. Oh, my God! A water fountain!
  Chris starts playing with the fountain and laughing
  Jimmy Fallon: Hey, Meg... (snickers) I'm Jimmy Fallon. It's, uh, it's
  great to finally meet you. I'm hosting. Hey, uh... why don't you come
  hang out in my dressing room?
  Meg: What are you looking at?
  Jimmy Fallon: Oh, uh, nothing. Uh, come on, let's go.
  Lois: Peter, I'm worried about Meg. She's spiraling out of control. I
  mean, what if she develops a coke problem?
  Peter: No Coke. Pepsi. (laughing)
  Lois: (groans)
  Peter: Oh, come on. You set me up for that one.
  Cut to Jimmy Fallons dressing room.
  Meg: Wow, Jimmy, that was everything Ladies Home Journal said it would
  be.
  Jimmy Fallon: Awesome. Great. Thanks. Um, you know, there's there's
  something I... (laughs) There's something I've gotta tell you. Being
  with you just made me feel so a... live from New York, it's Saturday
  Night!
  Meg: (gasps)
  Cut to Peter & Lois watching Saturday Night Live in their
  dressing room.
  Announcer: It's Saturday Night Live.
  Lois: Oh, my God!
  Peter: Yeah, that wasn't a very good opening sketch, was it? A rare
  miss.
  Lois: I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.
  Meg: (sobbing) Mom! Dad! He used me for comedy!
  Peter: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that my daughter was
  deflowered in front of one-and-a-half times the Mad TV audience?
  Lois: Oh, my poor baby.
  Peter: My God, Lois, you were right. Why the hell didn't I see it
  coming? All right, stand aside. It's about time I did my fatherly duty.
  Ha-ha! I said "doodie." But no time to laugh about it now.
  Cut to Saturday Night Live opening stage.
  Jimmy Fallon: Hey, everybody. It's, uh, great to be back. So, we got a
  great show tonight and, uh...
  Peter: Hey, Fallon. Say good night, ya bum!
  Peter starts to beat-up Jimmy Fallon.
  Peter: And this is for laughing and looking at the camera during every
  sketch you've ever been in! Who do you think you are? Carol Burnett?
  You think because she did it, it's okay for you?! You haven't earned
  what she's earned, buddy!
  Peter stop beating up Jimmy Fallon and starts to look around.
  Peter: All right, now where's the guy who slept with my daughter?
  Back to the Griffin household, Meg is back to her usual self in her
  usual attire
  Meg: I'm so glad to be the real me again. It's too much work being
  beautiful.
  Lois: (chuckles) Not for me, but it's good to have you back, Pumpkin.
  Peter: Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do.
  Camera pans out to reveal Saturday Night Live stage with people who
  where in the episode as well as those who did not appear all, all of
  them standing on the Saturday Night Live Stage.
  Peter: Uh, listen, thanks, everybody. I had a great time tonight. Uh, I
  wanna thank Jimmy Fallon for being such a good sport. Uh, Lois, Meg,
  Stewie, Brian, Chris. Uh, the guys from the prison, uh, Counting
  Crows... Uh, uh, if I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry. Good night,
  everybody! Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!
  Credits begin to role in Saturday Night Live style, but quickly cuts to
  the Apollo theatre
  Announcer: From the world-famous Apollo Theatre in Harlem. It's
  Showtime at the Apol...
  Cut to Brian on the couch turning off the TV
  Brian: What? I'm tired. It has nothing to do with the fact that it's a
  black show. What, I can't be tired at 1:00 in the morning?
  Brian starts barking and runs towards the screen, continuing to bark.



Title: The Cleveland Loretta Quagmire

NA



Title: Petarded

[Singing] It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who positively can do
  All the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  Peter, this game night was a great idea.
  Yeah, this will be a lot more fun than last Saturday...
  when we went to see The Vagina Monologues.
  So, in international news, no luck yet finding Osama bin Laden.
  So the government is trying a new tactic. They've hired Jeff Gillooly.
  [Audience member coughing]
  Gillooly.
  [Man clearing throat]
Sorry, I guess that joke was not so fresh, but you know...
  Okay, Joe. Right foot, green.
  All right, let's do it!
  Yes! I am the king!
  Thanks for including my civil rights board game...
  in the game night rotation, guys.
  We're always happy to play Two Decades of Dignity.
  It makes us all feel a little less guilty.
  For whistling at a white woman, go directly to jail.
  Man, does anyone ever win at this game?
  You don't win. You just do a little better each time.
  Okay, everybody, time for paintball.
  I forgot to pick up the paintball guns.
  Well, we could use these. I brought them from the office.
  Peter, is it safe to be firing real guns at each other in the house?
  All right, all right, nobody fire at Lois. She's scared.
  All right, one, two, three, go!
  [Guns firing]
  [AII exclaiming]
  Missed, you ass.
  - Damn it, Peter, that hurt. - Relax, Quagmire.
  You're doing better than Peter Weller from the opening scene
  of RoboCop.
  Well, now that the mess is cleaned up and we're back from the emergency
  room...
  it's time for the last game of the night, Trivial Pursuit.
  Man, I hate Trivial Pursuit. Always makes me feel so stupid.
  More stupid than that time you locked your keys out of the car?
  Damn it!
  Hey! Hey! Somebody! Hey!
  Hey, sir! Sir, you see those keys there? Sir!
  Oh, screw you!
  All right, Brian, this one's for you.
  "What naturally occurring element has the highest melting point of all
  metals?"
  - Cadmium? - Sorry, tungsten.
  Dumb ass. My turn. What do you got?
  Okay, here we go. "What color is a fire truck?"
  Oh, God, I always get these.
  Okay, all right, fire truck.
  Fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, what color are those
  red fire trucks?
  Oh, God, I can picture them now, all red and everything.
  That's right, Peter, they are red.
  Lois, what are you doing?
  [Whispering] I switched Peter's questions to the pre-school edition.
  Just to let him have his moment.
  Good thing I just watched that National Geographic special on fire
  trucks.
  NARRATOR: A solitary killer, the fire truck stalks its prey.
  The fire truck can consume eight times its body weight.
  [Horn blaring]
  NARRATOR: The ambulances will have to wait their turn.
  Okay, Brian, "Name the 16th century ecumenical body...
  "that marked a major turning point for Christianity in Europe."
  I think that was the Council of Trent.
  You could not be more wrong.
  The answer is Phyllis Diller.
  - Peter, you're reading the pink... - My turn.
  Okay, Peter, this is for the win.
  "Say the word 'what."'
  Wow. Okay.
  This really separates the men from the boys.
  Peter, just say "what."
  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, now, Lois. This is not a race.
  Okay, I wanna say "who."
  Oh, boy.
  Fantastic Four.
  Fantastic Four, steak, steak, steak, steak, a small amount of
  peas.
  Is it "what?"
  That's right. You win, Peter. You did it.
  Oh, my God! I won. I won!
  My dad's smarter than your dad.
  - We have the same dad, idiot. - Yeah, but mine's smarter.
  What a feeling.
  This is even better than that time I met Timer the Cheese Guy.
  [Singing] I hanker for a hunk of A slab or slice or chunk of
  I hanker for a hunk of cheese
  When your get-up-and-go has got up and went
  Howdy, pardner.
  Pardon me, sir. I live next door.
  It is 3:30 in the morning. I am very tired.
  Look, a wagon wheel.
  What the hell is your problem?
  I just smoked a whole bunch of crack.
  Good night, losers.
  Well, game night was a success.
  Peter, you do know that all your questions were incredibly easy.
  Yeah, easy for me. Good night, morons.
  You ever stop and think, "Wow, I'm married to that guy"?
  No, I just repress it.
  - Is that healthy? - What's the worst that could happen?
  [Singing] I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor
  I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor
  I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor
  Oh, oh, oh, I'm a tumor
  The administration's plan for peace in the Middle East is
  shallow and pedantic.
  I agree. Shallow and pedantic.
  I agree as well. Shallow and pedantic.
  Everything all right. Peter?
  Well, Lois, since you asked, I find this meatloaf rather shallow and
  pedantic.
  What is this, you're gonna talk down to everyone...
  just because you won a game of Trivial Pursuit?
  Perhaps.
  Okay, you know what? Fine, you are a genius, Peter.
  As a matter of fact, let's make it official.
  You ever heard of the MacArthur genius grant?
  Perhaps.
  Well, if you qualify as a genius...
  the Foundation will give you a $500,000 grant...
  just to sit around and do whatever you want.
  Wow! Imagine what a genius like me could do with all that money.
  All right, Cloris Leachman, I've bought you legally.
  Now juggle these beanbags.
  I don't know how to juggle...
  God help you, Cloris! Juggle the beanbags!
  You may begin your exam now.
  MALE VOICE: A dog says...
  [Dog barking]
  A cow says...
  [Cow mooing]
  Of course, of course.
  Well, here they are, Brian. My test results. Read them and weep.
  Peter, according to this, you're not a genius.
  In fact, you're mentally retarded.
  Oh, yeah? Well, would a mentally retarded guy...
  Oh, yeah? Well, would a mentally retarded guy...
  have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to level half of his house...
  in celebration of his fantastic test results?
  Maybe.
  Uh-oh.
  Congratulations.
  So, as you can see, you are just over the line of mental retardation.
  Don't you mean, just under the line?
  The day I'm corrected by a...
  I'm sorry. Just please trust the analysis.
  Hello. Sally?
  Hey, it's Peter Griffin.
  That's right, senior prom. Yeah. Yeah, it's been a while, yeah.
  So, listen.
  I just found out I'm retarded.
  And I'm just calling to let you know...
  you might want to get yourself tested.
  Hello?
  Peter, mental retardation usually happens before you're born.
  It isn't something you can catch. Don't you think you're overreacting?
  Well, excuse me for being retarded.
  My whole world has been turned upside down.
  Black is east, up is white.
  You know, Peter, I hate to say "I told you so" about not being a
  genius, but...
  yeah! In your... face,!
  I'm sorry about that.
  I can't believe this is happening to me. I can never go back to school
  again.
  Oh, yes, Meg, yes.
  Yes, everything was going swimmingly for you until this.
  Yes, this is the thing that will ruin your reputation.
  Not your years of grotesque appearance or awkward social graces...
  or that Felix Unger-ish way you clear your sinuses.
  No, no, no, it's this.
  Do you hear yourself talk? I might kill you tonight.
  Peter, you're still you.
  No piece of paper from the city is gonna tell me...
  you're any different from the man I married.
  And your life's not gonna change because of it.
  [Clanking]
  What is that?
  Oh, my God, what are they doing?
  Why are they trying to publicly humiliate me like this?
  I mean, what's the purpose... Shiny red ball.
  Peter, watch out!
  So what can I do for you, Peter?
  Well, Joe, I need to talk to you about something kind of personal.
  - Shoot. - Well, you know, I took this test...
  and it sort of turns out that I'm technically mentally retarded.
  And, you know, I just wanted to ask...
  you know, how do you deal with it?
  - Deal with what? - You know, with being retarded.
  Peter, I'm not retarded. I'm handicapped.
  Now you're just splitting hairs.
  [Singing] Hi, Cleveland
  Hi, Joseph
  What's the story, morning glory? What's the word, hummingbird?
  Have you heard? Peter Griffin is slow
  Can he still drive a car? Can he drink at a bar?
  Will they let him have kids? Is his life on the skids?
  Hello, Mrs. Griffin, it's your neighbor, Quagmire
  Now that Peter's mental You probably have some needs
  He's retarded Peter is
  He's retarded Peter is
  He's retarded Peter is slow
  Griffin. Party of two.
  Mr. Griffin, we've been expecting you.
  Peter, relax. It's for liability reasons.
  Now, let's just try to enjoy our meal.
  I kind of get the helmet. But what's with the water wings?
  Well, you did order the soup.
  Like something could happen...
  Get me out!
  These water wings didn't help at all.
  This is the worst day of my life.
  Now, there are plenty of people who have had worse days.
  A parking ticket. I was gone five minutes.
  How could this day get any worse?
  Oh, my God.
  Oh, no!
  I wish I could just close my eyes and make all this go away.
  Peter, look out!
  Holy crap!
  Oh, my God!
  Mr. Tucker, are you all right?
  Do I look like I'm all right? My back is broken and my leg is twisted!
  Oh, my God! Your hooker's dead.
  Well, she was already dead, but that doesn't excuse...
  Wait a minute. You're Peter Griffin, the retarded fellow.
  - Yeah. - Well, then don't worry about it.
  Wait a minute. You mean you're not even gonna call the cops?
  Oh, my God. I could get away with anything.
  "And on the sixth day, God said:
  "'Let the Earth bring forth the living creatures and..."'
  Bible fight!
  [Woman 1 screaming]
  - Sorry. Retarded. - That's okay then.
  [Woman 2 screaming]
  - Don't know any better. - Bless your heart.
  [Woman 3 screaming]
  Jeez, didn't you hear me a second ago? I'm retarded.
  You're just curious.
  Well, let me show you how everything works down there.
  Hey, everyone.
  Say hello to my state-appointed inspirational social worker, Vern.
  It's truly a pleasure to meet you all.
  Hey, Peter, looks like you've got yourself one super family.
  High five! All right!
  So, Vern, what exactly is it that you do?
  I'm here to lend a hand to my main man, Peter.
  - Right, Peter? - Right.
  High five! All right!
  Done.
  - Peter! - What? I don't know any better.
  Peter, I don't like this.
  You are really starting to take advantage of this whole situation.
  Peter's just expressing himself.
  High five for expressing yourself, Peter.
  High five! All right!
  This man seems bent on diluting the already watered-down significance...
  of the elevated hand slap.
  - Hey, Stewie, high five. - Well, it's about time.
  - Psych. - Damn!
  I look even more foolish than when I was at that cocktail party.
  All right, you're gonna love this. So... Hang on a sec.
  Okay, so these two black guys walk into a bar, and the bartender
  looks...
  Hey, what are you guys talking about?
  I was just telling a joke.
  So, the bartender looks around and says:
  "What'll you two fine gentlemen have?"
  And they paid their tab and couldn't have been more courteous.
  All right, my first trip to a fast-food joint as a retarded guy.
  Excuse me, pardon me, coming through. Special needs.
  Yeah, I'll have a... Is this thing on?
  Attention, restaurant customers. Testicles. That is all.
  Give me that.
  Sorry, folks. Oh, my God. Is that what my voice sounds like?
  It's all whiney and nasally.
  You know what? I'm just gonna get my own food.
  - Peter, get back here. - No freaking way.
  The fryolator. I am so taking this.
  [Lois screaming]
  Lois, you look worse than that Rocky Dennis kid from Mask.
  Rocky, I don't even know what you look like.
  - Can I touch your face? - Of course, Diana.
  Oh, God.
  Oh, God. What is this?
  What is all this?
  Am I touching the outside of a house?
  Oh, God! You're a monster.
  I'm beautiful on the inside.
  Yeah, but, Rocky, there's a limit.
  What is this now? Does your face have a pelvis?
  Oh, God, what have I done? I'm the worst husband ever.
  Make that the worst father ever.
  Hi, I'm Agent Jessup from Child Services. I'm here to take your kids
  away.
  What? Why?
  Because you're mentally unfit to take care of them.
  No way!
  - Oh, my God. - Finally.
  I can't believe they took the kids away.
  Well, at least Cleveland offered to take care of them.
  Sorry you have to share a bed, boys. I'm a little short on space.
  Have a good sleep.
  Hey, Chris...
  whatever happened to Geena Davis?
  She used to be in movies, but she's not in movies anymore.
  She's attractive enough...
  but when she smiles, you see too much gum.
  Not a good tooth-to-gum ratio.
  Chris?
  I'll tell you tomorrow.
  Thanks for letting my friends sleep over, Mr. Brown.
  No problem, Meg.
  If y'all get hungry, there's some cottage cheese in the fridge.
  I'm gonna get me a spoonful now before y'all have at it.
  Oh, my God. Craig Hoffman's new car is so cool.
  Oh, my God. Totally. I love the color.
  Really? What color is it?
  It's like blue, kind of blue-green.
  It's the same color as his eyes.
  Wow. I bet he looks so hot driving it.
  I heard he bought it from his dad.
  Yeah, I remember his dad dropped him off at school in it...
  one time when he was a freshman.
  - Doesn't his dad live in Hartford? - I think so.
  My aunt Sheila lives in Hartford.
  They have a mall there that's pretty cool. It's part underground.
  That's awesome.
  Damn it, you guys are boring the crap out of me.
  It's stupid, mindless chatter, is what it is.
  You know what I'm gonna do?
  I'm just gonna go back to my place and rent a dirty movie.
  This is ridiculous.
  That was weird. Oh, well. Hey, let's compare breasts.
  Lois? Hey, how you doing, honey?
  Listen, there's no toilet paper in the bathroom...
  so, I'm just gonna...
  There we go.
  [Toilet flushing]
  Oh, God. Hang on!
  The doctors still don't know how much longer she's gonna have to be
  here.
  I feel horrible, Brian.
  I put Lois in the hospital, and I lost the kids.
  This is turning out worse than Stewie's iPod commercial.
  Peter, you just need to show what a good father you are.
  Then you can get the kids back from Cleveland.
  Wait a second, Brian. You're right.
  And the best way to do that is to show what a terrible father Cleveland
  is.
  This plan is so perfect, it's retarded.
  Good evening. I'm Dan Rather.
  And tonight on CBS News...
  seven Saudi soldiers sodomize...
  several of Saddam 's southern settlement squatters.
  [Whistling]
  I'm Dan Rather.
  All right, come on, ladies. Right this way.
  This'll show them that Cleveland's not fit to be a parent.
  So, tell me, is there any tread left on the tires at all?
  Or at this point, would it be like throwing a hot dog down a hallway?
  Oh, my Lord. Look who's here.
  Agent Jessup, look at all these prostitutes.
  [Singing] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
  Seven. Seven prostitutes.
  This is a shakedown.
  Mr. Griffin, this isn't going to work.
  Yeah. Peter, you and five of those prostitutes, get out.
  So, in conclusion, Peter Griffin, you've inspired me...
  to distrust all mentally challenged parents.
  Thank you, Your Honor.
  And thank you, Agent Jessup, for your comically misleading remarks.
  Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say in your defense...
  as to why this court should return custody of your children to you?
  Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand my surprise witness...
  The Ghost That Never Lies.
  [Exclaiming in surprise]
  But I'm the only one who can see him and hear him...
  so I'll let everyone know what he's saying and doing.
  Objection, Your Honor. This is ridiculous.
  Overruled. I'll allow it.
  You better be going somewhere with this, Mr. Griffin.
  Thank you, Your Honor.
  Ghost That Never Lies...
  did you witness the events that took place on that fateful day?
  You did? Well, how interesting.
  And, do you see the culprit or culprits in this courtroom today?
  You do?
  Well, would you kindly point him or them out for this court?
  Don't point at me, you jackass!
  Well, if there's nothing further, I hereby sentence...
  Wait, wait, wait. Your Honor, there is something further.
  Look, I know I screwed up big time.
  But I only did it so I could get my kids back.
  I love them.
  And I think it's a bum rap that just because I'm retarded...
  that makes me an unfit parent.
  There are plenty of unfit parents out there who aren't retarded...
  but they get to keep their kids.
  Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford. I think the Ramseys still got one left.
  I just want them back, Your Honor, and you're the only one who can help
  me.
  What do you say?
  Are you kidding? You're a monster.
  In fact, if I could...
  I would put you in a place where you would be removed from the general
  public.
  Perhaps locked in a big, secure building with other dangerous people...
  for a pre-determined period of time...
  based on the nature and degree of your offense.
  Unfortunately, as far as I know, no such place exists.
  So I have no choice but to set you free.
  Does that mean I get my kids back?
  Absolutely not. Case closed.
  Oh, crap!
  It was prison you were thinking of. Prison.
  I already banged the hammer.
  MAN: [On TV] And now, back to Jake and the Fatman.
  Hey, look over here on the carpet. That's a cigarette butt.
  This is probably evidence.
  What do you think was in that Danish?
  You think it was cheese?
  'Cause I got a little problem with cheese.
  Hey, I'm talking about evidence here. There's lipstick on it.
  Yeah, well, can you bring it over to me?
  I can't move it. This is a crime scene.
  Well, can you describe it to me?
  You know what? Forget it. I'll take care of this, okay?
  Oh, no. Just...
  Just let me close my eyes for a minute.
  Look, I know his wife is a smoker.
  Just yesterday, when we saw her at the country club...
  she had a cigarette in her hand.
  [Snoring]
  What, so that's it, Peter? You're just giving up?
  I don't know what else to do, Brian.
  I guess we're never gonna be a family again.
  - Hi, Peter. - Oh, my God, Lois.
  - You're all better. - That's right.
  And the doctors say I'll smell like French fries for the next six
  months.
  I'll enjoy that.
  And, Peter, I got a surprise for you.
  You got the kids back.
  I love you so much, delicious French-fry wife.
  Now we can live with you again even though you're a dangerous retard.
  Don't say "retard," Chris. We prefer to be called "little people."
  Because there's nothing wrong with being mentally challenged.
  In fact, I've learned that we are superior people.
  Above all you dumb brainy smarties.
  Someday, you will beg us for mercy and we will consider it.
  Isn't it wonderful that everything's back to normal?
  Yeah.
  Oh, God. Nobody move.
  - What is it? - Nothing. Nothing. I'll get it.



Title: Brian the Bachelor

Cleveland: This is ridiculous. Why did y'all drag me here?
  Because you can't just sit home every night since Loretta left.
  Yeah, you gotta get out and meet some women.
  Cleveland: Well, I suppose I could give it a try. (Walks over to a
  woman standing by the bar.) Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black and
  then have to make a difficult decision regarding whether or not to go
  back?
  Woman: Sorry, I went burnt sienna and never went back. (A burnt sierra
  crayon comes up.)
  Crayon: Ready, baby? Who's this clown?
  Open up, Stewie. The airplane's coming in for a landing.
  I guess the pilot must've been JFK Jr. Ew, even I found that to be in
  bad taste.
  Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
  Lois: Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God. Look at the size of that pimple!
  You're like a circus freak! ( laughs ) I'm kidding. You're just
  becoming a man, sweetie.
  Peter: Yeah, I remember when I became a man.
  Doctor: The operation was a success. What are you going to go by now?
  Peter: Peter.
  You know, Chris, we'll have to do something about that.
  Chris: But I don't want to get rid of my zit. I like him. He's my
  friend. His name is Doug.
  Brian: I just wish I didn't have to look at it.
  Chris: Well, we have to look at your anus all day.
  Stewie: Thank you!
  The Bachelorette comes to Quahog in search of male contestants. Story
  at 11:00. Well, actually, that was pretty much it. Oh, but there'll be
  other stuff, too. Look, I'm turning down the thermostat. See Diane's
  erect nipples at 11:00.
  Meg: Oh, my God! The Bachelorette is coming to Quahog! That's, like, my
  favorite show ever!
  Brian: Meg, how can you watch that crap? That show's not reality. It's
  all staged. It's a complete mockery of human relationships.
  You know, this could be the perfect way for Cleveland to meet Mrs.
  Right. I gotta tell him! Hey, Cleveland. Joe? Oh, sorry, I dialed the
  wrong number. I meant to call Cleveland. No, no, I just wanted to tell
  him about something. No, no, I'd like to talk to you, too, it's just...
  Fine. I'll call you after I talk to Cleveland. I don't feel obligated--
  I want to.
  Chris: You're a good pimple, Doug.
  Doug: Feed me!
  Chris: ( gasps ) You... talk!
  Doug: That's right. And we're gonna raise some hell. All right! Raise
  some hell!
  So, why would you be a good candidate on The Bachelorette?
  I would be perfect for your show because I know how to talk dirty to
  the ladies.
  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That feels so good. Spit in my mouth.
  200 auditions, and nothing.
  Well, we still got one guy waiting.
  You lined up 201 auditions?
  What a weird number. You're weird.
  Cleveland: Peter, I can't do this. I'm too nervous. I gotta go.
  Peter: No, no, Cleveland, I'm not going to let you do this. I'll tie
  you down if I have to.
  Cleveland: Peter, this is only making it worse. Oh, God, my
  claustrophobia is setting in!
  Peter: It's all right, it's all right, it's okay. It's all right. It's
  the fabric. It's the fabric. It's your clothes. All right, let's get
  your clothes off.
  Cleveland: Peter! Peter, what's wrong with you? I'm naked.
  Peter: Oh, God, you're self-conscious. I'm sorry. Here, you know what?
  Look, look. Cleveland. Look. See? See? Now you're not alone. You're not
  alone, Cleveland.
  Cleveland: Let me out of here! I need to get out of here!
  Peter: Cleveland, no. No, you're staying. This, this for your own good.
  This is for your own good.
  Oh, my God!
  Hi, we're here for the interview. Uh, excuse me?
  Brian: Hi. Yeah, listen, I just wanted to apologize for Peter. He was
  just trying to help out his friend. You see, his wife left him and he's
  been kind of lonely, confused about what he really wants.
  What's your name?
  Brian: Brian.
  Congratulations, Brian. You're gonna be on The Bachelorette. Really?
  You sure you don't wanna reconsider my friend?
  Let me see, let me see. Oh-ho, that ain't bad.
  Brian, I can't believe you're gonna be on The Bachelorette.
  Yeah, I thought you said those shows were stupid.
  Brian: They are stupid, but I figure I got a few days of free booze and
  free food before they kick me off. I could use a vacation.
  Stewie: Oh, yes, 'cause you've got such a heavy workload around here.
  Hmm, how you, uh... how you coming on that novel you working on? Hmm?
  Got a big, uh, big stack of papers there? Got a, got a, got a nice
  little story you working on there? Your big -big novel you've been
  working on for three years? ( voice rising in pitch ) Hmm? Got a, got a
  compelling protagonist, eh? Got a, got an obstacle for him to overcome?
  Huh? Got a story brewing there? Working on... Working on that for quite
  some time, huh? Yeah, talking about that three years ago. You've been
  working on that the whole time? Nice little, uh, narrative-- beginning,
  middle and end? Some friends become enemies, some enemies become
  friends? Eh? At the end your main character is richer ( voice still
  higher in pitch ) for the experience, yeah? Yeah? Yeah, you've got,
  uh-- no, no. You deserve some time off. I'm super-excited. You think
  she'll be hot? I bet she'll be hot. I think she'll be hot, too!
  No way-- so do I!
  Quagmire?
  Oh. Hey, Brian. How did you get on the show?
  I had to do a few favors.
  I gotta get on that show! Come on, I'll do anything!
  Anything ?
  Uh, yeah . All right.
  Okay, you ready?
  Yep.
  Okay, check under the bed.
  Nope. Nothing.
  Check in the closet.
  No. No monsters in here.
  Now check the bathroom.
  Nope, none in here either.
  Okay, good.
  So, can I be on The Bachelorette?
  Yeah. Goodnight.
  Lois: Peter, I 'm getting a little worried about Chris. All he does
  lately is sit alone in his room talking to that zit.
  Peter: Oh, relax, Lois. What's a zit going to do? Talk to him and tell
  him to sneak out of the house and cause trouble?
  Doug: Now light it, ring the doorbell, and run like hell!
  Chris: I don't know about this, Doug.
  Doug: Just do it! ( doorbell rings )
  Joe: Oh, good Lord! Is that. .. Doody!
  Bonnie: I'm doing the dishes, Joe. I'll change you in a minute.
  Trevor, this is Brooke, the Bachelorette.
  Trevor: I wasn't too nervous. I mean, when I'm nervous I work out and I
  wasn't working out, so I must not have been nervous. I was... I was
  very pleased and surprised.
  Brian: I really was not expecting an open bar. Top shelf booze, I tell
  you. And this guy knew his stuff. Made me a mojito. I don't think it's
  a gay drink. Mo-ji-to.
  Quagmire: ( breathlessly ) Giggity... giggity... giggity. ..
  Hi, guys ! Well, it 's been great to meet you all and I'm looking
  forward to getting to know you while we're here!
  Quagmire: Giggity... giggity... giggity. .. (sighing)
  Trevor: Dude, put your pants on.
  Quagmire : shut up! Well, I really like all the guys, but some of them
  seem Sa little too competitive. I uh, I gotta tell ya, I don't know
  what she would possibly see in Count Chocula. I-I thin k he's just here
  because he's a minority.
  Chris: You were right, Doug! Mischief is fun! We're the best pals since
  the Snorks.
  Oh, I'm having a really great time.
  Me, too.
  I really value our friendship.
  You're not like those other snorks who only want one thing. Oh, that
  was clumsy. Hang on a second.
  Gentlemen, it's time for the first rose ceremony. Who gets to stay and
  who takes the bus ride home? It's up to Brooke. Trevor. That's what
  Trevor's talking about. Hey, can I say hi to a friend of mine? Uh, sure
  . Hi, Jesus! No way! ( phone ringing ) Hello? I know, I saw! Glenn. (
  goofy squealing ) ( sighing )
  Brooke: Brian.
  Brian: What? Are you serious?
  Brooke: I feel like I didn't get to know you at all. Would you accept
  this rose?
  Brian: ( sighing) All right, but I think this whole thing is about as
  pointless as Peter's cow kite.
  Ah, this is never gonna work. Damn cow .
  Cleveland, what am I doing wrong?
  You gott a get her running before you start running.
  Chris? Chris, honey, can I talk to you? Oh, my God, he's gone.
  Stewie: Ooh, that means this room is mine now. Man, I'm going to party
  my ass off in here.
  Great pot, Stewie.
  Stewie: Yeah, I got it from our cleaning lady's boyfriend. It's okay,
  though, 'cause she's gonna use the money to get a mammogram.
  Lois: Chris! Where have you been?
  Chris: Doug told me I don't need to listen to you.
  Lois: Doug? Your pimple? Oh, that is it! First thing tomorrow we're
  going down to Goldman's pharmacy and get some astringent to get rid of
  that thing.
  Doug: What did I tell you? She's trying to drive us apart. We can't let
  that happen. I am in no mood!
  Welcome to the Saddleback Ranch, and our first group date! Is every one
  ready for a little cowboy action? I love horses.
  Sorry I' m late, Brian. Here's your ride.
  Brian: Oh, come on. You can' t expect me to ride that thing.
  Sorry, we're short on horses. ( sighing ) You know what? Forget it.
  I'll just go smoke. Hey, there, Adam.
  Hello, Henry. I have the power! ( thundering )
  Brian: Brooke? What are you doing here?
  Brooke: Ooh, I just can't take it anymore. All these guys just coming
  on to me. I had to sneak off. Oh, could I bum one of those?
  Brian: You know , I don't even know why I agreed to do this show. This
  is just so not me. I would much rather just be home, listening to my
  old jazz records.
  Brooke: Really? You know , I actually have quite a jazz collection
  myself.
  Brian: Who do you like?
  Brooke: DJ Jazzy Jeff.
  Brian: Oh.
  Brooke: I'm kidding. ( laughing )
  Brian: Oh! You got me. You got me, yeah.
  Brooke: No, I really like Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster... ooh, and
  early Coltrane, before he got clean.
  Brian:Yeah, yeah, no junk, no soul.
  Brooke: No kidding. I mean, look at Chevy Chase.
  Brian: Right, right. You know , I gotta say, I thought she was just
  some actress looking for her 15 minutes of fame, but she's, uh... she's
  pretty sharp, you know? I guess you can't judge a Brooke by her cover.
  ( chuckling ) You can... you can cut that out, right? Oh, and maybe you
  can cut when I said "junk" earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing. Seems
  like he's probably the kind of guy who might sue. I mean, the guy's
  gotta have no money left.
  All right, gentlemen, let's see how Glenn's private date with Brooke is
  going.
  Hey, Brooke, what do you say we get you some more champagne? 
  Sure.
  ( chuckling ) All right.
  Oh, hey, uh, forgot about you guys.
  Well, I guess the date's over. Good night, Brooke. Thanks for a lovely
  evening. (Quagmire sniffing )
  Aaahhh! Oh, my God, Peter! It looks like there's been a break-in!
  Duh... do you think so? ( bell ringing ) Oh, God, they're back! (
  screaming ) Whoa! Awesome! Totally awesome! All righ t, Goldman! What
  the hell's your problem, Mort?
  Oh, I'm sorry, Peter. I though t you were one of those criminals who
  broke in and destroyed my entire stock of acne medication.
  Lois: Oh, my God. Peter, d o you think Chris might have done this?
  Peter: Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild streak you had when you
  were younger. For God' s sake, you used to make plaster molds of
  celebrity body parts.
  Lois: Okay, Daryl, it's almost dry. Very nice, by the way. This one 's
  going on the shelf right next to Dan Fogelberg.
  Oates (?) :Hey, Lois. Am I up next?
  Lois: Just wait in your dressing room. I'll come back for you, Oates. (
  door closes ) I'm not coming back for Oates.
  Brooke: Glenn, will you accept this rose?
  Quagmire: Really? After I drugged you and tried to have sex with your
  unconscious body?
  Brooke: What?
  Quagmire: Yes.
  This is the final rose tonight. Brian. Yes! Yeah, you know, I mean, I
  know I was skeptical at first, but I... I gotta be honest, I've never
  felt this way about anyone before. I mean... I'm in love. That's i t.
  I'm in love. I finally understand those songs on the radio. ? What did
  you think I would do at this moment ? ? When you're standing before me
  with tears in your eyes... ?
  Oh, Brian, I can't 't wait to meet your family.
  ( nervously ): Yeah, me, too. They're, uh, pretty great. Peter: Brian!
  Welcome home, you son of a bitch! So, did you lose? ! You got to tell
  me all about it. Hey, how was the bachelorette? Was she a dumb bimbo,
  like you said, but with a big rack? ( laughs ) Come on in and tell me
  everything. I bet your stories will make me laugh so hard I shoot milk
  out of my nose.
  Brian: Um, Peter, this is Brooke, the bachelorette. She's, uh, having
  dinner with us tonight. I went over this with you a few minutes ago.
  Peter:(laughing and then shooting milk out of his nose)
  Well, it's wonderful to meet you. We've heard so ma ny nice things.
  Yes, indeed. So, how long have you been a prostitute? No, Doug, I will
  not lift up her shirt! Chris, we have co mpany! So... you, uh, yo u
  ever been with a woman? Um, no. Peter! What? ( screams ) There , are
  you happy, Doug? ( sobbing )
  Christopher Cross Griffin, what are you doing?! Joe, what are you doing
  here?
  
  Joe:Peter, Lois, we h ave proof that it was Chris who vandalized
  Goldman's Pharmacy. I knew it. I knew it! I didn't want to believe it,
  but it's true.
  Oh, God, what happened to my baby?! Who sold you the drugs? I can't
  believe t his! ( all shouting at once ) 
  JOE: Do you know what a cavity search is? You made my mom c
  some wonderful times. I really like you ... Look, I understand. It's
  okay. I hope you and Quagmire have all the happiness in the world.
  But I'm choosing you.
  Just promise me y ou'll make him wear thi... What? You're choosing me?
  After what happened with my family? Well, it wasn't as bad as the
  evening I spent with Glenn and his mother. (Mittens meowing )
  Mrs. Quagmire: Glenn, would you feed Mittens?
  Quagmire: Mittens has food in his bowl.
  Mrs. Quagmire: That's old food. (Mittens meowing )
  Quagmire: Mittens, shut up. Mittens, shut up!
  Mrs. Quagmire: Don't you talk to Mittens that way! Mittens is a member
  of this family!
  Quagmire: Mom, you want this three-way to happen, you're going to have
  to change your tone.
  Brian: My God, you've just made me the happiest dog in the world. I
  love you, Brooke.
  Brooke: I love you too, Brian. All right, that's a wrap. Well, it was
  great working with you, Brian. Good luck.
  Brian: What? What are you talking about? Wh-What about us?
  Oh, stop it. It' s just TV.
  Michael Eisner: Hi , Brian.
  Brian: Michael Eisner?
  Michael: On behalf of ABC, I'd like to give you this parting gift.
  Brian: The bill for the mansion?
  Michael: No givesies backsies! ( phone line rings ) Uh, hey, Brooke.
  It's, uh, it's me again-- Brian. Hi. Wasn't sure if you got my last
  message. Or, uh, any of the other ones. Um, anyway, I'll just leave a
  quick message, 'cause you might be trying to call me right now and I
  don't want to tie up the line, so, I guess, um... Uh, I guess, yeah,
  give me a call. Okay, I'm hanging up. In three, two, one. Okay, call me
  back. I'll be here. All day. And tonight. Okay, bye. (phone rings) Uh,
  hey, me again. Thought I might have heard a voice when I was hanging
  up. Nope? Guess not. Okay, I will talk to you soon. Hello? No, sorry.
  Hey, babe, just trying you again, listening to our guy Coltrane... you
  know, okay... Anyway, I got a fax earlier about cheap airfare to
  Cancun. Didn't know if that was you trying to reach me. Uh, you know,
  let me give you my home number again, just in case you lost it...
  Electronic voice: voice mail is full. Damn.
  Delivery Man: (doorbell ringing) Package for Brooke Roberts.
  Brooke: Oh, that's me, thanks.
  Brian: (on new machine) Uh, hey, there. Me again. Your voice mail was
  full, so I got you this answering machine. So, uh, what's go ing on?!
  I'm thinking about doing something tonight...
  Brian: Hey, you're home.
  Brooke: Listen, Brian, I want you to leave me alone or I am calling the
  cops.
  Brian: ? Brooke, I'm so in love with you... ?
  Doug: Aw! Oh! Aw! Aw! Chris, where the hell are we?
  Chris: I told you, Doug, thi s is the bacon factory. Doctor, I need you
  to get rid of this zit!
  Doug: You traitor!
  Doctor: Whoa, that's a doozy. I bet some of those awful kids at school
  call you zit face. "No." Papa Zit? "No." Puss Peak? "No." Fat ass?
  Well, yeah. Tsk, tsk. Oh, that's terrible. Well, we're going to have to
  use some cortisone on that.
  Doug: Oh, yeah? Two can play at that game. (gunshot) Don't think I
  won't do it, man!
  Chris: All right, all right, let's all be cool here... (grunting)
  Doctor: No! Whew! You okay, fat ass?
  Brian: She told me she loved me, on what used to be a hit TV show. God,
  I can't believe I got sucked in to that phony reality world just like
  everyone else. I became the very thing I was mocking.
  Stewie: Oh, I know it hurts now, Brian, but look at the bright side.
  You have some new material for that novel you've been writing. You
  know, the novel you've been working on. You know, the one you've been
  working on for three years? (voice rising in pitch): You know, the
  novel? Got something new to write about now, you know? Maybe your...
  maybe your main character gets into a relationship? (voices rises in
  pitch again) Suffers a little heartbreak? Something like what-what
  you've been... you've just been through? Draw from real-life
  experiences? A little heartbreak, you know, work it into the story?
  Make those characters a little more three dimensional? (very high
  pitch) A little richer experience for the reader? Make those second
  hundred pages really keep the reader guessing what's going to happen?
  Some twists and turns? (squeaking in high falsetto) A little epilogue?
  Everybody learns the hero's journey isn't always a happy one? (normal
  voice) Oh, I look forward to reading it.



Title: 8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter

Episode starts in the Griffin's living room by the front door. Peter
  and Lois are both wearing fancy clothes
  Lois: Thanks for babysitting, Meg. We'll be back in a couple of hours.
  Meg: I don't understand why I have to babysit Stewie. I mean, what's he
  really gonna do if we leave him by himself?
  (cut to Stewie typing away at some sort of machine.)
  Stewie: And now to test my teleportation pods!
  (Stewie jumps down off the stool and runs into the left teleportation
  pod. Once in the pod, the camera zooms out to show that Rupert is lying
  in the pod as well.)
  Stewie: Oh damn!
  (The left teleportation pod lights up. The camera scrolls to the right
  pod, it lights up and smoke fills the pod. Stewie runs out screaming,
  half human, half stuffed bear, having evolved into "Griffin-Rupert".)
  Stewie: I'M A MONSTER!
  Theme Song
  (Cut to the living room again. Meg and Stewie are sitting on the couch,
  bored out of their minds.)
  Stewie: So, um...t-this is, uh, awkward, but, uh, h-have we ever
  actually, you know, met? I mean y-you know I-I don't even know, say,
  for example, if you have a room up there. You know, a room? I have a
  room. You know, Meg, if you kill yourself now, you'll probably get a
  full page in the yearbook. So, um...you know, that's something to think
  about- (Stewie burps) Oh, I just burped.
  (The doorbell rings. Neil Goldman is at the door.)
  Neil: Hi Meg, you busy Saturday night?
  Meg: Neil, you ask me out, like, once a day, and I always give you the
  same answer: No!
  (Meg pushes Neil and slams the door.)
  Meg: God, I don't think I could have been any clearer the last time I
  turned him down.
  (Cut to an episode of "Everybody Loves Raymond")
  Debra: Ray, your mother insulted my steak pizzola again.
  (Meg Griffin walks on into the middle of the set for Everybody Loves
  Raymond.)
  Meg: Neil Goldman of Quahog, Rhode Island -- (Shouting) Leave me alone!
  I hate you! I hate you!
  (Meg walks off the set)
  Debra: Anyway, your mother insulted--
  Ray: (Cutting her off) I don't care anymore, Patty. After nine seasons,
  I just don't care. Maybe you could try not being a bitch.
  (Debra grabs a wine bottle next to her, breaks it on the couch, and
  advances towards Ray. The familiar piano music from the show starts
  playing.)
  (Cut to Goldman's Pharmacy. Peter drives up to the pharmacy, parks the
  car, and walks in.)
  Peter: Hey Mort, Lois and I are out on a date night, uh, why don't you
  give me some condoms? And some Excedrin. My wife's got a headache
  (moves his hands toward his crotch) THIS big. (laughing) You know? It's
  like from the commercial. (moves his hands toward his head) This big?
  Only it's my junk.
  Mort: Alright, then. Twelve dollars and forty-three cents.
  Peter: Aw, jeez, that's more of a ripoff than that breakfast machine I
  bought.
  (Cut to Peter in the kitched with a giant elaborate Mouse-Trap style
  machine. Peter lights a candle, which burns a rope. The rope drops an
  anvil, the anvil hits a switch, and the switch starts a conveyor belt.
  The conveyor belt powers a mini Ferris wheel, which hits some flags,
  makes a propellor spin, and a ball go through a tube. The ball is eaten
  by a toy dinosaur, which flings it on its tail and hits a toy drinking
  bird. The bird presses a button, a balloon fills up with air. Attached
  to the balloon is a string which is tied to the trigger of a gun. The
  balloon starts to float upwards, the string gets tighter, the gun
  trigger is pulled and Peter is shot in the arm.)
  Peter: Gah! Ow! Ow, What was the point of all that? Ow, all it does is
  shoot ya! It doesn't make breakfast at all! Oww!
  (Cut back to Peter at the pharmacy.)
  Peter: Besides, I forgot my wallet.
  Mort: Well, that's ok, I'll just open up a tab.
  Peter: Wait a minute, what the hell is a tab? Does that mean I don't
  gotta pay?
  Mort: Well, not right now but--
  Peter: (cutting Mort off) Aww sweet! Hey, while I'm at it, gimmie all
  these copies of Marie Claire. Y'know in case I wanna rub out that easy
  one before I get Lois into bed tonight.
  Mort: Kathleen Turner's on page 45.
  Peter: (excited) Kathleen Turner, eh, let's see how she looks and-
  (turns to the right page, not excited anymore) Aww, that's a shame.
  (Cut to back in the Griffin's living room. Meg is watching TV on the
  couch.)
  TV Announcer: And now back to the Kids' Choice Awards, with host, Paula
  Poundstone!
  (close up of the TV)
  Paula: (pointing into the audience) I choose you, and you, and you. So,
  come up!
  (The kids are hesitant.)
  Paula: (Shouting) I said let's go!
  (The chosen kids come up on stage. Paula moves back one of the curtains
  and leads them backstage. Cut back to the living room)
  Stewie: (shouting from upstairs) Meg! Meg, I'm hungry! There's a
  granola bar in the cupboard, I want it!
  (Stewie comes downstairs.)
  Stewie: Hey. Hey! What's this? What's goin' on? Am I talking to myself
  up there?
  Meg: Oh my God, Stewie! (Shouting) Just shut up and go to bed!
  Stewie: Do you know what I do, Meg? I spit in your mouth while you
  sleep.
  (Cut to the front door, Lois and Peter walk in)
  Meg: Finally! Look, mom, I've had it! I'm not babysitting anymore! It's
  Saturday night, I could be out having a life!
  Lois: Meg, if you don't want to babysit anymore, that's fine, but don't
  you stand there and lie to me.
  Peter: Oh Meg, she torched your ass, man! She torched your ass!
  Meg: Why can't you just hire a real babysitter?
  Lois: Well, I guess we could do that.
  (cut to Stewie overhearing all this on the stairs)
  Stewie: Damn! I'm terrible at meeting new people...like the time I was
  on Blind Date!
  (cut to the interior of a car. Stewie's driving, and there's a woman in
  the car)
  Woman: I'm having a great time, Stewie.
  Stewie: Me too. So, uh, you ready to go grab some 'za?
  Woman: Uh...yea
  A thought bubble appears by her head that reads "Pizza? What a
  cheapskate!"
  A countdown appears under Stewie that says "Stewie drops the ball in:
  3...2...1"
  Stewie: So, uh, wild guess here, but from the looks of your arm hair,
  I'm guessing you're Italian?
  The woman looks disgusted, under her, Therapist Joe appears with the
  message "Italians are from Italy."
  [cut to the living room. Brian, Chris, and Stewie are sitting on the
  couch, Peter is sitting in an armchair. They each have medicine bottles]
  Peter: Alright, you guys, I got eight crates of Ipecac all on my tab.
  Now, whoever goes the longest without puking gets the last piece of pie
  in the fridge.
  Everyone drinks the Ipecac
  Peter: Ok, here we go...how's everybody doin?
  Brian: Good, good so far.
  Peter: Alright, alright.
  Stewie: Nothing yet.
  Peter: Cool, cool...You know, I dunno if you guys have had any of that
  pie already, but that is, uh, that is some tasty stuff. That's from the
  uh, bake sale that Lois was {suddenly throws up}
  Stewie: OOh, one down. I know somebody who won't be having any {throws
  up}
  Chris: I'm starting to feel funny.
  Brian: Well, I feel fine. I guess I'm {throws up}
  Chris: Oh boy! That means I win! I get to eat {throws up}
  Stewie throws up again
  Stewie: Oh God, why didn't anybody tell me {throws up}
  Peter: Oh my God, my insides are on {throws up}
  Stewie: No, no please, no more, no more {throws up}
  Chris: Dad, I'm scared. {throws up}
  Brian: Get the phone, call 91-{throws up}
  Peter: Lois! Lois get in here {walks backwards, throws up and hits the
  wall}
  Brian: OK, ok. I think it's all gone. I think [throws up}
  Stewie's rocking back and forth on the couch crying
  Stewie: I don't wanna, I don't wanna {throws up}
  Brian: Peter, Peter, I need you to hold my ears {throws up}
  Peter yanks Brian's ears and throws up on them.
  Brian throws up again, all four of them groan, Peter collapses.
  Lois enters the room, holding a pot.
  Lois: Who wants chowder?
  Peter, Chris, Brian, and Stewie throw up at the same time.
  [cut to outside the Griffin residence, Peter is holding a hose and
  filling a bucket with water, Peter looks up at the sound of an airplane]
  Peter: What the hell? Hey Meg, you better check this out.
  Meg opens the front door and gasps. A plane with the banner "MEG, I AM
  YOUR DESTINY. LOVE, NEIL. ALSO, HAVE YOU SEEN MY GOOD PEN? I FEEL LIKE
  I LOANED IT TO YOU IN PHYSICS, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN A" flies by.
  Another plane flies closely behind the first plane with a banner that
  says "WHILE."
  Meg: Oh, God. This is so embarrassing. I can't believe this is
  happening to me.
  Peter pushes a shelf of cards towards Meg.
  Peter: Awww, looks like someone could use a greeting card to cheer 'em
  up. I put these on my tab. Here, take a "Far Side" one. The vulture
  thinks he's a cowboy! {laughs}
  Meg: {Chuckles} It is kinda funny.
  Quagmire walks on screen and Meg walks back indoors.
  Quagmire: Hey, Peter, you got a card for if you transferred VD to
  somebody?
  Peter: Uhh, let's see here...uhh...yep. "Sorry I accidentally gave you
  VD"
  Quagmire: Aw, all you got is accidental, huh? All right, I'll take it.
  [Cut to Lois in the living room interviewing potential babysitters]
  Lois: Well, first let me thank you for answering the ad. Now, what do
  you feel qualifies you to be an effective babysitter for Stewie?
  GUY #1: {Speaking in Portuguese} We're great with children.
  Stewie: Uh, yea, uh, we couldn't run an ad that said 'No Portuguese',
  but, um...no Portuguese.
  [Cut to outside the house, then back inside, where Lois is interviewing
  someone else]
  Lois: So, I see here that you've worked for a family for a number of
  years. Can I call the uh..{squints at the clipboard} Herculoids for a
  reference?
  The camera zooms out to reveal that she's interviewing Gloop from the
  TV show "The Herculoids".
  Gloop makes inaudible noises.
  Lois: I-I'm sorry, I don't understand.
  Gloop makes more noises.
  Lois: The position has been filled.
  Gloop makes angrier noises.
  Lois: The position has been filled, thank you very much, you can go now.
  Gloop makes a few angry noises, and slides off the couch.
  Thundro (also from The Herculoids) walks in and fires rocks at Lois
  through his horn.
  Lois: {Pissed off} LEAVE! NOW!
  The characters slide out with a cartoony sound effect.
  Lois: I didn't think it was going to be this hard to choose a
  babysitter.
  Stewie: Yes, if only you were this discerning when you picked that
  happening hairdo.
  The camera zooms to the front door, a girl walks in.
  Girl: Sorry I'm late. Can I still apply for the job?
  Stewie is dumbfounded by this girl. The camera gets blurry edges and
  the girl slowly brushes her hair and moves her head.
  Stewie: My God, I haven't been this exhilarated since Brian took me to
  see Les Miserables.
  [Cut to Stewie and Brian in a theatre]
  Announcer: Attention, ladies and gentlemen, there will be a slight
  change in the cast tonight.
  Brian: Oh, no.
  Announcer: For this evening's performance, the role of Jean Valjean
  will be played by Kirk Cameron.
  Stewie: OH! Oh, unbelieveable! Oh my God! How lucky are we, huh? 'Hey
  Stewie, what are you doing tonight?' 'Oh, nothing, just watching KIRK
  CAMERON play Jean Valjean!' Oh my God! Curtain up!
  [cut to Mort's Pharmacy]
  Peter: Hey Mort, do these suppositories come in other flavors?
  Mort: Peter, are you EATING those?
  Peter: {sarcastic} No, I'm shoving them up my butt! Of course I'm
  eating them! Gimme a carton!
  Mort: Peter, it's the end of the month, and I'm calling your tab! You
  owe me $34,000!
  Peter: WHAT?! Aww, man, how am I gonna come up with that kinda money?
  Mort: Peter, I'm waiting.
  Peter looks around, and notices the "Employee of the Month" photo of
  Neil.
  Peter: All right, all right, I got another idea. What if I sold you my
  daughter?
  Mort: Huh?
  Peter: You drop the tab, and your son can have Meg.
  [cut to the Goldman house]
  Meg: WHAT?!
  Peter: Yup, all you gotta do is sign this contract.
  Meg: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!? YOU CAN'T SELL ME, YOU FAT SON OF A
  BITCH!
  Peter: Woaa! Careful getting this fish off the hook, Mort, she's got
  some fangs. {laughs}
  Mort: What do you think of that, Neil? Daddy bought you a girlfriend!
  Neil: Excuse me, if anybody's interested, I already have a girlfriend.
  Meg: There's no way--wait what?
  A girl walks out from the door behind Neil
  Girl: You ready to go, honey?
  Neil: You rejected me too many times, Meg. I couldn't wait for you
  forever. Besides, Cecilia thinks my psoriasis is sexy.
  Neil and Cecilia walk out holding each other's arms
  Meg: I can't believe he's over me.
  Mort: I can't believe I'm out 34 grand!
  Peter: I can't believe it's not butter! {laughing} Stick around, more
  Family Guy comin' up!
  [cut to the Griffin living room again. Lois and Peter are arguing]
  Lois: Peter, how could you have tried to sell our daughter?
  Peter: Alright, Lois. I don't want this to ruin our date night, so I'll
  make it up to ya.
  The camera zooms out to show the greeting card shelf in the living
  room. Peter picks up a card and hands it to Lois.
  Lois: Oh, Peter. {reading the card} "I'm sorry I tried to sell our
  daughter".
  Peter: Yeah, you dunno how hard it was to find one of those in English.
  [Cut to the bathroom. Stewie's standing up on top of the sink counter
  getting ready for the night and talking to Rupert]
  Stewie: Ahh, tonight the babysitter comes, Rupert. Lovely LaDonne.
  Mmm...
  Stewie puts the container of baby power in his diaper.
  Stewie: {imitating conversation} Oh, hey LaDonne. Hey, what's goin' on?
  How are you? Yea. Oh, just me, Stewie. Just, uh, bein' myself.
  Uh...yea..Oh, uh, wha, this here? Just my package. Yea, just, just uh,
  just uh, my package. God delivered it, I signed for it, the world keeps
  on spinning. Yea.
  [Cut to later that evening. LaDonne and Stewie are playing Jenga]
  LaDonne removes a piece and the tower collapses.
  LaDonne: Oh no! {laughs}
  Stewie: Oh, Jenga, there it is! {laughs} Oh well, I guess that's why
  they call it Jenga, Mm? {laughs again}
  LaDonne pinches Stewie's cheek
  LaDonne: Stewie! You are so cute I can't even stand it!
  Stewie: Oh, thank you. I'm having a good time too. I hope I don't make
  any social faux pas, like I did at Pamela and Tommy Lee's dinner party.
  [Cut to Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson's dinner party, Stewie walks in]
  Stewie: Hi, Sorry I'm late. I was visiting my aunt in the hospital, she
  has hep...atitis...Oooo, sorry.
  [Cut to the girls locker room at the high school]
  Cecilia: Neil is such an amazing guy. We just make an absolutely
  perfect couple.
  Meg: Y'know, Neil liked me first. And I WAS gonna go out with him when
  I was ready to settle for him. Get your own spaz!
  Meg walks off and the gym teacher shows up
  Gym teacher: All right, ladies, enough chit-chat. Take it off, get in
  the shower, and bounce around for me.
  [Cut to the Griffin residence kitchen]
  Lois: Sweetie, your daddy and I are going to the movies tonight. How
  would you like LaDonne to babysit?
  Stewie: YES! Oh, I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert. I'm gonna be
  cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley.
  [Cut to the bowling alley. Brian is wearing a white shirt and jeans,
  with a cig carton under one sleeve. He also has blonde hair and a
  mustache.]
  Brian: That's what I love about high school girls, I keep gettin'
  older, they stay the same age {chuckles}, yes they do, yes they do.
  [Cut to the woodshop class at the high school. Meg is acting desperate]
  Meg: Please go out with me. I'm just trying to make Neil jealous. I
  promise I'll pay and everything.
  GUY: Yeah, uh, that sounds cool, but I'm gonna be in the hospital that
  night.
  The kid takes the nailgun he's holding and fires nails into his
  stomach. The kid rolls around the woodshop floor in pain and drags
  himself offscreen.
  [Cut to the living room. Stewie's in a robe lighting candles when the
  doorbell rings]
  LaDonne: Hi, gorgeous man.
  Stewie: Oh, you. Must I lock up your tongue with the rest of the
  silver? {laughs}
  LaDonne: Stewie, this is Jeremy.
  Jeremy walks through the front door
  Jeremy: Hey, little man. So you're the guy who's been trying to steal
  my girlfriend.
  Stewie: Wha-you...GIRLFRIEND?! Oh, what kind of sick, twisted game are
  you playing at?
  LaDonne: Stewie sounds a little cranky. I'll put him to bed.
  LaDonne starts to walk away, Stewie grabs Jeremy's hat.
  Stewie: HA! I got your hat! Take that, hatless! Now go back to the quad
  and resume your hackey-sack tourney! I'm not going to lie down for some
  frat boy bastard with his damn Teva sandals and his Skoal Bandits and
  his Abercrombie and Fitch long-sleeve, open stitched, crew-neck henley
  smoking his sticky buds out of a soda can while watching his favorite
  downloaded Simpson episodes every night! Yes, we all love Mr. Plow -
  oh, you've got the song memorized, do you? SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE! That
  is exactly the kind of idiot you see at Taco Bell at one in the morning
  - the guy who just whiffed his way down the bar-skank ladder.
  LaDonne: Goodnight, Stewie.
  Stewie: If he wants to throw hands, I'll throw hands! I tell
  you...{LaDonne puts a pacifier in Stewie's mouth}
  Stewie drifts off to sleep
  [cut to Mort's Pharmacy, Neil and Cecilia are in mid-kiss]
  Meg walks in the door
  Meg: Oh, hey. Neil and Cecilia. I didn't expect to see you here! Meet
  Jake, my boyfriend!
  Jake: I want some BB's! My dad lets me shoot at cats!
  Cecilia: Oh! Hi Meg! Neil and I are celebrating our two-week
  anniversary! Oh, it seems like only yesterday he was only a stranger
  videotaping me through the window.
  Meg: Big deal. He did that to me 3 years ago. AND he gave me the tapes
  for Christmas.
  Cecilia: He gave me DVDs. The production values were amazing, much
  better than Kramer vs. Predator.
  [cut to Ted Kramer and a Predator sitting at a table]
  Kramer: You want him back? You can't just dissapear for three months
  and suddenly decide you want him back! You can't have him! {swipes a
  glass of wine into the wall}
  There's a bit of a pause, and then the Predator shoots Kramer.
  Meg: Well, I'm glad Neil's over me anyway. I'm with Jake now. Right,
  Jake?
  Jake: Maybe someday we'll get married and you can go up on me.
  Meg grabs Neil by his shirt
  Meg: Neil! I want to be your girlfriend!
  Neil: What?
  Meg: I was wrong to drive you away. We belong together.
  Neil: Of course I'm understandibly skeptical of your newfound affection
  for me.
  Meg: You still got that contract our dads drew up?
  Neil pulls out the contract from behind the pharmacy counter.
  Meg: Gimme that!
  Meg signs the contract and kisses Neil.
  Cecilia: {talking to Jake} You wanna hook up?
  Jake: BUY ME SOMETHING!
  [cut to outside by the football bleachers at the high school]
  Meg: I can't believe we're going out. This is so cool!
  Meg kisses Neil again. Neil lifts up her shirt and starts to undo Meg's
  bra. Meg pulls away.
  Meg: Neil, Neil, n-not so fast.
  Neil: {laughs} Uh, Meg, you need to fufill your contractual obligations.
  Meg: What are you talking about?
  Neil laughs menacingly
  [Cut to inside Neil's room. Neil's laying on the floor in his underwear]
  Neil: All right, Meg, according to the contract, every night, you have
  to put on my pajamas. My mom's record is 12 seconds.
  Meg: Neil, I think you're old enough to-
  Neil: {cutting Meg off} GO!
  Neil won't stop laughing and kicking while Meg tries to tell him to
  hold still and put on his pajamas.
  [cut to the stairs in the Griffin house]
  Stewie: Oh, LaDonne, I thought we could watch a DVD together. I picked
  up the first season of Jiminy Glick, oh, imagine being that guy for a
  day.
  [cut to the set of Primetime Glick. Stewie is all dressed up like
  Jiminy Glick.]
  Stewie: {Stewie keeps changing positions on the chair} Colin Farrell!
  So, I was talking to my wife, Dixie, the other day, and she was saying
  that you weren't a very good actor. And I agreed with her. Now, now
  why, now why Colin? Why would we both say that?
  [cut back to Stewie going down the stairs]
  Stewie veiws LaDonne and Jeremy kissing.
  Stewie: All right, that's it! Jeremy must be destroyed!
  [cut to Jeremy's house]
  Jeremy walks into his house, and tries to turn on the lights, but the
  lights won't come on.
  Jeremy: Mom?
  A shadow of Stewie runs by
  Jeremy: Dad? Mom? Is anyone there.
  Jeremy passes a mirror with Stewie sitting in a chair smoking in the
  reflection. He turns around, but no one's in the chair.
  Jeremy: Uh...little man? Y-you in here?
  Jeremy turns back around and a note is on the mirror. "FOR JEREMY" is
  written on the front of the note.
  Jeremy takes the note. It's a poorly-drawn picture of Stewie and
  LaDonne holding hands, while Jeremy's ghost is floating in the sky.
  Stewie runs out from the front door and attacks Jeremy with a lead pipe.
  Stewie: I say, I think this is how you change a tire, but what would I
  know? I'm just a baby!
  Stewie smacks Jeremy upside the head with the pole.
  [Cut to outside, where Stewie is stuffing a bound and gagged Jeremy
  into Brian's car.]
  Stewie: Here's your iPod, so you can listen to The Streaks while you
  gasp for air!
  Jeremy mumbles something
  Stewie: Oh, The Strokes, right.
  [Cut to outside in the Goldman's backyard.]
  Meg is pulling a big plow.
  Mort: Boy, this was a better aquisition than I thought. We may even be
  able to put in some sorghum this year.
  [Cut to the living room, where Stewie and LaDonne are sitting on the
  couch]
  Stewie: So, uh, anyway, um, hey! I made you a mix tape! I don't have a
  dual cassette player, so I had to hold the tape recorder up to the
  radio, so the quality's kinda sucky, but, y'know, all the songs
  describe my feelings.
  LaDonne starts crying
  LaDonne: I'm sorry, Stewie. I'm just upset. Jeremy stopped calling me.
  Stewie: HE WHAT? That blaggard! Oh, come here, let me just, let me just
  hold you for a while.
  Stewie cops a feel and gets slapped by LaDonne.
  LaDonne: Stewie, NO! That is a bad place to touch! No! No no no no no
  no no.
  Stewie: B-But...but I...I...you...I...Waaaaaaaah! [Stewie starts crying]
  LaDonne: No more TV!
  Stewie: Well, how about no more job? Hmm? You hear that miss
  fussybritches? I shall see you fired, damn you! I thought we were going
  to go all the way and die together like Hitler and Eva Braun!
  [Cut to inside a bomb shelter underground Hitler and Eva are sitting on
  the floor]
  Hitler: We do everything together, ja?
  Eva: Ja.
  Hitler: You got your poison?
  Eva: Mmm.
  Hitler: Ok, one...two...three.
  Both of them open their mouths and start to put the pill up to their
  mouths, but stop.
  Hitler: You didn't do it!
  Eva: You didn't do it either!
  Hitler: Ok, ok, all right, this time we really have to do it. Ok,
  ready? Ok.
  BOTH: One, two...
  They both nearly swallow the pill. But when they see the other won't do
  it either, they point and laugh.
  EVA: You want me to kill myself and you're not going to! You suck! You
  suck!
  HITLER: You suck!
  [Cut to the kitchen. Everyone's sitting at the table, Lois is doing
  dishes]
  Brian: Hey Stewie, there's something thunkin' around in the trunk of my
  car and I can't get in there because somebody busted the lock. You
  have, uh, any idea what that's about?
  Stewie: Oh? Oh, that, pfft. It's this whole, it's this whole crazy
  thing.
  Meg comes in the back door. She's got horseshoes on her feet, the
  bottom of her feet are all dirty and her clothes are ripped. She takes
  off the horseshoes and throws one of them.
  Lois: Hey, this is not a barn, young lady.
  Meg: Ugg, I'm just so exhausted! You know, I thought I'd be happy being
  with Neil, but I'm not! This is horrible! {starts crying}
  Lois: Oh, sweetheart, we'll figure out some way to get you out of this.
  Brian, did you find any loopholes in the contract?
  Brian: Nope, it's airtight. The only way out is if Neil commits an
  infidelity.
  Peter: Well, that's it then, we gotta find somebody to seduce Neil.
  Lois: Who, me?
  Peter: Well, if not you Lois, than who? Beverly D'Angelo? Cause I don't
  think she'd do it. And I don't even know how to get a hold of her.
  [cut to the living room, LaDonne is sitting on the couch looking
  depressed]
  Stewie: Oh, hello, LaDonne. Listen, I certainly hope you'll excuse last
  night's indescretion, it was just--oh my God, LaDonne! What's that on
  your neck?
  Stewie blows a dart into LaDonne's neck. LaDonne is knocked out and
  falls off the couch. Stewie pokes the unconcious LaDonne's boob,
  laughs, and runs off.
  Later that night, Lois comes home.
  Stewie: LOIS! Oh thank God you're here, Lois! It was all her friends,
  they, they were doing marijuana and heroin! (pronounces it "haro-een"
  and marijuana, "mara-ju-ana") And they were taking Exema and touching
  each other!
  Lois: LaDonne, wake up this instant! {kicks LaDonne}
  LaDonne: Wha? I dunno...
  Lois: You know what? Don't bother LaDonne! You are fired!
  [cut to outside of the house, and then back inside. LaDonne has her
  purse and is ready to head out the door]
  LaDonne: Well, I really don't know how this happened, but I guess this
  is the last time I get to see you. I'm...I'm gonna miss you, little
  guy. Oh {reaches into purse, pulls out a tape} this is for you.
  Stewie: She...she made me a mix tape?! Oh dear God, what have I done?!
  I've made a terrible mistake!
  Stewie jumps out of Lois' arms and runs outside screaming for LeDonne.
  [Cut to a motel. Peter and Meg are outside one of the motel rooms]
  Peter: All right, you all set honey?
  Lois: {from inside the room} Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this. It's
  so disgusting, but it's for my little girl.
  Meg: Dad, how do you know Neil will show up?
  Peter: Don't worry, Meg. I sent him an invitation he couldn't refuse.
  Peter tapes a big sign that says "X-MEN CONVENTION" on the door and
  they run off into the neighboring hotel room.
  Neil rides in on a Segway in a poorly made Wolverine costume.
  Neil: Hmm....strange...these conventions usually have Segway parking.
  Neil opens the door
  Neil: Hello? Am I too late for the Q and A?
  Lois dressed as Mystique closes the door.
  Lois: Yeah, but you're just in time for the T and A. {growls}
  Neil: Mrs. Griffin! What are you--
  Lois: Shh, you can call me Mystique.
  Lois jumps on top of Neil.
  Neil: Mrs. Griffin! This is wrong!
  Peter and Meg open the door.
  Peter: Well, well, well. Look at this, Meg. Your boyfriend is violating
  both your contract and my wife.
  Neil: Meg! I wasn't doing anything! Mrs. Griffin was just-- OWW, you're
  bending it.
  Meg: I don't care. You've nullified the contract. I'm free! {laughs}
  Neil: Free? I don't understand, Meg. You don't want to be my girlfriend?
  Meg: Well, I thought I did, but I guess I was just jealous.
  Neil: I see. Well, Meg, I want you to be with me because you WANT to be
  with me, not because you have to.
  Neil rips up the contract.
  Meg: Thank you, Neil.
  Neil pulls out a phone and starts dialing.
  Neil: Cecilia? It's The Gold-man. How 'bout we fire up the ol' Segway
  and find a nice, quiet field to do long division in? I-I mean 'a nice,
  quiet field in which to do long division', sorry. {holds hand up to the
  phone} Sorry, everybody. {back to talking on the phone} Ok, I'm on my
  way.
  Meg: He's going back to Cecilia? I can't believe I'm actually jealous.
  Lois: I can't believe I actually touched him.
  Peter: I still can't believe it's not butter! {laughs} Next week, I run
  for mayor of Quahog. Do I have what it takes? We'll find out, don't
  miss it.
  [While the credits are rolling, we cut to the living room to once again
  see Meg and Stewie bored on the couch]
  Meg: Well, here we are again. Another Saturday night with basic cable.
  Stewie: Yep. {sigh} I suppose none of us are really cut out for love,
  and we--OH MY GOD! JEREMY'S STILL IN THE TRUNK! Oh God, how long's it
  been? Uh...let's see...two weeks, yep. Yep, he's dead. Definitely dead.



Title: Breaking Out is Hard To Do

(Lois and the kids are in a grocery store)
  Lois Okay, now don't wander too far, kids, you know more children get
  kidnapped in the grocery store than anywhere else.
  (Cut to a mother comparing products; a kidnapper is sneaking up on her
  kid, trying to get him)
  Mother Hey!
  Kidnapper Aaah! You got me!
  Mother Oh-ho, not quick enough.
  Kidnapper Not quick enough, no.
  Kidnapper I was close though.
  Mother You were close.
  (In the aisle)
  Lois I'm gonna go get some oranges, Stewie. Here, hold the rest of
  these bags for Mommy.
  Stewie Oh, what brilliant parenting, Lois, leave a tiny infant with a
  plastic bag. You know, I might just asphyxiate myself just to teach you
  a lesson.
  (Stewie procedes to try and put the plastic bags over him several times
  but fails)
  Stewie Here I go! Just like that boy from INXS! I'm going to do it! I'm
  going to do it! (He cannot fit the bag over his head) BLAST! Good Lord,
  Lois, either I was a C-section or you're Wonder Woman.
  Lois Chris, would you run and get some milk And make sure to take it
  from the back.
  (A hand in black and white reaches out to Chris and pulls him through
  the freezer. Chris is now in the video for Take On Me, by a-ha. Per the
  video, Chris is soon chased by motorcycle guys. Chris struggles to get
  out but finally escapes and comes out in the egg section)
  Lois Chris, where have you been
  Chris I DON'T KNOW!
  (Cash register)
  Employee $53.99.
  Lois Oh no, I forgot to go to the bank. Well, I'm a little short, I
  guess I'll have to put the ham back.
  (Lois proceedes to put the ham back, then takes a look around to see if
  anyone is looking, and sneaks the ham in her purse)
  Kidnapper You know, I got some candy in my car if your kid wants some.
  Mother Oh, great! Hey, wait a second!
  Kidnapper Aaah, you got me, you got me. I'll get him though, I'll get
  him.
  Mother Oh, I bet you will, I bet you will.
  (Griffin house)
  Brian Hey, is that a ham I thought you put that back.
  Lois Oh, um... no, I put the other ham back...
  Brian I don't remember another ham.
  Lois Well, you were too busy eye-ballin' that Redbook with Glenn Close
  on the cover
  Brian Hey! She is a handsome woman.
  Stewie Well, well, look who's carrying a little crush for Glenn Close.
  What a suprise. Although its not the first time you've surprised me.
  (Cut to Chris's room, Brian is dressed up like Lois)
  Brian Oh, I have so much stuff to do today, I have to do laundry, then
  I have a piano lesson, then I have to make dinner, I am so busy, better
  hurry!
  Stewie LOIS! I want my graham crack-- oh...
  Brian Hey...
  Stewie Hey... um... playin' a little dress-up
  Brian Yeaaah...
  Stewie Yeah, good, it's... fun to pretend. So, um, listen, if you see
  Lois, tell her--
  Brian Graham cracker.
  Stewie Graham cracker, yes, yes, that's it. All right, so, uh, I'm just
  gonna go out in the hallway and throw up about something else.
  (Stewie slowly backs away)
  Lois Oh, this is cute.
  (Lois sees the price is $96.00)
  Lois Oh, my God!
  (She quickly puts it back, then quickly checks to see if anyone is
  watching, she then hides the shirt in her purse)
  (Lois giggles madly as she proceedes to take nearly everything in the
  store)
  (Car)
  (Lois breathes heavily, as she takes a huge puff of a cigarette)
  Lois Ho-oh, my God, that was such a rush!
  (She burns her arm with the lit cigarette)
  Lois Yeah! I'm alive!
  (Griffin house)
  Bonnie Thanks for having us over.
  Joe Yeah, it's a wonderful dinner, and on this beautiful new china! You
  guys have a lot of new stuff.
  Peter Yeah, Lois has been splurgin' her ass off.
  Brian Yeah... she has...
  Peter You know, she bought me something yesterday, but I'm not gonna
  tell you what it is, I want you to guess. Just close your eyes.
  Joe ARGH!
  Peter Its a soccer horn!
  Joe I KNOW WHAT IT IS!
  Bonnie Hey, is that an original Matisse
  Brian Hey, uh, Bonnie, why don't you stop with the questions, you're
  ruining everyone's good time. Like Peter did when he used to entertain
  terminally ill kids.
  Peter Hi there, how y'all doin' All right, so I'm at the DMV the other
  day, LONG lines, long lines at the DMV, but uh, you'll find all about
  that when you get olde-- oh... umm, movin' on! So I finally tried
  Viagra and..
  Sick kid Oooohhhh...
  Peter Oh! We got a joker in the audience. You, uh, got something to say
  there, Mr. Heckler
  Sick kid Dying hurts.
  Peter Tell me about it. So anyway, who hates flying
  (Car Zone)
  (Brian sees Lois stealing a muffler)
  Brian Ahem.
  Lois Oh! Brian! What are you doing here
  Brian I should ask you the same question. Lois, you're in an auto parts
  store stealing mufflers. This is worse then that Winona Ryder thing.
  Lois Whaa, are you saying I'm a klepto
  Brian Uh, actually I was talking about The Age of Innocence.
  (The Age of Innocence)
  Newland It is settled, May. Our parents have consented and you and I
  shall be married on the first warm sunny day of Spring.
  May (stiffly and in an obnoxious voice) That would be most good,
  Newland, most good.
  Newland (sighs) I'm sorry, but she is just awful, is there any way we
  could have like a topless scene or something
  Camera Guy Uh... yeah.
  Newland Really
  Camera Guy Yeah.
  Newland Oh, great, all right, we got a movie.
  Lois Oh, God, you're right, Brian, I'm outta control, but, I dunno what
  to do, I'm just hooked on the rush of shoplifting. I haven't felt a
  thrill like this in a long time.
  Brian Well, I think you've had enough thrills. Why don't you just put
  everything back, huh
  Lois Uh, okay, Brian. You know, you really are a good friend. Here, let
  me rub your belly.
  Brian Ooooooohhhhh.
  (Lois sees Brian is distracted and attempts to steal another muffler)
  Brian Oooooohhhh, put it back, ooooohhhh.
  (On TV)
  Tom Tucker Welcome back to Channel Five News at 10. For those of you
  wondering what I was writing down as we go to a commercial...its a
  cat...just a cat.
  Diane In other news, police are still looking for the culprit who stole
  a valuable Matisse painting from the Quahog Museum of Art.
  Joe A Matisse painting...
  Tom Tucker Also, scientists announced today that if your hand is bigger
  than your face, you have cancer.
  (Diane holds up her hand to her face, Tom Tucker slams her face into
  her head)
  Tom Tucker Ha ha! Got you! Ohh, that's not even really news.
  (Backyard)
  Stewie Making plane noises in a wagon Uh-oh, Rupert, we're out of gas,
  we'd better ask directions at that creepy and possibly haunted house!
  Aahhh! A ghost. Oh, oh, its okay, we got away just in time, we got away
  just in time.
  Brian All right now, is that everything you stole
  Lois Yeah, that's everything.
  Brian You know, you really should talk to a therapist about this, I
  mean it really helped Peter out when he became obsessed with that
  fantasy world of his.
  (Cut scene to Peter reading a book by candle in the attic, then riding
  G'mork from The Neverending Story)
  Peter Yeeeeahhh!
  G'mork You're a little too heavy, buddy.
  Peter Yeeeeahhh!
  G'mork We're goin' down.
  Peter Yeeeeahhh!
  (G'mork slams into the ground)
  Peter Yeaahh...
  (back to the car)
  Brian You know, Lois, we're just lucky we got this under control before
  the police caught on to you.
  Joe Hold it right there, Lois, you're under arrest.
  Brian Oh, crap. Ok, take it easy Joe, Lois will go peacefully.
  Lois Oh, my God, I am so embarrassed. Let me just grab my purse.
  (Lois acts as if she's getting her purse, but then jumps into the car
  and drives away)
  Lois Ha ha, sucker!
  (Joe grabs a gardening hose and lassos it onto the car's bumper. The
  car pulls his wheelchair along with it. The wheelchair soons falls to
  pieces, leaving Joe dragging behind the car. He climbs up the hose and
  crawls under the car to the front window, then pushes Lois out of the
  car. Lois falls to the ground and Joe starts punching her.)
  Joe Sorry, Lois, regulations. I can't give you any special treatment.
  Lois Its okay, Joe, I understand.
  Joe SHUT UP MAGGOT! (continues punching)
  (Courtroom)
  Lois Your honor, I am so sorry for stealin' all that stuff, I just
  couldn't control myself.
  Judge Well, Mrs. Griffin, considering this is your first offense, I've
  decided to go lenient and-- where the hell is my gavel!
  Lois Uh, huh huh... uh...
  Judge Give me that! I sentence you to 2 years in a state prison.
  Peter Oh, that is bogus!
  Judge Order in the court! Anouther outburst like that, Mr. Griffin, and
  I'll extend the sentence!
  (Peter sneezes)
  Judge Ok, three years!
  Peter That was a sneeze!
  Judge Four years!
  Peter I'm sorry!
  Judge Five years!
  Peter You douchebag.
  Judge All right, three years it is.
  Lois Three years in prison... oh, my God, what have I done
  Chris Oh, man, I haven't been this upset since I watched The Blob on
  television.
  (Cut scene to Chris watching The Blob)
  Chris Look out behind you, lady, it's the Blob! I'll save you!
  (Chris dives into the TV and falls to the floor)
  (In prison)
  Guard Here you go, meet your new friends.
  (The cell has three tough-looking women playing cards at a table)
  Lois Umh. Hi, I'm Lois.
  Fisty I'm Fisty, (points to woman) that's Stabby, (points to third
  woman) and that's Balls. Pull up a chair, we're playin' cards.
  Lois Oh, okay. So, are those Biblical names
  Fisty Yeah, Fisty is.
  (Griffin house, completely trashed, everything is a mess)
  Peter Boy, I sure miss Lois. I wish she was here to clean up all this
  stuff. (he looks at his shoulder) Hey, what's this
  Brian Mustard.
  Peter Oh, that's right. We had hot dogs last week. Are you going to eat
  that
  Brian The mustard on your shoulder No.
  Peter Oh, oh, kids, look. A deer.
  (A deer is in the room)
  Chris Can we pet him
  Peter No, no. Just watch.
  (Peter knocks over a can with his foot and the deer is alerted and runs
  away)
  All Awww..
  (Stewie crawls toward the couch with his very full diaper dragging
  behind him)
  Stewie Peter... Peter... there's, there's so much doodie in here... I
  can't take it anymore. I haven't eaten in four days, 'cause I, 'cause I
  just can't fit anymore in there. Help me!
  (In prison)
  Peter Okay, when we get to your mother's cage, say hello, but don't
  drag your ass because I wanna go to the reptile house. Oh, oh, and we
  gotta see those pandas.
  Brian Peter, this isn't a zoo. It's a prison.
  Peter Quagmire, what are you doin' here
  Quagmire Oh, its conjugal visit day! You know I love doin' a woman in
  the can! Oh! Giggedy giggedy giggedy goo!
  (Close-up on a man)
  Guy Who else but Quagmire
  Voice He's Quagmire, Quagmire, you never really know what he's gonna do
  next, he's Quagmire, Quagmire!
  (Quagmire bursts through a background, a la Porky Pig)
  Quagmire Giggedy giggedy giggedy giggedy, let's have sex!
  (Cut scene to a fancy dinner party)
  Host I do hope nothing happens to spoil this fancy dinner party.
  (Quagmire strips down to his underwear, gets up on the table, and
  dances)
  Quagmire Giggedy giggedy giggedy giggedy giggedy giggedy giggedy
  giggedy goo!
  Guy Who else but Quagmire
  Voice He's Quagmire, Quagmire.
  Quagmire Gig-ge-dy, gig-ge-dy, goo!
  (Prison)
  Lois Oh, it is so good to see all of you. How is everything at home
  Peter Oh, it's horrible, Lois. I've had to do all the things that you
  usually do, like the other day I had to go to your book club meeting.
  (Book club meeting)
  Member #1 Well, I really admire the mother character's admission of
  personal torment after her daughter's death.
  Member #2 I disagree, I felt a total lack of ethical integrity in her
  readiness to abandon her children and start a life of her own.
  Peter Uh, here's another thing. The book can also be... (places book on
  head) a hat.
  (Cut back to prison cafeteria)
  Peter And the other night I had to do uh... that thing you usually do
  for me every Thursday night.
  (Cut to Lois' bedroom)
  (Peter grunts as he rams his head into the wall and falls down the
  stairs)
  Brian Ugh, I can't believe you're serving a three year sentence. It
  seems so harsh.
  Lois Well, the only upside is that its given me time to think about why
  I ended up in here. I guess I was stealin' because I was so sick of the
  same old routine, I felt like I had a void in my life, like, like,
  there was a secret hole in me--
  Quagmire Oh, God!
  Lois --and I was tryin to fill that hole with all kinds of expensive
  objects, and things--
  Quagmire Oh, GOD!
  Lois --and I felt wonderful with all those things fillin' that hole.
  Quagmire OH, GOD!
  Lois I did this to myself, so I'm just gonna have to lay back and let
  the penal system teach me a lesson.
  Quagmire That one is also sexual.
  Brian Well, I guess with good behavior, you could be out in two years.
  Lois I made my own bed with this one, guys. I'm just gonna have to pay
  my debt to society.
  Peter Not necessarily, I think I got an idea of how to smuggle you out.
  (Prison exit, Lois is half-stuffed in Peter's mouth)
  Guard Buh-bye, take care now, have a nice day.
  (Peter mumbles something)
  (Alarms go off, the Griffins rush next to a laundry van)
  Chris What do you we do
  Lois Hurry, we'll hide in that van
  (Inside the van, Brian is struggling to stand up)
  Lois Oh, my God, you know what this means. You're all accessories to my
  escape.
  Brian She's right, we're fugitives from the law.
  Peter What the hell is wrong with you
  Brian I'm a dog, all right I have a very tough time standing up in the
  car.
  Peter Well then, we're fugitives, but at least the family's back
  together
  Meg I wonder where we're going--
  (Peter slaps Meg)
  Peter Calm down!! Now I'll tell you what we're gonna do wherever this
  van stops, we'll begin our new life together. We'll blend into that
  fabric of that community.
  (The van stops and the Griffins step out)
  Lois Peter, we're in Asian Town.
  Chris Well, at least I dont have to worry about the Evil Monkey here.
  (An Asian version of the evil monkey in Chris' closet points to Chris)
  Chris Aaaah!
  Lois Well, if we're going to hide out here in Asian Town, we have to
  find a place to live.
  Peter Yes, and we should do nothing to draw attention to ourselves as
  outsiders... (points at a man) Oh, my God, it's Jackie Chan! (points at
  another man) Oh, my God, it's Jackie Chan! (points at Jackie Chan) Oh,
  my God, it's Jackie Chan!
  Jackie Chan Hi there, always nice to meet a fan of my movies. (points
  at Peter) Oh, my God, you're Ethan Hawke!
  Peter Uh, no, I'm not.
  Jackie Chan Sorry, my mistake. (points at Chris) Oh, my God, it's Ethan
  Hawke!
  Meg Mom, can we go get some food
  Jackie Chan (pointing to Meg) Oh, my God, it's Malcolm in Middle!
  Meg I'm not a boy!
  Jackie Chan (annoyed) Yes, you are.
  (Chinese hotel)
  Meg I cant believe we have to live here.
  Chris Oh, this sucks.
  Stewie Oh, tell me about it, I haven't seen one female baby since we
  got here. This place is a sausage fest.
  Peter Come on, kids, we've been through worse. Meg, you remember when
  we found out your gynecologist never finished med school
  (Cut to clinic)
  Gynecologist All righty, Meg, let]s take a look at that bergina.
  Lois But, Peter, how are we gonna support ourselves here
  Peter Well, we'll all have to get jobs, but I'm sure we'll each find
  something we can do.
  Incomplete



Title: Model Misbehavior

[Singing] It seems today that all you see
  Is violence in movies and sex on TV
  But where are those good old-fashioned values
  On which we used to rely?
  Lucky there's a family guy
  Lucky there's a man who Positively can do
  All the things that make us
  Laugh and cry
  He's a family guy
  All right, boys. Let's see what we've got.
  Well, at least we got something.
  God! Damn! Stupid penguins.
  Sorry, guys, but the way things have been going...
  I can't afford to keep you. I'm gonna have to put you down.
  [Sobbing]
  This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
  [In foreign language]
  [Sobbing]
  I love you both. So, sorry. I'll always love you.
  MAN: [On TV] We now return to Gilmore Girls.
  Mom, I need to talk to you about Dean.
  Which Dean? Howard Dean, James Dean or Jimmy Dean.
  Too old, too dead, and too fattening.
  You don't have to tell that to my thighs.
  Can you ask your thighs if they borrowed my Gap capris?
  They did not and are insulted that you've asked such a thing.
  As insulted as Kitty Kelley...
  when people accuse her of taking liberties with her
  best-selling tell-alls.
  - Almost. Wanna make out? - Absolutely not.
  - Oh, you're so lying. - I so am.
  Oh, honey, how was your day? Did you catch any fish?
  No, but I caught this turtle. Named him Terence.
  Then killed him, and hollowed him out into an ashtray for Stewie.
  Peter, we have a family to feed. We all count on you to provide for us.
  I know, and I feel terrible.
  I must look like a bigger loser than when I was on that game show.
  ANNOUNCER: And now, back to America 's favorite game show...
  Bobcat or Bjork.
  Okay, Peter. Listen closely and tell us...
  if this is a song by Icelandic vocalist Bjork...
  or, the rantings of former comedian Bobcat Goldthwait.
  Here we go.
  [Exclaiming]
  Well, Bill, that's gotta be Bobcat.
  [Buzzer sounding]
  Sorry, that was Bjork.
  I tell you, fellows, if I don't find some fish out there soon...
  my family's gonna go hungry.
  If it's fish you wants, Pelican's Reef is where you'll find them.
  I've seen fish there. More fish than you could possibly imagine.
  Fish as far as the eye can see.
  Lots and lots of fish...
  I guess, would be the main bullet point of this presentation.
  Jeez, where is this Pelican's Reef?
  There.
  But beware, no man has ever returned.
  Many have gone. All have been lost. Vanished, never to be seen again.
  No one has ever come back...
  I guess, would be the central theme of what I'm trying to get across
  here.
  Pelican's Reef, huh? Then, that's where I'll go.
  'Cause I'm not afraid of a challenge. Like that time I outfarted
  Michael Moore.
  - Hi, there. - How are you doing?
  [Peter farting]
  [Michael farting]
  [Peter farting musically]
  [Michael farting musically]
  [Farting in unison]
  All right, everybody. I'll be back in a week.
  - Brian, look after the family. - Aye, aye.
  - Chris, don't pick your bum. - No promises.
  Meg, if you get intimate with a guy, make him wear this.
  Dad, that's a garbage bag. Don't you mean a condom?
  Meg, hefty, hefty, hefty. Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.
  Honey, be careful. This Pelican's Reef sounds dangerous.
  That's why I built you a widow's walk, Lois.
  So you can watch the sea until I return. Go on, try it out.
  - Peter, that doesn't look entirely... - Go on!
  Peter, I'm really not comfortable, stepping foot on this...
  Lois, I gotta leave in, like, five minutes.
  Is this scotch tape?
  You drunk.
  Boy, I really appreciate you guys helping me out on this.
  Peter, we're your friends. We're always there for you in your time of
  need.
  Especially when you provide the free beer.
  Hey, I got an idea. Let's play "I never".
  You gotta drink if you did the thing that the person says they never
  did.
  Well, I got one.
  I never slept with a woman with the lights on.
  I'll go next.
  I never had sex with Cleveland's wife.
  All right, let's see.
  I never did a chick in a Logan airport bathroom.
  God, let's see. What else is there?
  I never gave a reach around to a spider monkey...
  while reciting the pledge of allegiance.
  Oh, God.
  I never picked up an illegal alien at Home Depot...
  to take home and choke me, while I touched myself.
  Oh, come on.
  I never did the same thing but with someone from Jo-Ann Fabrics.
  Oh, God, this is ridiculous.
  Oh, boy. He's out cold. Hey, let's write on him.
  [Thudding]
  What the hell is that?
  [Splashing]
  Oh, my God. There's fish everywhere.
  - Wow! This must be Pelican's Reef. - Holy crap! We're rich!
  Rich? I'll tell you what's rich.
  The amusing folksy monologues of young Will Rogers.
  But me, I like the visual slapstick gag. Like this comically oversized
  powder puff.
  Makeup. Now, that's rich.
  Play me off, Johnny.
  [Playing upbeat song]
  In local news, we have more on the approach of Hurricane
  RuPaul...
  which is working his or her way up the coast.
  Let's go live to Ollie Williams with the blackie weather
  report.
  - Ollie. - [Yelling] It's raining sideways.
  Sounds rough, Ollie. You have an umbrella?
  Had one.
  - Where is it? - Inside out, two miles away.
  - Is there anything we can do for you? - Bring me some soup.
  - What kind? - Turkey.
  All right, we'll get on that.
  Coming up next, a pig who refuses to eat Jews.
  After this.
  A hurricane. Oh, my God! Peter's out there.
  Don't worry, Lois. Peter's good at getting out of trouble.
  Just like Kobe Bryant.
  We want the truth, Kobe. Did you rape her?
  [Officers gasping]
  What were we talking about?
  - That's a hell of a catch, Peter. - Guys, this is great.
  Not only will I be able to put food on the table, and pay all my
  bills...
  I'll also be able to finance my Christmas album.
  ANNOUNCER: Sessions presents, a Peter Griffin Christmas.
  Featuring such standards as...
  [Singing incoherently]
  [Singing] Everybody, look at the snow in the yard
  ANNOUNCER: And who could forget...
  [Singing] I brought these gifts for you
  They're up in my bum
  ANNOUNCER: And everyone's favorite...
  [Humming]
  [Singing] Look at the bells, look at the bells
  Holy crap, here come Jesus And he doesn't look too happy
  Merry Christmas, everyone.
  Here's to fish.
  Hey, could I have one of those?
  Hey, Death, what are you doing here?
  Me? I'm here because of that.
  And their vessel was swept to the bottom of the briny deep.
  Swallowed whole by the treacherous, unforgiving sea.
  They sank, I guess, would be the one thing...
  to take away from this part of the seminar.
  When we come back, I'll show you...
  how eye contact can make or break any business relationship.
  It's lucky you packed so many blow-up dolls...
  Quag, Quagmire.
  Be careful. The tiniest prick will pop these things.
  Giggidy.
  We've been out here for days. I'm starving.
  - Hey, what's that? - Where? What?
  You're eating something.
  - You bastard! You have food? - I don't know what you're talking about.
  Give me that.
  Peter! You've been eating my legs?
  Yeah. See, now this is why I didn't say anything.
  - I knew you were gonna get like this. - What the hell is wrong with
  you?
  - Look, Joe... - You've been eating me!
  Okay, you know what. Let's just agree to disagree.
  Hey, guys. There's an island.
  Oh, thank goodness.
  Oh, wow. I feel like an explorer.
  Just like my ancestor, Ponce de Leon Griffin.
  There it is boys, the Fountain of Youth. Just like I told you.
  Well, that was worth the eight-year boat ride.
  We gather today to remember those brave Quahog men...
  who were lost at sea.
  The Bible declares an eye for an eye.
  So, let us now take our vengeance on this murderous ocean.
  You won't be hurting anyone anymore.
  - I just can't believe he's gone. - Don't worry, Lois. We'll get
  through this.
  Daddy, I'm gonna miss you.
  Daddy!
  Oh, he's dead.
  I know, sweetie. I'm sad, too. But you're making a scene.
  All our friends are here.
  Screw you, fish.
  I miss you so much.
  But I promise, one day I'll see you again, Captain Caveman.
  It feels like we've been here forever.
  Okay, here's one.
  What would you guys rather be? Blind or a midget?
  Oh, that's easy. Blind.
  It heightens your other senses to near superhero levels.
  Yeah, and every woman I did would be Cheryl Tiegs.
  Definitely blind.
  You guys are crazy. Hey, you don't wanna be a midget?
  One of those funny little guys running around...
  getting in all kinds of shenanigans.
  Smoking a cigar, while you're riding around in a stroller.
  - Good point. - Never thought of it that way.
  - They are God's little punch lines. - Okay, all right. Here's another
  one.
  Black or crippled?
  All right, fellas. We've been out here for months.
  And we all know that men have certain needs.
  And being there's no women around, we're gonna have to have an orgy.
  - Anybody horny? - No.
  - No. - Yeah, me neither.
  And whoever's toe that is, I appreciate your enthusiasm...
  but I think, you can stop.
  Boy, I'm sure glad nobody's here to see this.
  [Ship's horn blowing]
  TOUR GUIDE: And if you look off the left side of the ship...
  you'll see a bunch of homosexuals.
  [Tour guide speaking in foreign language]
  - That was a great cruise. - Yeah, the buffet was great.
  And I enjoyed shooting Skeet.
  Don't worry, Mr. Ulrich, we'll get you to the hospital.
  You bastard.
  There's nothing good about what you do or who you are.
  Lois, I'm home.
  - Peter. - Daddy.
  - Dad. - What's your name again?
  I wanna say Allen.
  - Oh, it's so good to see you guys. - Peter, we'd given up hope.
  I can't tell you how happy I am that you're alive.
  Oh, come here, sweetheart.
  Wait, Peter. There's something you should know.
  I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but I got remarried.
  What?
  It was a very difficult time and he was there for us.
  What the hell... Who was there for you?
  Honey, I'm home.
  - Peter, you're alive. - Brian.
  This is just like that sitcom where there's two dads.
  Except nobody's laughing. No, wait, it's the same.
  You married Brian?
  Peter, remember. We thought you were dead.
  I needed help and Brian was there.
  He even took a job selling cars to keep the family afloat.
  Well, just get a divorce and everything will be back to normal.
  It's not that easy. What am I supposed to tell Brian?
  Thanks for saving our family, now scram. And besides, he's been great
  with the kids.
  I mean, Chris is doing better in school.
  And Meg even went on a date with the announcer from the Super
  Friends.
  Meanwhile, under Meg Griffin's bra.
  Fine. I can see, I'm not wanted here. Maybe I'll just find my own place.
  Oh, Peter. I just feel terrible about this.
  I don't need your sympathy. I don't need anything.
  You know what? Maybe I'll just go take up my old job...
  as a construction worker in New York.
  Although I never did get the cat calling right.
  [Whistling]
  - Yeah, baby. - I want a piece of that.
  You suck!
  Hey, listen, Lois.
  You know, I know, your head must be turned upside down...
  by this whole Peter thing.
  So, you know, if there's anything you wanna talk about...
  Oh, don't worry, Brian.
  I'll admit this is an emotional time for me but you and I are married...
  and that's the way it's gonna stay.
  So any possibility of...
  tonight being the night we finally push the beds together.
  Good night, Brian.
  Come on.
  Jeez, enough with that already. You're like a dog with a bone.
  Tell me about it. I'll be in the basement.
  - Doing what? - What do you think?
  Wow, Joe, where did you get the new legs?
  Transplant. They belonged to a death row inmate who got the chair.
  Unfortunately for me, he was also a paraplegic.
  Guys, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Lois is the only woman for me.
  Well, then, it sounds like you've gotta find a way to win her back.
  Yeah, like we could get her drunk and take turns having sex with her.
  - How would that help me? - Oh, help you?
  Yeah, yeah. Then, no. No, then, that wouldn't help you.
  Well, Joe is absolutely right.
  I just gotta figure out a way to win Lois back.
  I can do that, I'm a smart guy.
  I once built that time machine out of a DeLorean.
  All right, past. Here I come.
  Wow. Everybody in 1955 was on fire.
  I never knew that.
  - Oh, hello, Lois. - Peter.
  What are you doing here and where are your clothes?
  Oh, did I forget my clothes?
  You know, I'd leave my ass behind...
  if it wasn't so perfectly attached to my sternum.
  Perhaps I should cover myself.
  Look, Peter, I know what you're trying to do...
  but it's not gonna work. I'm married to Brian.
  Oh, that's right. How inappropriate of me. Well, I guess, I should be
  going.
  - Lois, do you have a magnet in your head? - What?
  You must, because it's attracting my buns of steel.
  Peter, knock it off.
  You knock it off. You're the one with the magnet.
  I'm serious, knock it off.
  Peter, no.
  Peter, for God's sake.
  Oh, who am I kidding? I can't fight this anymore.
  [Lois and Peter moaning]
  LOIS: I missed you so much.
  Lois, I smell whipped cream. Are you making strawberry shortcake?
  So it's a shouting match you want, eh? Well, game on, Quahog.
  I'm beating you!
  Hey, Griffin, your sales are in the toilet. You got problems at home?
  No! What would make you say that?
  Ex-husband back in the picture, you're working during the day.
  They got time to bump uglies. That's right, I said, bump uglies.
  Big whoop. Want to fight about it?
  Shut up, Paddy, you're crazy. Lois would never cheat on me.
  I trust her completely.
  [Phone ringing]
  Excuse me.
  I'm looking for a car that's been tricked out to look like an ice-cream
  truck.
  Damn it! I'm sorry, what?
  You know, with colorful pictures of ice cream treats.
  And it plays a tune that's fun for the young children.
  [Singing]
  [Sighing]
  Okay, I'm going out.
  - Where are you going? - To my garden club.
  It's 10:30 at night and you have a saddle.
  Well, it's a...
  What's this? What's this, Brian, huh? What's this, huh?
  - It's a ball. - Oh, is this your ball?
  You want it, huh? You want this, huh?
  Yes, I would like it, please, yes.
  You want this, huh? You want the ball?
  - Yes, I would like to have it very much. - You want the ball?
  I would enjoy having it, yes. Give it to me.
  Go, get it.
  I'm sorry, Lois, I was mistaken. I thought you threw the ball in
  there...
  but I can see now you still have it.
  Go, get the ball.
  I say, are you blind, or just stupid?
  - What do you mean? - Perhaps you'd like to see...
  what Lois and the fat man have been up to in your absence.
  Hello, MTV, I think I would be perfect for The Real World.
  Because I speak my mind and not everyone likes that.
  But I'm not afraid to go there. And I can be sexy.
  Look at my fanny, look at my fanny, look at my fanny.
  - Wow, I can't believe they didn't take you. - Shut up!
  All right, here it is.
  [Lois and Peter laughing]
  LOIS: Oh Peter.
  Hang on.
  PETER: Shazzam!
  LOIS: Good for you.
  My God. How could they do this to me?
  [Alfred Hitchcock theme music]
  Peter, I can't keep sneaking around with you like this.
  - See, it's not fair to Brian. - What about me, Lois. I love you, too.
  And the other thing is, Lois, hi, he's a dog.
  Please. Please don't make this any harder than it has to be.
  You know, I will always love you, but I made a commitment to Brian.
  I can never repay him for what he's done for this family.
  I'm sorry, Peter.
  All right, Simon, do your worst.
  [Musical electronic beeping]
  I find it's easy if I make it into a little song.
  [Singing] Red, green, blue, green, blue, blue Then you put in
  words
  I like tea and cakes for tea and cake time
  - Brian, you're still up. - Lois, listen.
  We need to talk.
  Oh, my, I better leave you two alone.
  - What's the matter, Brian? - I've been thinking about us.
  And I just don't think it's working out.
  STEWIE: Oh, my God. No way.
  You wanna break up. Why?
  I just don't think you're the right woman for me.
  STEWIE: Oh, bitch. You got jacked, bitch.
  Maybe you should see if Peter will still take you back.
  - I'm sorry, Lois. - I understand, Brian.
  There's no possible way I can ever thank you enough for this.
  - You're a good friend. - You're a good friend too, Lois.
  STEWIE: That's kind of nice.
  Well, thank God, everything's back to normal.
  I'll say.
  And to think, Brian, I was, like, a day away from having sex with you.
  I was gonna push those beds together...
  and take you around the freaking world, Brian.
  But a nice pat on the head is just as good, huh?
  - You want your ball? - No, Lois, I don't want the ball right now.
  I'll be in the basement.
  - Doing what? - What do you think?
  Okay, somebody's gonna have to explain that to me.



Title: Fat Guy Strangler

Peter, don't forget you have a physical today at one o'clock.
  For the hundred time, Lois, I won't forget. Nag, nag, nag...
  Sometimes I think I should have married that woman I've met when I were
  at my bachelor party.
  Peter, I can't believe your friends just left you here. Let's get you
  home.
  Wow, strange lady, you're so sexy.
  I should marry you tomorrow instead of that pain-in-the-ass Lois.
  Peter, it's me. - You know what?.. Screw it! I am so gonna cheat on
  Lois right now...
  I don't care if she finds out. - Peter... - You've got a condom?
  Nevermind, I've got this Milky Way wrapper.
  Put this on. - Why?
  Because I'm skipping my physical to go have steaks with the guys and I
  don't want Lois to know about it. - Uhm... OK.
  Lois, I'm going to my physical now. - OK, honey, I'll see you later.
  Uhm... What the hell I've just asked... Why do we need the horsesuit
  for that?..
  That's seven sixteen ounce steaks.
  Come on, Joe, you haven't even finished one! I mean, that guy had two.
  I know, I know, I'm terrible, which is why I'm gonna order the
  cheesecake.
  I can't do it, I'm...
  I'm so full. - Full of what? Estrogen? Come on, take this dirt off, you
  pansy.
  Let's go, shut out, Mary Jane. - I said I can't.
  Eat it. Eat the damn steak. - Come on, what you are waiting for?
  I said I'm not hungry!
  Where is it now, huh?! Where is it now?!
  Easy, sailor. Easy. - Put the gun down, Joe.
  Yeah, nobody is judging you, man, it's cool.
  I'll just put this back in your purse next to your tampons.
  All right, let's start the bidding. Jennifer, how much do you bid?
  $675, Bob. - Steven?
  $780. - Tammy?
  What was the last bid? - $780.
  **** you!
  Hi honey, how was your physical? - Good, good.
  Too good, in the matter of fact, you know what the doctor said? The
  doctor said I was too healthy.
  In too good of shape. Don't even know how. Too good of shape. - You
  didn't go to your physical, did you?
  I did not.
  So, doctor, is Peter healthy? - My goodness, you'll be dead within a
  month.
  What?! Oh, Helga the Horrible, if you keep up that lifestyle of
  pillaging and giant turkey legs you'll be dead within a month.
  Now onto you. - So, what do you think? Pretty healthy, huh?
  Well, mister Griffin, let's take a look at your physical results.
  There's a spyder in here. Now, here we go.
  Mister Griffin, you'll going to expire in a month.
  This is your driver's license, isn't it?
  Now, unfortunately, I'm afraid you're going to die...
  ...when you'll watch these Dean Martin celebrity rosts.
  Will you just tell us how Peter's health is?!
  Mister Griffin, I'm not quite sure how to say this. Kim Basinger?
  But now, onto the cancer.
  You are a Cancer, right, you were born in July?
  Now onto these test results... Oh my, they are much worse than I
  thought.
  My son got a D minus on his history test.
  Now, mister Griffin, that liver has got to come out.
  It's been in the microwave for three minutes, it will get dry. Now...
  Please, we can't take anymore schtick. Please, just tell us, is Peter
  healthy?
  Oh yeah, he's fine, he's just really fat. - Thank God.
  Wait, wait, hang on for a second. Did you just say I was fat?
  Well, yeah, you are pretty fat. - OK, this is news to me.
  Boy, this is more awkward than having sex with the rhinoceros who
  doesn't love you anymore.
  Why wouldn't you look at me, darling?
  Hey, how was your physical? - Stupid doctor said I was fat.
  Can you believe that idiot? - Well, Peter, you are on the large side.
  Oh, please, Brian, if I was fat, could I do this with the hoolahoop?
  Oh, no, no, I guess you couldn't do that if you were fat.
  Careful, Peter, that's an old family photo. My mother gave it to me.
  Huh, that's weird.
  I didn't know you've had a brother. - I don't. I mean, I don't think so.
  Hey, if I'm fat, then Stewie is fat too, because we wear the same size.
  Hello pumpkin. - Hello daddy.
  Did I miss your piano recital? - No, daddy. I'm in my forties now.
  Good God! - I have a question I'd wanted to ask.
  Do I have a brother? - No, no, don't be silly!
  'Cause I found this picture...
  Oh, Dick, thanks God you're here. Talk to her. - Message CM 27.
  The subscriber you are trying to reach is unavailable or outside the
  calling area.
  What do you feel like doing later? - Message CM 42.
  Let's go pay some hookers to knuck our junk around.
  Are you sure this is a good idea?
  Dad is never gonna tell me the truth. The only way to find out is to
  check the family records.
  Huh, breaking into the grandpa' and grandma's house. This is more
  exciting than that time I saw Bobby MacFerrin fall down all those
  stairs.
  Wait! What are you doing? They are sleeping in here. - Oh please, they
  get so doped upon sleeping pills and liquor
  an earthquake wouldn't wake them up.
  My God, how does she sleep at night knowing she has to funnel this old
  duffer's hog?
  This is it, Patrick Pewterschmidt. Meadowlane 56, Brookfield.
  I do have a brother. Oh my God, I've got to meet him.
  Hey Brian, you know what would be fun?
  Oh, God, totally.
  Awesome!
  You know, sometimes the old-fashioned play things are the best.
  Hey, kids of America! It's hand-painted wooden ball-in-a-cup!
  Who needs constant electronic video stimulation, when there's
  ball-in-a-cup.
  Mexico's favourite toy for over 340 years!
  Toss the ball, catch it in the cup, thumb it out of the cup, toss it
  and catch it in the cup again.
  The ball is on the string and attached to the cup, so there's no worry
  if you don't catch the ball-in-a-cup
  and clean-up is as easy as catching a ball-in-a-cup.
  So why spend another day not catching a ball-in-a-cup
  when you could be catching a ball-in-a-cup.
  Peter, I think maybe you're in denial about this fat thing.
  Oh yeah? Well I challenge you to prove to me that I'm fat. - OK, hang
  on.
  See this? - Yeah. - You know what it is? - It's an apple. - Good, good,
  good.
  All right, watch this.
  What da hell? What is this?
  What is this, some kind of gag? - No, that's orbit.
  You have your own gravitational pole. - Oh that's a bunch of crap.
  Now back to The Three Stooges.
  Can you believe I'm about to meet my long-lost brother? Maybe DateLine
  will do a story about us, huh?!
  I've got to meet that pumpers ass Stone Phillips.
  He's a kinda guy you hate till he's inside ya.
  That is, Meadowlane 56.
  Brookfield insane asylum? - My God, mom's brother's crazy.
  Oh no, I didn't catch the ball-in-a-cup.
  Oh, wait a minute, it's OK, because the ball is on the string and
  attached to the cup.
  Doctor, is my brother really insane?
  Mrs. Griffin, we do not use the word 'insane'.
  We prefer the term 'mentally hilarious'.
  I can't wait to meet the lunatic.
  I bet it's even weirder than commercial I saw.
  Hey, is that the new butter substitute? - It sure is. Is it true it has
  half the calories of butter and margarine with all the great taste?
  Can I have that? - Get your own.
  Take that, you bitch! - What da hell?!
  How do you like that?
  Joke's on you, I have hepatitis.
  Patrick? My name is Lois, i'm your sister.
  Oh my God, Lois, I never thought i'd see you again.
  These are my children. - Why are you living in a crazy house, uncle
  Patrick?
  Well, when I was just a little boy, I had a very traumatic experience.
  Mommy, can I have a drink of water?
  Jackie Gleason! - Beat it, kid, your mother's busy.
  Pow! Right in the kisser!
  Oh, that's a horrible story. - Yes, I was so traumatized they sent me
  here
  and I guess they must have forgotten about me.
  Well, you seem perfectly normal to me. And no brother of mine is gonna
  be couped up inside insane asylum.
  We are taking you back to Quahog with us. - Oh, that's a great idea.
  Maybe he can bring us a sling blade and order up some french-fried
  potaters.
  Thank God I'm out of that hospital. It's great to be eating lunch with
  my family,
  instead of a bunch of chronic masturbaters. Those people are disgusting.
  Is it lonely up there on your pedestal, Patrick? - Oh, Peter, there you
  are. This is my brother, Patrick.
  Ye-yeah, good to meet you, Patrick.
  All right, listen up everybody. I have something to tell you.
  I'm not quite sure how to say this.
  I'm fat.
  I'm gonna give you a minute to absorb that.
  That's the way it is, it's nobody's fault. Meg.
  But I decided to do something about it. - Oh great, you can drop some
  weight, fat ass?
  No, dummie. I'm gonna help make this a fatman's world.
  By establishing the National Association for the Advancement of Fat
  People.
  This is the best idea I've had since I slayed that dragon.
  Cybil Shepard? - Yes?
  People, you are free!
  You know, I'm very glad you're here, Patrick.
  Well, I wanna tell you that Marion and I both appreciate what you've
  done.
  Marion? Oh, you have a girlfriend?
  Oh, where are my manners? Marion is my wife. She's sitting right next
  to me.
  Here we go.
  Nice to meet you, Marion. - What's that, honey?
  Oh, yes. Hang on, Marion wants some coffee.
  Lois, did you see that? He is nuts! - Brian, he's been locked up in
  that place for 30 years.
  It's perfectly understandable that he did invent an imaginary
  companion. - Yes, he is even more imaginative than the people who
  invented singing.
  All right everyone, I'd like to get started.
  You know, maybe everyone should sit down.
  OK, that's better. Welcome everybody to the...
  Snacks are best saved for later.
  OK, now I've prepared an agenda for our organisation, what we want from
  the community as fat people with pride.
  All right, I think we've got a lot accomplished here today, we'll pick
  this up again tomorrow.
  Hey guys, I'm going for a run, do me a favour in keep Marion company
  while I'm gone?
  Aaa, sure. - Great. Buy, honey.
  Hey Brian, Marion just called you an alcoholic.
  Oh yeah?.. Marion just called you a homo! - Wait a second, I'll be
  right back.
  Hey Brian, what if I put this cucumber right here, put the cucumber
  right there.
  Do you think Patrick will be angry? - I don't know man, it's his wife.
  If I put it right there?
  Right at that spot, right there on the couch?
  Hey, Marion is giving you the thumbs up. - What we should do?
  We should lay it and sit here for a couple of weeks and see if it
  pickles.
  If out of three weeks it pickles, then she's real, and we both have to
  buy Patrick a steak.
  Hey, pie. I know what you want. I saw you in that movie.
  Whore, slut, bitch.
  You don't deserve damn sex with me, instead I'm gonna it the hole out
  of ya.
  Peter, did you start a coalition for fat guys? - Yrah, the Fat Guy
  Coalition.
  Peter, you shouldn't encourage people to be fat. Fat people are immoral.
  How did you figure, sports fan? - They are just bad people, like that
  Jackie Gleason.
  He was fat, and he was bad. One time, when I was a boy...
  Oh, I love Jackie Gleason, hey, take a look on what I bought at this TV
  convention.
  It's a bus driver's uniform. Pow! Right in the kisser!
  Wow, that's set him off like a Paul Schaefer firealarm.
  Hello? - Lois, it's your father. The hospital called and said you
  released Patrick.
  Have you lost your mind? He's incredibly dangerous.
  Oh, well that's ridiculous! Patrick is a very nice man, and you should
  be ashamed of yourself for locking up your own son!
  Whose pickle is this?
  This just in: the body of a local fatman was found murdered in Quahog
  park last night.
  Police released this sketch of the suspect:
  Oh my God!
  Police also released this sketch of a female accomplice believed to be
  his wife:
  Hello, I'm Tom Tucker. Quahog's newest serial killer has struck again.
  Since the first victim at Quahog park last week, three more men have
  been killed. All of them very, very fat.
  Lois, that sketch looks a lot like Patrick. - Oh, that's ridiculous.
  I don't know, I mean he's clearly crazy, look at that imaginary wife of
  his.
  Well if she's imaginary, how will you explain a pickle on the couch?
  I don't understand what...
  Oh wait? Really? Hey Stewie!
  I know, I know, I've heard.
  Patrick, where have you been?
  Oh, it's nothing you need to concern yourself with, Lois.
  That's a relief.
  Oh yeah, yeah, that's a relief, the fat guy strangler is living here,
  and there's a fat guy in the house.
  This will be a bigger disaster the one Peter did Tara Reids' boob-job.
  Oop, drop some pepperoni on there.
  You know what'll work, soda.
  All right everybody, just make yourselves at home. Lois, these are the
  fat guys. Fat guys - Lois.
  My God, look at you, fat bastards. I'd bet on you you can't even find
  your own penis.
  Find your penis for a dollar? Find your penis for one dollar!
  Peter, what's going on? - Lois, my people are in danger.
  Until they find the Fat Guy Strangler we will stay... Victor, don't
  lean against that!
  Hi, everybody!
  Peter, you've got to get these guys out of here. Patrick is the
  murderer. - What?
  You son of a bitch. - Don't listen to Brian.
  He doesn't know what he's talking about. - Out of my way, Lois, your
  brother is toast!
  Warm, buttery toast.
  That's sounds good. - I love toasts.
  I've just found my penis.
  Run, Patrick, run! - After him!
  Boys, to your rascals!
  He went into James Woods, let's spread out and find him.
  We'll head him...
  Todd, man, you've got to chew your food.
  Brian, I know my brother, he couldn't have done these things. - Well,
  let's see if you feel that way when you see this:
  Look.
  So he has pictures of himself strangling fat guys, but that doesn't
  mean he's the fat guy strangler.
  Oh yeah, what about the dead fat guy under his bed? - Coincidence?
  What about the half-dead fat guy in the corner?
  Patrick tried to kill me. - Well maybe it's a different Patrick.
  Lois! - OK, OK.
  Oh my God, Peter is out there with him. - Wait!
  You gonna eat that fat guy?
  How we gonna find them? - Don't worry, Lois. I'm good at finding people.
  I was the one to found Bush after hurricane Katrina.
  Uhm, mister president, are you up there? - Go away!
  Sir, there's a disaster in New Orleans. - I'm reading Superfudge.
  You've got to come down and deal with this. - Don't make me do stuff.
  Patrick! Patrick! Oh crap, I guess we've lost him. Well, nothing left
  to do but finish the sentence on interrupt...
  Patrick, let him go. - Don't come any closer!
  Patrick, let him go.
  Or Marion gets it. - Nice try, but Marion is over there.
  Don't hurt her!
  Now let him go! - OK, OK.
  You missed! - No, I didn't.
  That's for rolling up the damn window when I tried to jump into the
  general Lee.
  I'm sorry, Lois. I've never meant to hurt anybody.
  I mean I did mean to kill those fat guys, but I've never meant to hurt
  you.
  You may be very sick, Patrick, but I love you.
  You're my brother, and you'll always be my brother.
  I have to go back to the hospital, don't I. - Yeeah, I'm afraid so.
  Hey Patrick, did you see that rock hit me in the face? It was like
  Pow! Right in the kisser.
  Stop screaming, you can't hear me.
  I miss uncle Patrick. - Don't worry kids, I promise we can visit him
  once a month.
  We'll be his period.
  I was just upstairs and there's a half-dead fat guy eating up dead fat
  guy?
  So I guess we just we're just lookin' the other way, huh...



Title: Stewie Griffin the Untold Story

Live from Quahog, Rhode Island, this is Channel Five Action News...
  ...with Tom Tucker, Diane Simmons...
  ...and Blaccu-weather meteorologist, Ollie Williams.
  - Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. - And I'm Diane Simmons.
  Could we talk about something besides yourself, Diane?
  - Excuse me? - Great. Tonight, in the news, two local men arrested...
  ...as part of an illegal steroid ring.
  These charges are false. Our muscles are the result...
  ...of hundreds of squat-thrusts and somersaults down on the hard ground.
  Stop pushing! Save your roughneck tactics for Sacco and Vanzetti.
  Hup! Hup-ho! Hup!
  Meanwhile, authorities acting on a tip...
  ...searched the marshlands near the Fox Point hurricane barrier...
  ...for what they believed to be the remains...
  ...of reputed mobster "Big Fat" Pauly.
The authorities were disappointed to find not the remains of"Big Fat"
  Pauly...
  ...but, instead, The Remains of the Day, a boring Merchant-Ivory film...
  - Starring Sir Anthony Hopkins. - Hmm. Funny how they could've confused
  that.
  Coming up, why your next trip to the salad bar could be your last.
  But first, we go live to the Quahog Performing Arts Center...
  ...where Asian correspondent, Tricia Takanawa is down at the red carpet.
  Tom, tonight the stars are out...
  ...for a special sneak preview of a straight-to-DVD feature...
  ...that will soon be in the $3.99 bin at your local car wash.
  Here comes Mayor Adam West, himself.
  Mr. West, do you have any words for our viewers?
  Box, toaster, aluminum, maple syrup- No, I take that one back.
  - I'm gonna hold on to that one. - Thank you, Mayor West.
  Oh, and if I'm not mistaken, it's local folk legend and ward of the
  state...
  Quahog's own Greased-up Deaf Guy.
  Don't judge me! I'm just doin' my thing! See you in the theater.
  - Evil, over here! - Hey, Evil Monkey!
  And here come two popular Family Guy guest stars...
  Drew Barrymore and her date.
  Hey, Kool-Aid!
  - Oh, yeah! - Things going well with Drew?
  Oh, yeah!
  We have so much fun and he keeps my tongue really red.
  See?
  Hey, thank y'all for coming out. Don't forget to check out my clothing
  line, C.C. Brown...
  ...available at many retail outlets.
  Got y'all in here.
  And here are the stars of tonight's film, the Griffin Family.
  Whoa! What's this, a party?
  How'd you all get in my room?
  Hi, I'm Brian.
  Um, I rode backwards in the limo, so...
  ...uh, actually, my underpants were going the right way.
  - Stewie! Stewie! Good to have you back! - Good to be back.
  Especially since my brief foray into politics didn't work out.
  Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him!
  Stewie, I'm from TVGuide. How does it feel...
  ...to be the youngest working actor in Hollywood?
  Well, it feels about like seven figures a year, which feels pretty good.
  Stewie! Stewie! Hi, I'm from the L.A. Times.
  Can you tell us, are you working on any new projects?
  Well, yes. I just did an episode of According toJim.
  I'm the comic relief.
  Stewie, do you know if Fox has any plans to bring back Futurama?
  - What magazine are you from? - Entertainment Weekly.
  — La, la, la, la Family Guy —
  H- H-Hey, everybody!
  - I am sorry. I am so sorry. There was booze in the car.
  I'm sorry.
  Oh, God, Lois! For Christ's sake, take it easy, will ya?
  - When I heard-When I heard... - God.
  That we was gonna be in a movie, I was like, "Fuck, yeah!"
  All right. You know what? Let's just try and walk straight here.
  Just-
  Lois, get up. Oh, God. Lois, get up.
  - Get on! - I'm not gonna get on.
  I am not gon- Lois. Lois. You get up.
  - Peter. - What?
  - Get on. - Son of a bitch.
  I- I am really sorry, everybody.
  Oh, G- Oh! All right. You know what?
  - Let's get inside. Come on. - Ow!
  So, Meg, how does it feel to be the center of attention?
  Oh, my God. You talkin' to me?
  Are you talkin' to me? Okay. Okay.
  - Well, I thought a lot about it, and I- - And here comes David Bowie.
  - David, what brings you all the way to- - Shh!
  Just you shut your mouth.
  Oh, me love to meet Ziggy Stardust!
  I take you home. I make you fish bowel soup. Fish bowel!
  Thank you, Tricia, for setting your people back a thousand years.
  And now we'll cut inside the theater to our hidden cameraman...
  ...who'll be providing us with a bootleg copy of the movie.
  Vince Vaughn, Susan Sarandon...
  ...in Two People Who Look Like They Never Sleep.
  Hey, Mary, how'd you sleep last night?
  Ugh, I had plenty of sleep. Stop asking me that.
  - Well, you look tired. - Well, so do you.
  - Fine. - Yeah.
  I'm a little bunny and I'm separated from my family.
  Oh, no. I have a long journey to go on.
  I wish I didn't have to go it alone.
  Hey, Mr. Bear, I need your help.
  But I'm a loner bear who don't like to be bothered by other folks.
  A story of friendship, with music by Randy Newman.
  — It's a story 'bout friendship with music by me —
  — 'Bout a bear and a bunny —
  — In the end the bunny's family dies but the bear becomes his
  new family —
  — Something like that —
  Whee!
  Mom, look! Mom! Mom!
  Mom! Mom! Mom, look at me!
  Look at me! Mom! Mom!
  Mom!
  - How was that? - Your third somersault was a little sloppy.
  But what do I know, huh?
  It's been so long since I qualified for the Olympics.
  - You were in the Olympics? - No, I got pregnant with Meg and couldn't
  go.
  Now I'm pro-choice.
  Hey! Hey, Meg. Go crouch down behind Brian.
  - I'm gonna push him in the pool. - Okay.
  - Dad! - Ow! Damn it!
  Meg, you did it wrong!
  See ya later, honey. I guess I can't go swimmin' for half an hour.
  Giggedy-giggedy-giggedy-goo!
  Hey, Stewie. How 'bout Daddy teaches ya how to swim?
  Go... Away... Fat man.
  What do you think you're doing? "No" means "no"!
  Okay. Here goes.
  Come on, Stewie. In... The... Pool.
  No! No, I don't want to die! I want to live! Live!
  Peter, stop it. He's never gonna learn like that.
  Maybe this summer he should take swim lessons.
  - Would ya like that, Stewie? - Hmm.
  Well, I guess it couldn't be worse than that summer I spent in India.
  Whatever you do, short-round, don't touch anything.
  Okay, Dr. Jones, I no touch anything.
  - Indy! - Lady only here 'cause she humping director.
  Whoa. Look at this place. What happened to Sal's Video?
  We bought them out two weeks ago. Welcome to Lackluster Video.
  50,000 stores nationwide.
  Yeah, well, uh, you know, I used to come into Sal's once or twice a
  week...
  ...to rent movies from his, uh... Back room.
  You know what I mean? Room for, uh, adults only.
  Catch my drift? The, uh, kind of movies where there are X-rated
  pornos...
  ...and fully-nude people fornicate for the camera and stuff comes out.
  - Get my meaning? - Oh, I'm sorry, but Lackluster Video...
  ...takes a strong moral stance against pornography...
  ...open-mindedness and non-Christians.
  Oh, yeah? Then why do you rent Prince of Tides? Barbra Streisand is
  Jewish.
  We edit some of our movies.
  I think I'm in love with you, Doctor.
  No, Tom, you're wrong. You don't love me. You love the idea of me.
  Hi, I'm Tom Tucker. Do me a favor and fill this bag...
  ...with motion pictures featuring women-on-women or anything with an
  amputee.
  Save your money, Tucker. This place doesn't have porn. They think it's
  immoral.
  You know, that really grinds my gears.
  Where in the Bible does it say a man can't fire off some
  knuckle-children...
  ...in the privacy of his own neighbor's living room, while his neighbor
  is at work...
  ...because I don't have a DVD player?
  I don't know where it says it because the Bible is way too long to read.
  Hey, that was quite a rant there.
  You know, we're looking for an everyman to rant about petty,
  nonsensical irritants...
  ...to replace our "Spotlight on the Middle East" segment.
  Hey! I'd be great at that!
  I've been dying to get back on television ever since I stopped hosting
  Family Feud.
  How are you, Betsy? Welcome to the show. You are a lovely young woman.
  Stick my hand up there and feel that one.
  And that one.
  We're looking for somethin' you shop for at the mall. Three seconds.
  Come on, Stewie. Don't be afraid.
  It's just water. It's not gonna bite.
  Shut up! I know it's not going to bite, stupid.
  What a stupid thing to say. You drown in it, you moron. It doesn't have
  to bite you.
  Hey, little guy. Take a look at Brad over there. He's my star pupil.
  - See how brave he is? - He's not brave.
  I'll tell you who was brave- Gandhi.
  And the black people are always like, "Hey, bitch. "
  And the Indian people, we do not call our women in such a way.
  Boo.! You suck.!
  Okay, parents. Next week's the toddler's swim meet.
  It's gonna be a lot of fun!
  You know, that is a remarkable resemblance, Brad.
  You, on your back, in the water- You look like one of my stools!
  So, is it just pool water that turns you into a sniveling girl, or is
  it all water?
  Mom! Brian's asking me if it's just pool water that turns me...
  ...into a sniveling girl or if it's all water!
  I heard that Olympic swimmers shave all the hair off their head and
  their private areas...
  ...to make 'em move faster.
  I don't need some stupid gimmick.
  Soon as I improve my technique, I'll outswim Brad as easily as I took
  care of that other boy.
  Casper, go long!
  Ooh, sorry about that, man.
  - Are you dead? - Yeah, whatever.
  I was gonna off myself on Tuesday anyway.
  Hey, Peter, shouldn't you be getting ready for your first news segment?
  Yeah. I'm a little nervous, though. I'm not sure what to talk about.
  - You could talk about me. - Okay, honey. I'll talk about you.
  "Hey, I'm Meg. I go to school. I wear glasses. "
  Spot on. Spot on.
  Oh, Peter, you'll be great. You're a natural.
  I always said they never should have replaced you on Roseanne.
  Hey, Rosie, have you seen Darlene?
  ...and junk.
  Uh, I-I don't, uh- I can't, uh-What?
  In other news, after several grueling days of frightening uncertainty...
  - I finally get my period. - Well, Diane, I'm sure you and your
  brother...
  ...must be devastated by the loss of the two-headed offspring that
  might have been.
  We now go to Peter Griffin for "You Know What Really Grinds My Gears?"
  Thanks, Tom. You know what really grinds my gears?
  Nobody's come up with a new priest-and-rabbi joke in, like, 30 years.
  You know? I mean, okay. Um, um-
  A priest and rabbi go into the supermarket and, uh, the priest...
  ...wants to buy a ham and the rabbi says...
  "Uh, I can't eat it. It's forbidden.
  Couldn't eat it. Not allowed. "
  Pigs are like superheroes to them. Is it perfect? No.
  L- I don't see you comin' up with anything.
  And that, people, is what grinds my gears. Tom.
  Come on. You gonna be all day?
  - I'm brushing my teeth. - You only have, like, two.
  - I mean, how long could- Oh, God! - Oh. Hey.
  Uh... wow.
  You... Doin' a little hair removal there?
  Oh, uh-Yeah.
  Um... You know, feel free to say "no" to this, but...
  ...would you shave my coin purse?
  Oh, no! No way, man!
  Holy freaking God!
  - Oh! - Don't have to be so uptight about it.
  There we are. Balder than Michael Chiklis-
  And bears him an odd resemblance too. I say, they could be brothers.
  Detective Vic Mackey has finally met his match.
  Just when you thought The Shield couldn't get anymore intense.
  - Hey, Mackey, your brother's here. - I'm sorry, Detective.
  - I don't have a brother. - Hello, Vic.
  Detective Scrotes. I told you I never wanted to see you again.
  Yeah? Well, I got a listenin' problem.
  Okay. We're gonna have our first fun little race.
  When I blow this whistle, I want all the parents...
  ...to throw their children into the pool.
  If your child doesn't resurface right away, they're probably just
  trying to get attention.
  - Ready? - Good luck, Stewie.
  "Good luck, Stewie. "
  That's you. That's what you sound like.
  You're mine, Brad!
  Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!
  Ew! A Band-Aid.
  I've got ya, sweetie.
  Good for you, Brad!
  - Oh, isn't he adorable? - He's much better than my kids.
  So, you think you can make me look like a fool, do you? You little
  bastard!
  Well, guess again!
  Oh, Brad! There's a piece of marzipan over here for you.
  What the deuce?
  Hell? Now, that's a bit much, don't you think?
  I mean, sure, I've spent my entire life trying to kill my mother. But
  who hasn't?
  You know, really, for hell this isn't that bad.
  - Hi, there. I'm Steve Allen. - Oh, hello.
  All right. Let's do this.
  Ah!
  I'm alive. I'm alive!
  Oh! Stewie! My baby.
  I thought I'd lost you. Oh!
  I can't believe it. All these years I thought I was living in hell...
  ...but it gets so much worse.
  This is a sign. Well, from this day forward...
  Stewart Gilligan Griffin will be a good boy.
  I don't understand. I was only gonna ask him to fix my collar.
  Huh. Well, I wonder what they got on TV in hell.
  Morning, Brian.
  Beautiful day, isn't it? Kind of day that makes you glad to be alive.
  - I made fudge. - Uh, okay.
  Wha- Uh- What, uh-
  - What are you-What are you doing? - Well, from the feel of it...
  ...working through quite a few years of stress.
  The thing is, when I died, I got a glimpse of where I was going...
  ...and, well, I did not like it one bit.
  Wow. I am so uncomfortable right now.
  So, I've resolved to change my ways...
  ...because I know now who I want to be.
  — I have confidence in sunshine —
  — I have confidence in rain —
  — I have confidence that spring will come again —
  — Besides which, you see I have confidence in me
  ——
  There you are. Drink plenty of water.
  - Hey, Brian. - Yeah?
  Thanks for listening.
  Boy, that was more disturbing than that cartoon I saw the other day.
  Shh! Be "vewy," "vewy" quiet. I'm hunting "wabbits. "
  Nyah, what's up, Doc?
  Oh, God! Oh, God!
  Oh!
  Shh! Quiet! Quiet! Your father's on.
  You know what really grinds my gears? This Lindsay Lohan.
  Eh? Lindsay Lohan with all those little outfits...
  ...jumpin' around there on stage half-naked...
  ...with your little outfits.
  You're up there jumpin' around and I'm just sittin' here with my beer.
  So, you know, what am I supposed to do?
  What do you-What do you want? You know, are we gonna go out?
  Is that what you're tryin'- Why are you... Leapin' around there...
  ...throwin' those things all up, um, over there in my face?
  Huh? What do you want, Lindsay? Tell me what you want!
  Well, I'll tell you what you want. You want nothin'.
  You want nothin'. All right?
  Because we all know that no woman anywhere wants to have sex with
  anyone...
  ...and to titillate us with any thoughts otherwise is just bogus.
  Oh! He is so right-on. Women are such teases.
  That's why I went back to men.
  Okay, Mom. Thanks for that. See you later.
  Go on.
  Another thing that grinds my gears is when I can't find the droids I'm
  lookin' for.
  Yeah, me too. What gives with that?
  And that's what really grinds my gears.
  Clear. Remove my microphone.
  - Great job, Mr. Griffin. - Great job, Peter.
  - Just terrific. - Just fantastic.
  Oh, this gig is even better than that job I had...
  ...providing nighttime heat for Lara Flynn Boyle.
  Thanks so much, Peter.
  - I was getting a little chilly. - No sweat, Lara.
  Hey, you have yourself a fine sleep.
  - Hey, Lara. - Yeah?
  - Is Dylan McDermott nice in person? - Yeah.
  Good.
  So, who would like to say the blessing?
  No one? Okay. I'll do it.
  Um, dear Lord...
  ...we thank you for this food we are about to eat...
  ...uh, thank you for this gorgeous day...
  ...and thank you for letting me share it with my good friend, Brian-
  ...that's you.
  Um...
  ...and that about covers it, I guess.
  All right. Amen.
  Sweetheart, I thought your "Grind My Gears" segment was just wonderful
  tonight.
  Yeah! I can't believe my father's famous.
  Well, honey, there's been a lot of famous Griffins...
  ...like my great aunt, Ella Fitzgerald Griffin.
  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
  I'd like to introduce my accompanist for the evening...
  ...please say hello to young Ray Charles.
  I'm blind!
  - I feel ridiculous. - Well, I can't very well fit you up here, can I?
  - Where are we going? - Well, there is the most absolutely perfect...
  ...spider web in the bushes by Cleveland's house.
  - You have just got to see it. - Oh, for God's sake.
  - Hey, Brian. Brian. - What?
  - Knock-knock. - Oh, come on.
  - Knock-knock. - Who's there?
  Your friend, Stewie- and he's always gonna be there for you.
  - Yes. Table for two. - I'm sorry. We have a 45-minute wait.
  Oh, isn't that too bad, honey?
  Because I know waiting in line at a restaurant...
  ...really, uh, grinds your gears.
  Oh, my God! It's you!
  I loved your rant about how bread is square and baloney is round.
  Oh, a table just opened up.
  - Hey! We've been waiting. - Shh! That's Michael Moore.
  Mr. Tucker, we need this table.
  But I've already ordered.
  Oh, we have a private booth set up for you. This way.
  - Griffin. - Diane.
  I can't believe we got a table at the hottest restaurant in town...
  ...without a reservation.
  We really are moving up in the world.
  Yeah, but I'd love to see what those private booths are like.
  This is totally unacceptable. How long are you going to be? I'm very
  hungry.
  Hey, B! Rupert and I were just about to-
  E- E-Excuse me. Did you just call me "B"?
  Yes, B. Rupert and I were just about to dine on this mixture...
  ...of Play-Doh and rug hair.
  - Care to join? - Oh, no, thanks.
  I just thought you might be interested in seeing this.
  This is the most absolutely perfectly destroyed spider web.
  - Where's the spider? - Knock-knock.
  - Who's there? - I ate him!
  You bastard! Who the hell do you think you are?
  Ha! I knew it. I knew you hadn't really changed.
  Okay. So, I was faking being nice. It's not the worst thing I've done.
  Ooh! Steve, it's coming right at us. Grab it!
  - I don't wanna get in the way. - It's a foul ball.
  What harm can it do?
  Look, I really don't want to go to hell, but I can't fight my nature.
  - I'm just a hateful person. - You're not hateful.
  You just need to control your anger like I do.
  You mean by being sauced all day?
  Wait a minute. Of course. That's it.
  If I'm drunk, I'll be calm. If I'm calm, I'll be nice. If I'm nice, I
  won't go to hell.
  Fix me a highball. I'm going to get good and tight.
  Look, you can't drink. You're an infant, all right?
  Besides, there are better ways to solve your problems.
  Oh, I suppose you're right. Thanks, Brian. I was weak.
  No problem.
  Oh, my God! Do you know what it's time for?
  A sexy party!
  So, Brian, I- Oh, what?
  - I didn't say anything. - L-I thought- Oh, I thought you interrupted
  me.
  - Do-Don't interrupt me! - Are you okay?
  I'm as okay as your face.
  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm s-sorry.
  So, honey, what are you going to rant about today?
  - Could we get a little preview? - Oh, I got a good one, Lois.
  Parents who let their kids do anything they want. I hate that.
  You know? Like, when I'm in a restaurant tryin' to enjoy my dinner...
  ...and little baby junior son-of-a-bitch over there is screaming his
  head off.
  Parents need to control their kids.
  Hey! Everybody, look! I'm gonna do- I'm gonna do something...
  ...that's gonna freak you out.
  I'm gonna jump from this shelf to my high chair.
  I'm gonna jump. You- Are y-you watching? Are you? Are you?
  Stewie, don't interrupt. It grinds my gears when you do that.
  Oh! He said it!
  You're gon-You're gonna- You're gonna miss it.
  You're gonna miss it. You're gonna miss it.
  Oh, G- Oh, dude.! Did you see th-that?
  Did you guys- Oh, man. Look at this-
  Look at this gash. Look at this gash right up the side of my leg.
  Oh-ho.! Oh.! I cut myself deep.
  - Oh.! It doesn't hurt though. - Uh, all right. Time for your nap.
  Don't worry, Lois. I'll take him. Let's go.
  God.! What- What the hell?
  Why are you drag- Why are we in here?
  It's rude to the... other people.
  - You're drunk. - You're sexy.
  Listen, you have to stop this, all right? No more drinking.
  - I'm sorry I even put it in your head. - I don't know.
  I don't even know what your problem is. I've never felt better.
  Okay, now I've never felt better.
  You know, Peter, there's gonna be a lot of people watching tonight.
  Better keep your balls on the prize- Eyeballs-
  On the ball. Eyes on the ball.
  Take two. You know, Peter, there's gonna be...
  ...a lot of people watching tonight.
  Better not screw up. Use take two.
  Don't worry about me, Tom. I'll be fine.
  We're on in three, two-
  And now it's time for "You Know What Really Grinds My Gears?"
  - With Peter Griffin. - Thanks, Diane.
  - You know what really grinds my gears? - Hey! Hey!
  Those X-ray specs you used to buy out of the comics.
  - Hey! Screw up! - I save up forever to buy these things...
  ...and when I finally get 'em yesterday, I couldn't see the inside of
  my son's belly.
  Blah! Bah! Blah!
  See, I wanted to see if he'd eaten the last Nilla wafer...
  'cause I told him I wanted it.
  - Boy, I tell ya, that really grinds my gears. - Pay attention to me!
  I'm trying to ruin you!
  You wanted to see me, sir?
  You're fired, Tom. Turn in your press pass and any other studio
  property.
  What are we doing here?
  So, you like being drunk? Fine. I'm gonna get you so drunk...
  ...you'll never wanna drink again.
  Come on.
  Cold. It's so cold.
  - Thanks, Horace. - Hey, is he 18?
  - Horace, the drinking age is 21. - Oh.
  O- Okay. Uh, uh...
  ...to the black man.
  Thanks for taking it all in stride.
  — 'Cause suicide is painless —
  — It brings on many changes —
  — And I can take or leave it —
  — If I please ——
  Was that- Was that good?
  Oh, God. Thank you, man.
  G- Get the fruit. There's more points.
  - Get- Get the- Get the fruit. - I'm not gonna get the fruit.
  - Get the fruit. - I can't get the fruit.
  I'm not gonna get the fruit! There's a ghost right there!
  I can't believe you saved all those.
  L- Lois- L-Lois- You think Lois'll like these?
  - You love Lois! - Shut up!
  You know what? Give me your keys.
  - Oh, no. I'm fine. - No, no. Give me your keys.
  I'm fi- I'm drivin'.
  - Give me your keys. You're too drunk. - I'm okay.
  Peter- Meg- Brian. You're too- Brian, you're too drunk to drive.
  L- I-I a-am- I-
  You're right. Here. Here you go.
  Shh!
  And that's it for sports. Now let's go to Ollie Williams with
  Adopt-A-Pet of the week.
  - Who wants this dog? - Thanks, Ollie.
  And now let's go to Peter Griffin with "You Know What Really Grinds My-"
  Tom! What are you doing? You don't work here anymore.
  Well, Diane, I have an exclusive story-
  And I can't figure out how to check my e-mail from home.
  - Did you check your TCP/IPsettings? - Yes, I did, Ollie.
  - Enable cookies? - Yes, Ollie.
  - You want this dog? - No, thank you, Ollie. Roll tape.
  This was the scene at the Drunken Clam last night...
  ...as a car driven by an intoxicated infant...
  ...caused thousands of dollars-worth of damage.
  Put th- Put this on my tab.
  It was- It was, like, all slowed down.
  You know? And I was, like, "Whoa!" But I couldn't stop it.
  And who is the father of the child in that car?
  Ooh.! Tom.! Tom.! I know this. I know this.
  Tom, over here. Tom! Ooh! Ooh!
  The man you all respect so much. Your beloved Peter Griffin.
  Good thing he didn't call on me. I was gonna say "Grant Goodeve. "
  Thanks, Tom. And now, neglectful father and Quahog's newest social
  pariah...
  Peter Griffin, with another segment of"Grind My Gears. "
  - Peter. - Thank you, Diane.
  You know what really grinds my gears? People in the 19th century.
  Why don't they get with the freakin' program?
  It's called an automobile, folks. It's much faster than a horse.
  Oh. Well, it appears I've been fired.
  Well, as long as I'm no longer working here, let me tell you somethin'.
  You know what really grinds my gears? You, America.
  Fuck you! Diane.
  Hey, Tom. Catch!
  Did you miss Daddy? Did you miss Daddy?
  Oh, no. It's all right. It's- Oh, you're shaking.
  - Go away. - Huh. Little hung over?
  I am never going to drink again- Ever.
  I may have an occasional creme de menthe, but that's about it.
  Look, kid, you can't stay in bed all- Oh, God! You're nude!
  I am? What happened to my clothes?
  Good Lord! What the hell did I do last night?
  - I hope you learned something from all this. - I certainly did, Brian.
  It seems I'm still finding myself.
  Well, that's just life, Stewie. You gotta help yourself. No one's gonna
  do it for ya.
  Yes, I suppose you're right.
  It's just too bad there's not someone out there just like me...
  ...who understands me well enough to show me the way.
  Yeah. Stewie, I'm sure there's someone out there just like you.
  Yes, I've reserved a non-smoking room with a view of the bay.
  No soap in the bathroom, just moist towelettes and a sleep mask.
  And, um, could you send up a bouquet of orchids and a box ofToffifay?
  But, for the moment, I've just got to accept the fact...
  ...that I'm an angry boy who'll occasionally try to burn down a house...
  ...or toss a poison dart at his mother.
  After all, I can't let one near-death experience change my whole life,
  can I?
  I'm glad you finally figured that out.
  Although, I will say, for the record, you're a pretty fun drunk.
  Well, thank God there were no long-term repercussions.
  Oh! Got to play this one right, Roger. Can't seem desperate.
  Wait three days- that's the rule.
  Oh, God! I wanna talk to him now!
  Damn!
  Wow! This must be one of them new plasma TV's.
  - Would you like something to drink? - I'll have water, please.
  I'll have water too, but with lemon.
  - I'll have a Sam Adams. - It's 9:30 in the morning.
  And don't you have an outstanding D.U.I.?
  Yeah, but I've gotta get the taste of weed and hooker spit out of my
  mouth.
  I'll have a Sam Adams too.
  Samuel Adams- always a good decision.
  Okay, now, if I get a fax, can I stay online and still received the
  fax...
  ...without a dedicated line?
  Yeah, you can put a piece of paper in here and make, like, a phone
  call...
  ...and your friend will get another piece of paper with the same
  picture.
  Can I possibly speak to someone who didn't come to this country on a
  floating door?
  - Can I help you? - Yes. We're here to replace our VCR.
  Yeah, don't try any of your salesman funny business...
  ...like that guy who convinced me to buy that pet Tyrannosaurus.
  Okay, Patches, now fetch!
  Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.
  Ew. It's got spit all over it.
  A VCR? Let me show you something.
  It's called TiVo. It always records what your watching...
  ...so, you can re-watch anything you missed.
  Oh! Sounds fancy. How does it work?
  I'll tell ya how it works. Easy as pie, is how it works.
  I'll tell ya how it works. Easy as pie, is how it works.
  - Should I ring it up? - Hold on. Hold on.
  I think we should discuss it first.
  Some kind of palsy.
  Anyway, that's how I saved Christmas.
  Yeah, go ahead and bag this thing for us.
  Ah! Sweet, Quagmire. You got a Winnebago.
  You mean a "Wanna-bang-o"!
  How clever.
  Yeah, I'm gonna take her across the country...
  ...and bang a different broad in every state.
  - Also, gonna go to Vegas. - Oh, we went to Vegas once.
  Remember, Lois? We saw theJew Man group?
  Dad, what are you doing?
  I'm fast-forwarding through this pesky TV show so I can get to the
  commercials.
  Hi, I'm Wilford Brimley and I have diabetes.
  It hurts me to pee and it causes me to be short with my family.
  I can't sleep at night.
  The other day, I stubbed my toe and took it out on the dog.
  Two weeks ago, I ran out of vanilla ice cream and struck my wife.
  Then I find out my wife's been dead for six years.
  Who the hell did I hit?
  Lunch is ready! Come and get it!
  Hey, what do you think it is, boogers on a biscuit?
  That's prob-That's probably what it is.
  We now go live to the streets of San Francisco...
  ...with Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa.
  - Diane, is she Chinese orJapanese? - She's Japanese, Tom.
  Wow. I know a Japanese woman.
  Tom, I'm standing here amidst the heated debate...
  ...over a recent petition to change the name of the city...
  ...from San Francisco to something a little less gay.
  Excuse me, sir. What would you like to rename San Francisco?
  Well, given the wonderful shoe shopping, I would cast my vote for
  "Heaven. "
  - Who the hell was that? - What?
  I say, press the button. Make it stop. Oh, my God.
  - He looks just like me. - You know what? He does.
  - Almost looks like he could be your father. - He could be my father.
  My real father. I knew it!
  Lois must have mated with this poor fellow.
  I've got to get out to California.
  I dare say, I'd fit right in with the kids from 90210-
  ...even the older-looking one.
  Boy, that test sure is gonna be hard tomorrow.
  You said it, Donna. Hey, Andrea, can you help me study?
  - What? - I said, "Can you help me study?"
  Dylan, I fixed your socks.
  Hey, Andrea, are we still goin' to the concert?
  This used to be all orange groves, far as the eye could see.
  Okay. So, I'll pick you up at 7:00.
  Barbara Stanwyck and I used to take the trolley.
  Hey, Lois.! Thought you might be in the mood for a classic.
  — Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
  Spider-Man —
  — Spider-Man —
  — Here comes Peter on the clothesline but his name's not
  Peter —
  — It is Spider-Man Spider-Man —
  — Come on, Lois Let's get busy, maybe in the garden right
  here —
  — Spider-Man Spider-Man —
  — Touch my can with your hand Spider-Man —
  Oh! Help! Spider-Man.
  I'm being attacked by the evil rosebush.
  Ah! I'll save you, MaryJane!
  - Oh, my God! - I don't know what they're fighting about...
  ...but I think Dad's winning.
  - Go, Dad! - Kids, can we have some privacy, please?
  Yeah, you guys are more annoying than that announcer on those TV
  commercials.
  Wacky, waving, inflatable-arm-flailing tube man.!
  Wacky, waving, inflatable-arm-flailing tube man.!
  Wacky, waving, inflatable-arm-flailing tube man.!

  So, come on down to Al Harrington's...
  Wacky, Waving Inflatable-Arm-Flailing Tube Man Emporium and Warehouse.
  Route 2 in Weekapaug!
  Please forgive me, Mr. Oinkbaum. You will be missed.
  - There we are. - What are you doing?
  None of your bees wax, Ramona.
  But if you must know, I need a plane ticket to San Francisco.
  Good luck. Plane tickets are about 450 bucks.
  400- Brian, hit me in the mouth.
  - What? Why? - I hear this Tooth Fairy gives you money for your teeth.
  - Have at it. - Uh, okay.
  No, no! Don't, don't, don't! Stop. Stop.
  - Why did you stop? I said, "Hit me. " - You flinched.
  Well, of course I flinched. You were going to hit me.
  - Well, make up your mind. What do you want me to do? - Hit me.
  No, no. D-Don't.
  I'm sorry. Look, I know I'm being hard to read-
  Hey! You there! Buy this yellow drink.
  Hey, preggo. Preggo. Hey, I'm talkin' to you, tubby.
  Oh, don't you ignore me. Ooh!
  Pardon me, sir. Sir? Sir? Oh, the hell with this.
  So, we had to do it the hard way, hmm?
  Six bucks? Nice-looking wife you've got.
  Maybe I'll look her up while you're in the hospital.
  Don't forget your lemonade.
  Oh, there you are. I thought you should-
  - What are you doing? - Paying bills.
  - What bills? You have bills? - Well, there's cable and-
  - Peter pays for the cable! - It's at this, uh- It's at this girl's
  house.
  - Do you want something? - Yes. I'm still short for my trip.
  I've only got $200. I suggest you pony up the difference immediately...
  ...or I'll e-mail the contents of your hard drive to the F.B.I.
  What are you talking about? There's nothing on there.
  Stewie, why is it so hard to accept that Peter's your real father?
  Because he's an idiot.
  You remember that time he went to the Today show.
  Coming up on Today. Tom Cruise has a new movie. We're gonna be talking
  to him.
  Katie.
  - Funnyman Al Franken will be stopping by for a visit. - Katie!
  - And Wolfgang Puck shares his recipe for apple strudel. - Katie!
  So stay tuned because we've got all this and more coming up in the next
  hour.
  Katie!
  - What? - Oh, well, never mind.
  - Care to join me, Lois? - Ah!
  Uh, Peter, how am I supposed to-
  - Oh, oh, oh. Sorry. Sorry. Where are my manners? - Oh, What a
  gentleman.
  There ya go.
  - Oh! Oh, God. You okay, honey? - Yeah, I'm all right.
  Oh, this is nice.
  Mom, Meg says Omar Sharif is dead, but I think she's thinkin' of
  Anthony Quinn.
  Chris, your father and I are in the tub.
  And, Meg, you are thinking of Anthony Quinn. Now, get out!
  Peter, this is ridiculous. We have no privacy here.
  We gotta get those kids outta the house once in a while.
  - Shouldn't they be dating? - Aw, that doesn't solve the problem, Lois.
  If they start datin', I mean, their rooms are right next to each other.
  They'll start havin' sex. We'll never get 'em outta the house.
  No, no, you idiot. I'm talking about them dating other people.
  Look, I'm gonna start spending some time with Chris...
  ...and I'll show him how to attract a woman.
  Yeah, and I'll spend some time with Meg.
  I've spent lots of time with her...
  ...like when we went on our last crusade to find the Holy Grail.
  - Choose wisely. - Uh, I choose this one.
  - How did you know? - Well, I kinda figured...
  ...the coffee mug that says "Jesus. "
  - Oh, right. Right. - Pretty obvious.
  Great. Let's kiss on it.
  Come here, you.
  Oh! You bleedin'? Yeah, you're bleedin'.
  Don't tell me you're goin' to California on that.
  Bicycling is hard, but it has its benefits.
  Did you know Lance Armstrong is dating Sheryl Crow?
  You know, it really speaks to her character that she can get past...
  ...the whole "he had cancer" thing...
  ...and still find him sexually attractive.
  Really speaks to her character. L- I respect that.
  Hey, Brian, what do ya think of my sign?
  "Quagmire's Cross-country Tour. " Uh, isn't there an "O" in "country"?
  Nope. Look out, California. Here I come.
  California!
  - What are you doing? - Well, you heard Captain Syphilis.
  - We're going to California. - Oh, come on. You can't go alone with
  Quagmire.
  Look, I'll tell you what. If you're serious about this, I'll go with
  you.
  Although I should probably ask Peter and Lois if it's okay.
  Oh, they won't even know we're gone.
  Damn you, vile woman! Blast! What the deuce?
  I am a tool. Stewie is much better than me at everything...
  ...including arts and crafts and the guitar.
  I have no friends.
  - Glad you guys are joinin' me. - Did you guys see Three Men and a Baby?
  - Yeah. - There's a ghost in there behind the window.
  That's an urban legend. It's just a piece of cardboard.
  - No, it's a ghost. I heard. - You heard from who?
  - From, uh... Lois. - Yeah, right.
  - Cleveland? Death? - No. No.
  - Greased-up Deaf Guy? - He said that?
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Ow! Damn it!
  - What are you doing? - Your knight was at king's rook six.
  No, my bishop was at king's rook six. My knight was at queen five.
  - No, no, no. It was- - Yes. Yes.
  No. In your dreams your knight was at queen five.
  - I was sitting right- - I saw right-
  - Yeah- - Oh! Look at that! Look at that!
  Now your knight is at refrigerator five.
  - That's real mature. - Yeah, well, who comes out a winner? Me.
  Griffin once again.
  Undefeated champion of the world!
  You know, San Francisco is a big place.
  Have you thought about how you're gonna find this guy?
  Simple, Brian. Look at this.
  My God! This poor fellow had relations with Lois.
  That's more disgusting than my cousin Quark Griffin.
  I'm watching your every move, Quark, so don't think you can get away
  with any law-breaking.
  - Yeah, yeah. Whatever, man. - I mean it!
  - You'll have me to deal with. - Ooh! I'm really scared.
  I could morph into a giant python and eat you alive.
  Hey, here's an idea-
  Why don't you morph into a guy with something interesting to talk about?
  Kids, your mother and I have decided we're gonna help you two get out
  in the dating world.
  That's right.
  Chris, I'm gonna show you how to be an affable, desirable young man...
  ...who doesn't smell like the inside of a wool hat.
  - Why you gotta break balls? - Meg, when I get through with you...
  ...you're gonna be beatin' guys off with both hands.
  - This is gonna be so fun! - Hey! Zip it.
  Rule number one: No speakee until the man speakee to you.
  I say, are we moving on yet?
  Just hang out, little guy. I'll see you in a while.
  Oh, very well. I suppose I'll go pump the chemical toilet.
  Apparently you're about to do the same.
  What the hell is taking him so long?
  I'm missing precious time with my father.
  Which one of these is the horn?
  That's not it.
  That's not it either.
  - Do something. - I'm afraid to press anything else.
  Okay, Meg, lesson one for attracting a man.
  - I want you to shave my back. - Eew! Why would I want to do that?
  Trust me, Meg. Shave a man's back for him and he'll purr like a walrus.
  All right, Chris, now that we've talked about kissing and cuddling...
  ...it's time to practice eating out...
  ...at a fancy restaurant!
  All right, that's it.
  Listen, you pervert, what the devil is taking so lo-
  - Good lord! - Oh, Stewie. Thank God.
  That cleaning lady cleaned me out. She took all my money.
  Grab those keys over there, will ya?
  What, these keys? These keys here?
  These the ones you want? Hmm?
  Up yours!
  What the hell are you doing? Where's Quagmire?
  - He said to go without him. - We're stealing the Winnebago, aren't we?
  Oh, you can read me like a book, Brian.
  Breaker-breaker, Sidewinder. This is Party Pooper.
  Don't want to be a ratchet jaw...
  ...but looks like we've got a seat cover feeding the bears in a chicken
  coop, come on.
  Dad, why are we just sitting here?
  Just give me a minute, Meg.
  - What am I supposed to be learning about dating from... Ahh.
  Oh, my God, Dad! You farted!
  - That is so nasty! - No! No, no, Meg!
  Meg, this is crucial. All right?
  The sexiest thing a woman can do for a man is learn to love his gas.
  Love the gas, Meg. Love it!
  No, Meg! No, no! This is why we're here.
  This is why we're here. This is why we're here.
  Chris, you've gotta learn how to talk to girls.
  So I'll ask you again: What are the names of the women on Sex and the
  City?
  Uh... Carrie...
  Miranda, uh...
  Samantha and...
  ...uh, Scrappy-Doo?
  - Hit him, Endo. - Aaah! Aaah! Aah!
  Bosley? Uh, Tootie? Uh, Sheena Easton?
  Aaah! Aaah!
  Think we should go back for Quagmire?
  He'll be all right. He's resourceful.
  Damn it!
  Yeah.! Okay.! Yeah.!
  That's it.! Again.! Yeah.!
  All right!
  - Are you all right? - Never better!
  I got some pep pills from a trucker at the last stop!
  - Keeps me awake! - You took pills?
  West coast turnarounds! Trucker said to only take one, but I took all
  of them!
  - Maybe you should slow down. - Why? We're making good time!
  - We're not even on the road! - Huh?
  - I said, we're not even on the road! - Don't need to be!
  Compass says west. That's where we're headed.
  - Stewie, we're in the middle of the desert. - I know!
  Imagine the nads on those guys who did this on a wagon!
  Pioneers, Brian! We share their spirit! Manifest Destiny!
  - All right, that's it. Give me the wheel. - Go to hell!
  This is horrible.
  - I'm so thirsty. - Oh, my God, Brian. Do you see what I see?
  A Dr. Pepper machine?
  Yes! Oh, I can taste it now!
  Damn it. It was a mirage.
  Oh, a RC Cola machine.
  - Oh, that's it! I give up! - What do you mean?
  I never should have attempted this in the first place.
  - It was stupid! - Hey, hey. Come on, now.
  - You've come this far. Haven't you? - It's no use!
  Even if my real father is out there, he probably doesn't want to see me.
  You gotta see this through to the end.
  Maybe this guy is your real father. Maybe not.
  But if you don't find out, you're gonna spend the rest of your life
  wondering.
  Well, maybe you're right.
  Come on. I'll stick by you the whole way...
  ...just like I did when we were Siamese twins.
  Hey, look at that woman, Brian. She has no business in shorts.
  Hey! You have no business in shorts!
  Ooh, tortillas! Let's do soft tacos tonight.
  Well, we've taught you well, children. It's in God's hands now.
  Now go to the mall and find yourself some dates.
  Find a girl who smokes. Remember, if she smokes, she pokes.
  Bye, kids.
  - Do you think they're ready, Peter? - I don't care.
  - All I care about is that we have our alone time. - Me too.
  - Are we terrible people? - Nah, nah. We're not terrible people, Lois.
  Horses are terrible people.
  Murder! Murder!
  Well, we made it. San Francisco.
  I bet this city's filled with kooky roommates...
  ...like the kind you see all living together on TV.
  - Hey, Lion-O, what's going on? - I'm not sure, Cheetara.
  But I've got a bad feeling Mumm-Ra's up to something.
  Hmm. I'll be right back. I'm gonna use the john.
  Eye of Thundera, give me sight beyond sight.
  Lion-O, what are you doing? Snarf! Snarf!
  Oh, hey, uh- Not much, not much.
  You want to get wasted or something?
  Let's split up and try to find him.
  Yeah, I just checked in. Yeah, I might lose you. I just got in the
  elevator.
  Yeah, I'm gonna grab a shower.
  D- Did you guys eat yet?
  No- No, I'll- No, I'll just take a cab.
  You got your car?
  Do you wanna pick me up?
  Do you- Do you wanna- Do you wanna pick me up?
  Do you wanna pick me up?
  Do you wanna pick me up? Do you wanna pick me up?
  Father!
  Aah! Utedi.! Utedi.!
  Filthy creatures.
  Whoa-ohh!
  Damn! Why is there always a fruit stand?
  High-speed pursuit in progress...
  ...headed south on Powell toward Market Street.
  You heard him, people. Powell and Market. Move it!
  I feel like I've searched this whole bloody city.
  I suppose this means I'll never find the answer to who I really am.
  Oh, well. See you gents later.
  Free Tibet. No grapes. All that.
  Dude, I could have sworn that Nerf football was just talkin' to me.
  - Are you done with the arts section? - Of course.
  - Oh, my God! - Oh, dear.
  Oh, dear, oh, dear. This is not good.
  This is very bad. Very bad.
  Oh, Daddy, I knew I'd find you! I knew Peter couldn't be my real father!
  No, no, no. You've gotten it all wrong, Stewie.
  Stewie? How do you know my name?
  Because I'm not your father. I'm you.
  What the hell is this?
  Looks like an intermission, a chance to stretch the legs.
  Oh, man, I peed in this cup for nothin'?
  Dad, I just kicked over your Coke.
  I look atrocious.! Did you see my ass? Oh, my God.!
  This stinks.! I can't believe they cut my whole sex scene.!
  It was so tastefully done.!
  Peter, could you go to the concession stand? I want something to suck
  on.
  Giggedy-giggedy.!
  Hey, Quagmire, you think we got time to go outside and burn one?
  It's not over yet? How long is this thing?
  Chris, do you have a shower scene? Or do I have to keep dreamin'?
  Mmm.
  All right, we're back.
  You're me from the future? That's absurd.
  I'm afraid it's true, Stewie.
  I'm the man you dreamed you'd be when you were alone in your bedroom...
  ...planning world domination and singing Donna Summer into your
  hairbrush.
  — Tell him to just get out —
  — Nothin' left to talk about —
  — Pack his raincoat Show him out —
  —Just look him in the eyes and simply shout —
  — Enough is enough Is enough —
  — I can't go on I can't go on no more now —
  — Enough is enough Is enough —
  — I want him out I want him out that door now
  ——
  It is you- Uh, me!
  Oh, God, I have to many questions about the future. Is all food in pill
  form?
  Do they have flying cars? Did they ever find a successful vehicle for
  Ellen Cleghorne?
  I can't answer those questions. I'm not even supposed to be talking to
  you.
  - It's a violation of the terms of my vacation. - Vacation?
  Yes. In the future, people take vacations not to destinations, but to
  periods of time.
  Just last summer I went back to visitJesus Christ.
  Turns out his abilities might have been exaggerated a bit.
  I've already said enough. I should be getting back.
  You can't just leave me. I must know my future.
  Sorry. It's against the rules. Good-bye, Stewie.
  Surprise!
  Oh, this is just great.
  I can't believe it! This is the future-
  Wait a minute. Everything looks the same.
  - Well, of course. It's only been 30 years. - Where are the monuments
  to me?
  Where are my legions of followers?
  I thought I'd be absolute ruler of the world by now, far away from that
  house full of idiots.
  Sorry, Stewie. I abandoned my quest for world domination long ago.
  Well, am I at least a city councilman or something?
  - Sorry. - Oh, this is nothing like I imagined.
  I thought the future would be different...
  ...with jet packs, eco-domes and TV they can beam right into your head.
  Uh, give me Mork and Mindy.
  That's not how you sit in a chair!
  I'm late to Sunday dinner with the family.
  You'll have to wait in the car until I can send you back.
  Wait in the car? I shall do no such thing.
  - Hey, did they ever unfreeze Walt Disney? - Ugh. Unfortunately.
  Welcome back, Mr. Disney.
  - Are theJews gone yet? - Uh, no.
  Put me back in.
  Put some pants on. The kids'll be here any minute.
  In a second, Lois. I'm watching the Britney Spears comeback concert.
  Hi, everybody!
  I may have lost a foot to diabetes...
  ...but I'm still sexy, y'all!
  Now I'm gonna dance for ya!
  - Oh, Stew. My big boy. - Hello, Mother!
  She's still alive? What the hell, man?
  I brought a guest.
  This is, um, uh, Pablo, a child from Nicaragua I've been sponsoring.
  My! How wonderful!
  Me gusta Nicaragua.
  Mmm, yes. Is that where you got that leather handbag?
  Oh, I'm sorry. That's your face! Ha ha! Oh! Got you!
  Thirty years later, I still freaking got you!
  Oh, God! I feel as invincible as Superman.
  Hey there, Wonder Woman.
  Flying your invisible plane, I see.
  Boy, this is awkward.
  I'm- I'm, uh, actually in the lavatory of the invisible plane.
  - Oh. You mean, right now you're- - Yeah.
  I couldn't help but notice you didn't wash your hands in the invisible
  sink.
  Hi, everybody. Sorry we're late.
  Stop fuckin' apologizing. You sound like a fuckin' woman.
  I suppose one of you has to.
  - Oh, what a nice blouse, Vanessa. - Chris's wife.
  Oh, thanks. I'm not sure my tiny brain could've put that one together.
  Mom, I notice your hedges are pushing out onto the curb, and that's a
  violation.
  And your tags are expired, and one of your taillights is busted.
  I'm not gonna run you in, but I will if you don't give me a cookie.!
  - Here you go, sweetie. - Yea!
  Yeah, that's what that fat pig needs- a fuckin' cookie.
  Hi, Vanessa. Well, don't you look nice-
  Oh, no! I broke my hip!
  - You need some help, Dad? - No, I'm good.
  Oh, are these the pictures from your trip to Sonoma?
  Oh, my God! Oh, look how beautiful the countryside is.
  Oh, I'd love to get a house out there if I had the money!
  That was a swell vacation. Much better than that time I was stuck on
  that island with Bono.
  Bono, stop screwin' around...
  ...and open up that damn crate of food.
  I'm saving this for the starvin' children of the world in case we get
  rescued.
  Yeah, you know what? That's us. We're starvin'. Now open it up!
  - I can't do that, Peter. It's for the starvin' children.
  Aha!
  I'm just makin' sure it tastes good for the starvin' children.
  Knock knock.
  - Oh, hi, Ron. - Who is that fellow? He looks so familiar.
  It's Meg. She had a sex change right after college.
  Wow! She went to college?
  I can't stay too late. I gotta go shop for a razor.
  You know, for my face, where I grow my beard.
  We get it. You're a guy.
  - What is this one, my prom? - Oh, yes. That's Shirley Blitt.
  We couldn't do any dancing because of her club foot, but the punch was
  delicious.
  I think somebody put mango in it.
  Isn't it funny that I remember that after all these years?
  Well, there he is.
  Oh, this is fantastic!
  That's not really appropriate, Stewie.
  Oh, of course it is. I loathed that know-it-all, flea-bitten mutt.
  No, it's just that the meaning of that word has changed ever since
  President Douchebag.
  Thank you!
  I just received a call from my worthy opponent, Senator Daterape.
  No, no. He ran a good campaign...
  ...but the people of America have spoken...
  ...and they're saying they want four more years of Douchebag!
  Douchebag! Douchebag! Douchebag! Douchebag!
  That is some fuckin' good dinner, Mrs. Griffin.
  Thank you.
  Excuse me. I'm gonna go help Peter with the dishes.
  Ron, Stu, I need your help.
  I need you two to tell those parents of yours they're moving into a
  retirement home...
  'cause Mr. Empty Sac over here won't do it.
  Stu, you don't want Mom and Dad to go to a retirement home, do you?
  Well, u-uh, it's, uh-
  I- Stu, could you help me with the dishes?
  Be right there, Mother!
  Actually, Vanessa- Stu, I need your help! There are dishes everywhere!
  Oh, sorry. Must go.
  Well, I can't do it to 'em. They're my parents.
  Don't you ever want to inherit this house, you fat fuck?
  Or am I the only one who has any desire to move out from under the
  fucking power lines?
  What's that? Oh, it's cancer!
  Can we please not do this in front of Pablo?
  Ah, screw him! That fuckin' kid's from Guam.
  Probably only speaks Spanish or some shit.
  Let me tell you something, 'Nessa- a bullet sounds the same in every
  language.
  So stick a fucking sock in it, you cow!
  You can crash at my place tonight, but tomorrow we're going to get you
  back home.
  Well, welcome to Chez Stu.
  Dear God, this is where I live?
  - All alone in a filthy hovel? - Well, I wouldn't exactly say "alone. "
  Let me introduce my roommate.
  He's sometimes late on the rent...
  ...and never shy about sharing the gas bill, if you know what I mean.
  Did you just make a fart joke?
  Hey, Stu, got big plans for tonight?
  Sure do, Rupert. I'm finally going to organize my photo albums.
  Yeah, right!
  I say, what happened to his leg? Oh, wait, now I remember.
  You are gonna sit there and tell me a flat tax doesn't favor the
  wealthy?
  Not one bit, and it saves millions of man-hours...
  ...that the complexity of the current tax code wastes...
  ...which you would realize if you weren't retarded.
  Hey, give him back. Stop that. What are you doing?
  - Give me back his leg. - Oh, you'll get it back.
  This is my bulletin board where I put all my favorite comic strips.
  See, look. Here's the Lockhorns.
  Mrs. Lockhorn is saying, "We're never going to another yard sale,"
  ...because Mr. Lockhorn has clearly purchased a tuba!
  And from the look on her face...
  I'd say he's not playing it very well at all.
  You get it?
  You got these from Parade magazine?
  You read Parade magazine? Ohhh!
  Hey, Stu! It's Monday, which can only mean one thing!
  Go-Gurt Day!
  Oh, Fran, this is Pablo from Nicaragua.
  Pablo, this is Fran. She is hilarious.!
  Hey, Pablo. Just kiddin'!
  I told you! She's so twisted!
  Well, I'd better get back to my department...
  ...before Genghis the day manager makes his rounds.
  Genghis the day mana- Is that from something, or did you just make that
  up?
  - I just made it up! - Oh-ho-ho!
  Oh! All day long.
  - Well, I guess it's not all bad. - What do you mean?
  Don't be coy, you dirty horndog. You're humping Fran.
  Tell me, how many times have we gotten into those Lane Bryant stretch
  pants?
  - What? Never. - Damn right, never- What do you mean, never?
  Stewie, I've never slept with any woman.
  I've never had sex.
  All right, that's it!
  I could handle the crappy apartment and the pedestrian job.
  But now you're telling me I'm a 35-year-old, Parade magazine-reading
  virgin?
  Well, you, sir, are pathetic!
  So forget about sending me back, because I'm not leaving until we do a
  complete overhaul...
  ...on this sad thing you call a life.
  - Can I still read Parade? - No, you cannot still read Parade!
  We've got a big day of overhauling your life ahead.
  First we've got to fix up this apartment- Stop that.
  - What? - Why are you staring at my genitals?
  I'm not allowed to tell you anything about your own future, but I will
  say this-
  Enjoy your left testicle while you can.
  - What? - I've said too much.
  So, what do you think?
  I've got to hand it to you. It really is an improvement.
  And you haven't even seen the best part.
  Stress-release candles for those extra-tough days at the office.
  You don't know the half of it. On Tuesdays I work Returns.
  I bought this boom box here, and it's got this high-pitched whine.
  Well, let's have a look.
  Ha-ha! It's yours now, sucker!
  All right, now that you've got a swinging pad, it's time to bring Fran
  back here...
  ...and, um, you know.
  - What? - Well, I have no idea.
  - I thought you knew. - No, I have no idea.
  You're the adult here. I was counting on you to know the mechanics,
  because-
  Well, let's face it, as a baby all I've got to go on is beer commercial
  innuendo...
  ...and that myth about where babies come from.
  Oh, my God! The stork!
  Where's my baby?
  Sweetie, you and me are gonna make the baby.
  Which Law and Order is this?
  This is Law and Order: P.C.A.M.P.I.E.O.F. T.D. -
  Petty Crimes Against Municipal Property In Excess of Five Thousand
  Dollars.
  Oh, that kid's spraying graffiti.
  That is not gonna be cheap to have that wall repainted.
  Kids, what are you doing here?
  Mom, Dad, Vanessa wants us to put you guys in a retirement home.
  But I think it's ridiculous.
  A retirement home?
  Now, Vanessa says it's not that bad, Mom.
  She says they have people there who will wipe your bottom.
  You gotta be yankin' me. That is sweet!
  That doesn't sound ridiculous at all, Meg.
  My name is Ron.
  Oh, I wish Brian were here. He'd never let you put us in a home.
  Oh, but at least he's in a better place now.
  Wow, look at me.
  Hanging out drinking with Ernest Hemingway, Van Gogh and Kurt Cobain.
  Still, it feels like we all got here a little earlier than we should
  have.
  Well, I finally collapsed under the weight of my own genius and shot
  myself.
  I could not reconcile my passion...
  ...with the way people around me were living, so I shot myself.
  I hated the thought of my music becoming part of some bland corporate
  mechanism...
  ...so I shot myself.
  Yeah, I, uh, I got into the garbage and ate some chocolate.
  My word!
  Yes, evidently the razor wasn't invented till sometime in the late '80s.
  Okay, then let's begin.
  And here we go. And watch my hand. And one, two, three.
  Put it in, take it out. Put it in, take it out.
  — I am the monarch of the sea —
  — The ruler of the queen's navy —
  — Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants —
  — And we are his sisters and his cousins and his aunts
  ——
  Good, you've got the rhythm. Now try it with Swiss cheese. Take it from
  the top.
  I really enjoyed the movie tonight.
  - And I'm not tired at all. - Oh, yeah? Good, good.
  I enjoyed the movie too.
  Oh, hey, I hear they're extending our store hours until 9:30.
  Oh, that's, um-
  ...that's great.
  - Let's have sex! - What? - Definitely!
  I'll be right back.
  - What is wrong with you? I can't go through with this. - Why the hell
  not?
  L- I-I'm too nervous.
  I'm putting in my diaphragm.!
  - See? I don't even know what that is. - Get in there!
  - No! No! - You listen to me.
  You listen to me, Stewart Griffin.
  You march in there right now and...
  "insert your phallus into her vagina. "
  Go!
  L- I'm sorry. That's, um-
  That's never happened to me before.
  Which part? The eight seconds of sex, or the 40 minutes of crying?
  Uh, I guess both.
  Do I- Do I give you money or something?
  Yeah, I'm gonna go.
  Eight seconds! That's twice as good as you did in rehearsal.
  Stu, I heard from Juan in Car Stereo Installation about what you did to
  Fran.
  Interoffice sex is prohibited...
  ...regardless of how hilariously brief and unsatisfying it was.
  You're fired.
  - Fired? Oh, this is not good. - Oh, dear.
  This is almost as bad as when Peter got fired as the first director of
  Terms of Endearment.
  Kids, I don't have much time left...
  ...and I can't talk for too long 'cause I get real upset.
  I want you to make a lot of friends...
  ...and be real nice to the girls- They're gonna be real important to
  you after I'm gone.
  Sweet.
  Oh, cheer up. You didn't need that crappy job anyway.
  You are not allowed to speak. You have ruined everything!
  Nice. I donate my time trying to fix your pathetic life, and this is
  the thanks I get?
  Well, it's not the first gift that's ever gone unappreciated.
  Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
  Oh, Peter, thank you!
  An arcade-style Galaga machine.
  Oh, thank you, Peter-
  Move!
  Look, all right, I'll admit that maybe things haven't gone exactly to
  plan.
  We'll go home and regroup and hit 'em hard tomorrow.
  Good lord! My apartment!
  Looks like the cause of the fire were these stress-release candles.
  Huh! — Irony —
  I don't know, Peter. This place is pretty depressing.
  What are you talking about? It's just like old times. Hey, Cleveland.
  Hello...
  Peter.
  Hey, Joe, how are things since the operation?
  Oh, great, Peter.
  Who would have guessed I'd be one of the few not in a wheelchair?
  I sure do miss Bonnie though.
  It's amazing they were able to give you her legs.
  — Who wears short shorts — I wear short shorts!
  Hey, Glenn. How's the arthritis?
  Ah, not bad. Course, since you walked in I'm feelin' a little stiff!
  Giggedy-gigg- Oh! I just pooped a little.
  Oh, that's nasty.
  Um, hey, you know what I do when I'm feeling down?
  I play the glad game.
  I think about all the things that make me glad. Let's try it, shall we?
  Um... Pinwheels.
  A big wedge of cake from the fair.
  A doodad to wear in your hat.
  All right, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
  No, it's my fault.
  My whole life's been a mess ever since that near-death experience.
  - I mean, nothing goes right- - Wait, wait, wait.
  Near-death experience? At the community pool?
  - But that was nothing. - Well, that's what I thought at first.
  But around the time of my 20th birthday I started having nightmares.
  Then my therapist said I've been suppressing some very complex
  emotions...
  ...that may well have caused me to take fewer risks.
  Well, then, it seems there's only one thing to do.
  I must return to the past...
  ...to ensure I never have the close call with that lifeguard tower in
  the first place.
  Oh, I just thought of another one for the glad game.
  The first scissor cut into a fresh piece of construction paper.
  Oh, yeah!
  Here's what we do.
  You buy me one of those time-travel watches...
  ...and I'll go back to my own time and stop that near-death experience.
  - I can't afford one. I don't have a job, thanks to you. - How hard is
  it to get a new job?
  Even I had that job at the airport.
  Jonny Quest.
  Okay. Welcome aboard.
  Dr. Benton Quest.
  All right. Have a good flight.
  Hadji. Hmm.
  Um, listen, you've been randomly selected for additional screening.
  But you didn't even type anything in.
  If it were up to me, you'd be on that flight.
  But, uh, I'm gonna need you to take off your shoes and that lovely, uh,
  hat.
  - Sim-sim-salabim.! - Yeah, I'd cut back on that.
  We'll have to borrow the money from Mommy and Daddy.
  - Aaah! - Never call them that again!
  - It's Lois and the fat man! Do you hear me? - Yes! Yes!
  Smells like Head & Shoulders. But you don't have dandruff.
  - Exactly! - Ah!
  - And now here's Diane with a look at traffic. - Thanks, Tom.
  There was a major pile-up in the ambulatory wing this morning...
  ...when one of the residents vomited in the hallway.
  And in international news, I'm fairly certain that Filipino nurse is
  stealing from me.
  Oh, hey, you two.
  - What brings you here? - Lois, Pablo here needs your help.
  Can we drop the whole Pablo thing?
  - Do you think I don't remember my own little Stewie? - You clever,
  clever shrew!
  Stu, you could get in a lot of trouble for this.
  Take him back to his own time.
  Well, that's why we're here. I need a loan.
  Done. This is a secret account Peter can't access.
  I never could trust him with money.
  Like the time he spent Meg's college money on that medieval catapult.
  Hey!
  Excellent. These dominoes are set up exactly as I want them, right next
  to the good china.
  Now I'll just place this priceless Fabergé egg in the
  center...
  ...right next to my newborn hemophiliac baby.
  - Hey, those yours? - Yes.
  Oh. Those are all really nice things.
  Thank you. You hear that, Evan? We were complimented.
  Take as much money as you need, but there's a couple of conditions.
  On your way back to the past, make sure Chris never marries that bitch
  Vanessa.
  And I want a promise that I won't spend my old age in a place like this.
  Oh, believe me, Lois, I promise you will never end up in a retirement
  home.
  All right, let's do this.
  Well, I suppose this is it.
  I just hit me that if you are successful in preventing our near-death
  experience...
  ...it'll turn me into an entirely different Stu.
  Then you know what you should do?
  Since the time line is going to change anyway, you should get really
  fat.
  Go buy a whole pint of ice cream and shovel down the whole thing. I
  mean, just really pig out.
  Ooh, that's brilliant!
  Hey, and if the city thinks I'm paying this parking ticket, they are
  dreaming!
  No, I'm not really gonna do it, you know, just in case.
  - Good-bye, Stewie. - So long, Stu.
  And if anyone has any objection to this union of Chris and Vanessa...
  ...let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
  Uh, I do.
  So, don't let this keep you from enjoying the reception...
  ...where I'm sure they'll be playing the Chicken Dance.
  So enjoy the Chicken Dance.
  Damn! I overshot it!
  1974. University of Denver.
  I say, Condoleezza Rice goes here.
  Damn! I ain't never gonna let the Man get me down, crazy crackers!
  Black Panthers stand tall!
  Mmm!
  Blast! This isn't the pool either!
  But at least I've arrived on the correct date.
  Only 30 minutes before the tower falls!
  Damn! I've got to get to that swim meet!
  Huh?
  Hi. Stewie Griffin. Stewie Griffin. Hi. How are you?
  Huh?
  Smells good. Dinner's ready.
  Probably shouldn't have milked that landing.
  Don't... press that.
  Future... 35-year-old virgin...
  Fran! Fran!
  - Fran! - What the devil?
  Yes! I did it! I stopped the tower from falling!
  - Who are you? - I'm you, from the future.
  From the future? My word!
  Did they ever find a successful vehicle for Ellen Cleghorne?
  Oh, that's so funny. I asked that very same question and never got an
  answer.
  Well, then you're as disposable as she is!
  Oh, come on, my little champion.
  Oh, my God! At least have the decency to carry me, you lazy skank!
  Of course, it is comfortable-
  Hey, thanks again for explaining football to me, Mr. - Sorry. I didn't
  catch your name.
  - You can call me Ron. - Ron, huh?
  You know, I've always really liked that name- Ron.
  Oh. Oh. Oh, come on.
  Come on. Come on!
  Come on! Oh! Oh! That's it!
  That's it. That's it. Yes. Yes! Yes!
  Eat my dust, Crash Bandicoot!
  - Tom, you're on in two. - Good evening.
  For you people just joining us after fast-forwarding through the
  "movie"...
  ...to get to the extra material...
  ...we're covering the Family Guy wrap party.
  We're going live to the Drunken Clam...
  ...where Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa is having a few drinks...
  ...and reportedly loved the movie long time.
  - Tricia? - Thank you, Diane.
  I think "mildly entertained" would be the best way to describe the
  reaction...
  ...here at the after-party.
  Horace the bartender has really outdone himself with the decorations.
  There are balloons and streamers.
  Now let's get some reactions from these huge Family Guy fans.
  How'd you like the movie, sir?
  It sucked. Big whoop. Wanna fight about it?
  Who do I see about getting the last two hours of my life back?
  If I wanted to hear 81 minutes of gay bashin'...
  I would've gone to my father's house.
  Terrific. And here comes the family of the hour.
  Will there be a sequel? Is it true you're running for mayor?
  Do you think Capone and his cronies will rule the streets of Chicago
  forever?
  I'm standing here with Peter Griffin.
  Peter, congratulations on your big night.
  Thank you. Thank you very much.
  Hey, how's Mr. Eddie's father doin'?
  That's fresh.
  Peter, how do you respond to the accusations...
  ...that you were responsible for the series' cancellation?
  Well, the show had been on for a while.
  I was talking to Alan Alda, and he said the same thing that Doc Cosby
  told me-
  ...that it was my face out there, and I should take creative control.
  So I did. We pushed the envelope, creatively, and I stand by my work.
  Peter, can we cut? This isn't workin' for me.
  Who yells cut, Cleveland? The only one who yells cut is the director.
  Look, if you want me to fuck this chick, I'll fuck her.
  But don't make me go through all this bullshit.
  You're showin' a real ugly side, Griffin.
  Did I miss my cue?
  Although I probably pushed things too far when I did the incest episode.
  - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Chris.
  Wrong! It's wrong!
  Still, that said, I'm not the one who put us up against Friends and
  Survivor.
  What have you been doing since?
  I had a couple of part-time jobs that didn't work out.
  I thought you could go in the suit, like the astronauts.
  I thought you could go in the suit...
  ...like the astronauts.
  - Hey, I gotta take a leak. - Peter!
  If you open that suit, you'll die.
  Right, right. What are you trying to do, get me fired?
  And your wife Lois is looking very lovely.
  How does it feel to be back?
  It feels good. It was a very dark period for me for a while.
  - License and registration. - Fuck you!
  Do you know who I am?
  I'm afraid I don't, ma'am.
  Please give me your license and registration.
  - Ma'am, what are you doing? - I'm gonna kick your ass.
  Oww! Oww!
  All right!
  So, who's gettin' married, huh? You?
  All right, sweetheart. We're gonna have some fun.
  Here we go!
  Aah!
  How do I know if I want it if I can't taste it?
  - Do you know who I am? - Bonnie Franklin?
  Aaah!
  No, you were great! Ha-ha-ha!
  My analyst said I should take advantage of the time...
  ...and do something I'd always wanted to do, so I competed in the
  Iditarod.
  Hyah! Hyah!
  We gonna take a bathroom break?
  We gonna- We gonna, uh-
  Bathroom? Oh, God.
  So I worked on my novel and spent some time getting to know my fans.
  You know, give something back to the people who got me where I am.
  Brian, this is my friend Anne-Michelle.
  Anne-Michelle! Hey! What are you drinkin'?
  'Cause I see you already ordered the hot sauce.
  Hey, bartender, whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini
  around here?
  Now do Peter.
  Ooh, hey. Forgot my wallet. Can one of you guys get this?
  Um, I did a guest spot on The West Wing.
  It's not normally what I do, but I really got a chance to flex my
  dramatic muscle.
  I got eight guys from Tallahassee who want this bill pushed through.
  What's the latest on those refugees? They off the coast yet?
  We're getting a lot of Internet chatter. We can justify raising the
  threat level.
  What you do on your own time is not my business...
  ...but, damn it, when you're here I want you to maintain a professional
  veneer.
  I need to talk toJerry about how we're gonna spin the unemployment
  numbers.
  Get my wife on the phone! Tell her I changed my mind. The blue dress is
  fine.
  And I need the briefing for that meeting on the situation in Argentina!
  I found it! I found the cheese!
  Oh, boy! Cheese!
  I love you, cheese.
  I did a lot of things, but the thing I think I'm most proud of...
  ...is when I volunteered to entertain the troops.
  — If I could turn back time —
  — If I could find a way —
  — I'd take back —
  — Those words that hurt you —
  — And you'd stay —
  — If I could reach the stars —
  — I'd give 'em all to you —
  —And you'd love me Love me —
  —Like you used to do ——
  And, Stewie, we all know you kept busy.
  Oh, yes, it was exhausting...
  ...between shooting films and those damned talk shows.
  Hee-hee!
  Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
  I think it would have to be... Fuck.
  And what is your favorite curse word?
  Listen, cars aren't designed for women.
  The steering wheel would have two dents in it. We bring our own air
  bags. Right, girls?
  Anybody like cheesecake?
  Well, we're glad to have you back on the air.
  I'll let you all enjoy the party now.
  - Peter, is there anything else you want to say? - Yeah, I got
  something to say.
  You know, we kid around a lot here...
  ...but the truth is, we care about each other.
  We're excited to be back because we want to address some serious issues.
  - You know, do something we can all be proud of.
  Peter!
  Still got it!
  That was me. I used to think flatulence was something to laugh about.
  Truth is, 300 million Americans a day...
  ...expel gas through their anus.
  To learn more about flatulence, you can visit my ass.
  Just yankin' ya!



Title: Stewie Loves Lois

We interrupt this program with a special report.
  Quahog is seeing its worst flu epidemic in years,
  due in part to a severe shortage of flu shots.
  Let's go live to Asian flu correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Tricia?
  Diane, I'm...
  Thank you, Tricia. We now return you to Robin, Boy Wonder.
  Hey, don't worry. I'm here.
  Robin? They sent you?
  Yeah. Everyone else was busy so, uh, they sent me.
  What the hell are you going to do? You don't have any superpowers.
  Uh, I... got a cell phone.
  Oh, no bars.
  All right, who's next for a flu shot?
  Oh, that's me, I'm, uh, I'm Peter Griffin.
  Mr. Griffin, these flu shots are in short supply.
  We need to save them for the elderly.
  - Like these folks here. - Oh. Okay.
  Well, I guess I'll be heading out then and... Whoa!
  Oh, look at that.
  Oh, well, since it's already in there, you might as well,
  push down on the ol' plunger there.
  You're a monster.
  You know what was a monster? Frampton Comes Alive, 1976.
  Is there anyone you knew who didn't have that record? I don't think so.
  Bam! All right, have a good winter.
  Very well, Mr. Griffin, you got your flu shot.
  Now, if you'll just sign here...
  - Hmm, well, this is odd. - What?
  Well, you're 42 years old and it says here you've never had a prostate
  exam.
  No, but I've had other exams. Like that one in college.
  Damn it, this is too hard!
  Here's what I think of your test, Mr. Teacher.
  You just stood up to me. Congratulations.
  That was the test.
  Heaven helps the man who fights his fear.
  Okay, heart sounds good.
  All right, Mr. Griffin, I'm just going to need you to drop your pants
  and we'll check your prostate.
  Uh, what?
  Drop your pants, turn around, and lean forward.
  Um, okay.
  So, how's this work, you just feel my pulse or...
  What the hell was that?
  Mr. Griffin, that's a prostate exam.
  Shut up! You had your finger in my ass!
  That's how a prostate exam is performed.
  - Now, if you'll just let me... - Get away from me!
  Ugh. Get a tan.
  Peter, my God, you look terrible. What happened?
  I was raped.
  What?
  Dr. Hartman violated me. He took my innocence.
  Wh-What?
  Peter, that's a prostate exam.
  It's an important part of a physical for men your age.
  You sound just like him!
  ( bleep ) idiot.
  Hey, Peter, buddy. How 'bout some TV, huh?
  We now return to: Freddy got fingered.
  Oh, God.
  - Oh, God. - ...Yellow Pages.
  Let your fingers do the walking.
  Are we still going to the baseball game?
  Get that away from me, Chris.
  Stop it, Meg.
  Peter...
  I'm trying to be supportive but after all, it was just a prostate exam.
  You weren't there, Lois.
  You weren't there.
  Who's that?
  Who are you? Where's Peter?
  Where is he? You're a whore.
  Wear your whore makeup, you whore.
  - Is somebody in there? - Ocupado.
  Filthy whore. You're somebody's father, you filthy whore.
  - Hi, sweetie. - Ugh, look at her staring.
  What are you looking at, huh?
  God, I should take her out right here with these, man.
  Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring? Oh, why don't I give you a closer
  look?
  Yeah, you want some of this, Maury Po-bitch?
  Oh, oh, what's that, oh, you come back for more, huh?
  I'd freakin' drop her ass.
  Oh, an unfamiliar dog.
  Why don't you go away? I don't want to be your friend.
  Rupert! Oh, dear God, somebody help!
  Rupert!
  Give me that bear!
  Oh, honey, I'm afraid Rupert had a little injury.
  Oh, Rupert, please live. Please, I'll never be short with you again.
  W-We'll go away. W-We'll go to Hawaii. Would you like that?
  I always envisioned how it would be.
  I never knew there could be such a thing as a perfect day.
  Don't frolic too much, Rupert. Save some energy for the hula contest.
  Stewie, I have a surprise for you.
  Good as new.
  Rupert, it's really him. I don't believe it.
  You-you did this for me?
  And to help you feel better, I made your favorite dinner.
  Cut green beans...
  Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged according to size from largest
  to smallest,
  and a Scooby-Doo yogurt with Shaggy's eyes scratched out.
  Oh, it's perfect down to the last detail.
  Lois, I was wrong about you.
  Y ou're...
  you're my everything.
  Mommy loves you, sweetheart.
  Stewie loves Lois.
  Brian loves Olympia Dukakis.
  Oh, yeah, I do.
  Peter, what's the matter with you today? You're not yourself.
  Guys, I went to Dr. Hartman yesterday and...
  he did things to my fanny.
  - Peter, it's okay. - It's not okay.
  - You don't know what it's like. - You're wrong.
  I, too, have felt the cold finger of injustice on my insidey parts.
  He did it to you, too?
  I have something to say.
  Dr. Hartman violated me, as well.
  I only went in there for a physical-slash-guinea pig sremoval,
  but I turned out to be the guinea pig, for a sexual experimentation.
  You guys are a bunch of queers.
  And so am I!
  Oh, God, it was horrible! I scrubbed and I scrubbed, but damn it,
  they don't make water hot enough!
  My God, we've all been victims of Dr. Hartman's "prostate exam."
  Well, gentlemen, the abuse stops here.
  I will not turn a brown eye to this.
  I am going to sue that bastard and make him pay out the ass.
  No ifs, ands, or buts.
  I'm going to be really anal about this.
  Sphincter.
  Good morning, Lois.
  My, Stewie, you're in a good mood today.
  Well, why shouldn't I be? You saved Rupert's life and I love you for it.
  So warn the villagers, here comes the cuddle monster.
  Oh, Lois, your breasts are great.
  Well, good morning, Mr. Nipple.
  Hey, there. Must be cold in here.
  Peter, you're going to sue Dr. Hartman?
  You can't do that, all he did was give you a prostate exam.
  Are you saying I asked for this to happen?
  You know, Dad, there's this lawyer at the mall who says he'll take any
  case,
  - no matter how frivolous. - Yeah, yeah...
  and-and they also have an Orange Julius.
  Just-just trying to keep the conversation going.
  Well, whatever happens, I'm not going to stand for this.
  Too many people get away with injustice.
  Like the folks you meetin those Louisiana swamps.
  Excuse me, do you know how to get to town?
  Yeah, it's back the way you came.
  I love you, Lois.
  You know that, right?
  Just in case, I'll say it again. I love you.
  Oh, you are just so cute, sweetie.
  Look at that little foot. I'm gonna eat that foot.
  Give me that foot, it looks delicious.
  Don't-don't eat my foot. Oh, God.
  Oh, it is so hard to find funny women, and you are hilarious.
  Oh, you're like a female Bonnie Hunt.
  Sit right there, honey. Mommy'll go get Rupert so he can eat with you.
  Oh, God. Thoughtful.
  - Lois, I made coffee if you want some. - Oh, thank you, Brian. That'd
  be nice.
  Uh, hey, Brian. Uh, listen, I've got a favor to ask.
  Could you, uh, could you not talk to Lois anymore?
  What?
  You know, it's just I'm tired of you hitting on her. That's all,
  it's-it's not cool.
  I was just making coffee. I didn't hit on her.
  Besides, Lois is my friend. I'll do whatever the hell I want.
  I'm asking you nicely, Brian. Stop hitting on her.
  - That's ridiculous. - I see the way you look at her.
  Sorry, I fell asleep watching Sabado Gigante last night.
  Chiste grande.
  Lois, you know what we should do right now?
  We should play restaurant with my Play-Doh.
  I'll make you a hamburger. Perhaps I'll make it blue.
  Oh, can you imagine such a world?
  Uh, Stewie, I love you, but you're wearing Mommy out.
  - Now it's time for bed. - Hey, Lois, I have a secret for you.
  You're awesome.
  Our top story : a local woman loses her sex drive
  after a $125 dinner at Alfredo's.
  But first in medical news, Dr. Elmer Hartman, beloved family doctor to
  all of Quahog,
  is the target of a molestation lawsuit.
  The trial is set to begin tomorrow.
  We now return you to Native American What's Happening!
  Hey, Rerun, you see Dwayne?
  Not today. Oh, here he come.
  How, how, how.
  Peter, I don't know how much more I can take.
  Stewie used to be so independent,
  but now he just clings to me night and day. I'm exhausted.
  Oh, look at me, I'm Lois. The sun revolves around me.
  I'm the one who's got to go to court tomorrow.
  Peter, isn't there anything I can do to talk you out of this lawsuit?
  Hey, I was violated sexually and that man is going to pay.
  And I suppose it wouldn't matter if I told you for the 50th time
  that it's a legitimate medical procedure to test for cancer.
  Lois.
  L ois.
  Lois.

  Mummy.
  Mum-ma.
  Mum-ma.
  - Mum-ma. - What?!
  Hi.
  Is it not true that you went to see Dr. Hartman
  for a simple prostate exam?
  No, I went for a flu shot.
  At first, I thought he was nice and that he was kind of handsome.
  I trusted him
  and then, he told me to bend over.
  And then, I just felt like something was wrong.
  I tried to get him to stop, but he kept saying,
"Relax, I'm a doctor."
- This is ridiculous, that never happened. - Sit down, you rapist!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to wait until I've heard everything.
Go ahead, Mr. Griffin.
And that's when things got bad.
He made me feel so dirty.
Relax...
I'm a doctor.
Your Honor, I can't believe you're even listening to this.
For God's sake, you're a patient of mine.
I gave you a prostate exam last year, don't you remember?
Come to think of it,
I remember it as a pretty standard exam.
Are you sure, Judge?
Are you sure it wasn't all evil and grainy and black and white? Think
  about it.
  Relax.
  I be a doctor.
  Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty!
  Dr. Hartman, your medical license is hereby revoked.
  That's outrageous!
  God, I've looked forward to this moment more than the second coming of
  Jesus.
  Okay, everybody, uh, I know you were expecting something else,
  but as science will tell you, people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago.
  So let's try to be adult about this. Uh, no snickering and... Hey!
  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
  Okay, so if we can all be mature...
  give me the gum, we can all get through this a lot faster.
  I have so much fun when we hang out, Lois,
  and I love your hair.
  We should make up a name for your hair color.
  We could call it, like, like, strawberry sunset
  or ginger maiden,
  o-o-or-or one of those hair color names that's a random noun, like
  like temptress.
  Oh, at some point, you have to let me braid it!
  Lois, what are you doing?
  Oh, my God.
  Oh, my God, what's happening to me?
  I'm like that Texas woman who gave her son brain damage
  by holding him underwater. I'm just like Barbara Bush!
  Brian, what kind of a mother has homicidal thoughts
  about her own baby? I'm a horrible person.
  Lois, you're just exhausted.
  Somehow, you've got to break Stewie of this new over dependence on you.
  Well, it's worth a try.
  Lois, I've got a surprise for you.
  You and I are going to see Eddie Money!
  Two tickets, won'em on the radio. We're gonna have a ball.
  God, he's like a totally different person,
  like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Sulu.
  Oh, no, I never should have drank those chemicals.
  Hello.
  Peter, congratulations on taking down that monster Dr. Hartman.
  Yeah, what'd you do with your pain and suffering money?
  I got collagen.
  Hey, Lois, want to make out?
  Yeah, what do you think of new sexy lips Peter?
  Yeah. This is your life from now on.
  Enjoy it, lucky wife.
  I tell you, boys, this is a victory not just for my anus but for
  anuses...
  Oh, hang on, I got to go pee.
  That's a lot better. So, anyway, this is a... Oh, I got to take a leak.
  There we go. Oh, pee time.
  Peter, you're urinating unusually frequently.
  Yeah, what gives?
  If it's gale-force peeing you be doing,
  it could mean you've got barnacles on your prostate.
  Best have sick bay check below your decks.
  Wait a minute. Are you telling me I need a prostate exam?
  Aye, and soon, before your rudder jams with flotsam
  and you're dropping anchor without an order from the captain.
  How are you liking all these nautical puns?
  - Cute. - Not bad. - Somewhat entertaining.
  My God, I'd better see a doctor.
  But no doctor in town will see you after that lawsuit.
  Well, then, I'll just find a doctor out of town.
  Listen, uh, I know I'm not a regular patient,
  but I think I have some trouble with my prostate.
  - So can you help me out, Dr. McCoy? - What, so you can sue me, too?
  - Oh, come on, it'll only take a sec. - Forget it. I'm a doctor, not a
  patsy.
  Hello.
  Lois, what are you doing? I want to sleep in your bed.
  Good night, honey. I love you.
  This is for your own good.
  Lois, wh-wh-where are you going?
  Lois... Lois.
  Lois, answer me!
  Damn you, I will not be ignored! Get back in here!
  Get back in here and love me!
  Lois!
  Maybe I should go in. He's so upset.
  He's just being melodramatic. You've got to ignore it if you really
  want to help him.
  - Are you flexing? - What, me?
  Ha, no. Wha... why-why would I be flexing?
  I mean, I have, uh, sort of been hitting the gym,
  so uh, if-if you wanted to see how it's going...
  What am I going to do, Seamus?
  Dr. Hartman is my only hope, and there's no way he's going to see me.
  Well, you best come up with something, Peter.
  Otherwise, this will happen to your prostate.
  You just, uh, carry a picture of a diseased prostate around with you?
  Never know when it's going to come up in conversation
  and then, who's the one who's prepared?
  I've also got a map of Middle Earth,
  a cat doing a pull-up,
  and the guys from Primus.
  These poster jokes doing anything for you?
  - Eh, hit and miss. - We should hang out more.
  I need her love. I need her love, and she's ignoring me.
  Well, let's see her try to ignore this.
  Lois, help!
  I ate this whole jar of pills that look like candy and now I feel sick.
  - You look like a jackass. - Can't hear you, Brian. I'm dead.
  All right.
  What did you do?
  Oh, that is so not cool.
  Mommy, I'm dying! I'm dying!
  I said I'm dying! Hey!
  I'm dyin'up here.
  What is this? A Tommy Lee pool party? Come on, Lois, get with the...
  Oh, my God. Stewie, are you all right?
  Oh, my sweet baby.
  And to think I ignored your cries for attention. I'm so sorry, honey.
  Never again, Stewie. I'm going to give you all the love you could ever
  want.
  Forget it, you neglectful, swag-bellied measle.
  You had your chance and you blew it. Well, now you're too late.
  I hope they charge you with child abuse for my broken arm.
  I'll testify against you just like I did against Michael Jackson.
  Stewie, did Mr. Jackson behave inappropriately toward you?
  Well, yes, but the worst part was he never called back.
  No, but in all seriousness, yeah, he was actually pretty aggressive.
  - Uh, package for Dr. Hartman? - All right, where's the package?
  Here it is.
  Uh, so why don't you go ahead and open it up and reach on in there?
  It's probably cookies or something.
  Wait a minute, there's something strange about this.
  I wasn't expecting any package. Who are you?
  Griffin!
  You got to help me, Dr. Hartman.
  I think there may actually be something wrong with my prostate.
  Well, don't look at me. I lost my license, thanks to you.
  Look, I-I know what I did was wrong, but
  you're the only one I can turn to.
  So, I'm asking you... as a man with no more options...
  will you take a look in my ass?
  Despite everything that's happened,
  I suppose I can't ignore my Hippocratic oath.
  All right, drop your pants.
  Oh, well, this is nothing. Just a little swelling. Probably a minor
  infection.
  Looks like there's some blockage.
  What the devil is that?
  Hello.
  Dr. Hartman, your license is hereby reinstated.
  Oh, I'm so glad you two worked things out.
  And to think I actually thought you raped me.
  Well, I was going to, but you ran out of the room.
  What?
  Family Guy was recorded on tape before a live audience.



Title: Mother Tucker

Oh, this is so exciting.
  Maybe we'll get lucky and see another crash this year.
  Yeah, we can get some souvenirs.
  Last year, I got an altimeter and a shinbone.
  Eh, this is boring.
  I'd rather be home watching that video from The Ring.
  Peter, don't...
  they say if you watch that video you die.
  Ah, that's a lot of baloney.
  We can build this thing together
  Standing strong forever
  Nothing's gonna stop us now.
  Look, there's Mr. Quagmire's plane!
  Ladies and gentlemen,
  keep your eye on the sky for the aerial acrobatics
  of Captain Glen Quagmire.
  Whoa, gonna need some help here.
  All right.
  Wait a minute, where...
  Oh, my God,
  where's Stewie?
  Don't panic, Lois, we'll find him.
  I'm good at picking people out of a crowd.
  Oh, gosh, this is hard.
  Um, yeah, could I get a better look at number two?
  And, number four could you step forward, too?
  Okay, uh, number five, uh, look at number one.
  Look at him like you haven't seen him in a while and you're happy.
  Okay, not too happy, not too happy.
  Pull it back, pull it back.
  Okay, and, um, number three could you say,
"Julie, I promise to get back on my feet before the baby arrives."
Julie, I promise to get back on my feet before the baby arrives.
He's good.
Yeah, he's always good, very good.
Yeah, yeah, okay, thank you.
Stewie? Stewie!
Hey, everybody, it's Weenie and the Butt here
live at the Quahog Air Show.
We're all ready for the Weenie sound-alike contest.
I don't know, Butt,
I don't think they can say my catchphrase, because...
"They no funny!"
Oh, there it is!
And if you think you can say that just like Weenie here,
you could win 97.1 dollars for the cool weekend ahead.
We have a butt.
We-we have a butt!
Cool weekends in the morning, 97.1 FM.
Cool weekends in the morning with Weenie and the Butt.

Weenie, Weenie, Weenie!
And the Butt.
And welcome back.
Uh, excuse I-I got to find a lost kid.
Can I use your mic?
That's what she said.
Whoa, you got Butt-slammed!
Listen, I could really use a hand here.
That's what he said!
Butt slam!
That's Manic Monkey on 97.1.
Manic Monkey, 97.1!
Cool weekends in the morning!
All weekend long.
Weenie and the Butt!
In the morning. In the morning.
On the r-r-radio.
FM!
Gimme that.
Stewie Griffin, will you please report to the radio booth.
Stewie Griffin.
Hey, that's quite a voice you've got there.
You ever think about doing radio?
Well, uh, I listen to a lot of radio.
Peter and Lois leave the radio on when they go out
so I feel like somebody's home.
Well, here's my card.
Call me if you're interested.
Hey, okay, we've got our first contestant.
Let's hear Weenie's catchphrase.
They no funny.
I think we have a wee-ner.
And that's Dicky the Punchline Donkey, on 97.1.
Dicky the Punchline Donkey, on Cool 97.1!
Cool weekends.
On the radio!
In the-the... morning!

Cool.

And now back to Round Table,
with Al Michaels, Harold Ramis, Ray Romano,
and Kermit the Frog.
There zoning laws are infringing on the rights of citizens...
Uh, if I might interrupt for a minute, I'd like to point out that--
You've had your time. Let someone else speak.
I haven't said a word. It was that guy.
Don't look at me, I can't get a word in edgewise.
Well, then who the hell's been talking this whole time?
Thelma!
Hello, darling.
Oh, my God, what a pleasant surprise.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Peter, I left your father.
What?
Wait, wait, wait, hang on a second.
I never see you, and then you finally come visit me
and you drop a bombshell like this?
This is just like what happened at the Peanuts reunion.
Stupid song!
What are you looking at?
Yeah, it's me.
Your old punching bag, Charlie Brown.
Everybody wish Snoopy was here and Woodstock?
Everybody wish Snoopy and Woodstock was here?
Well, they're dead!
And guess what?
I sold Snoopy the junk.
That's right, he got it from me!
I swear I didn't know how strong it was.
And now he's dead! They're both dead!
I don't give a crap about Woodstock,
but Snoopy...
Get off me, you skank!
I can't believe you left Dad.
I have needs that he didn't satisfy.
And I'm still a young woman, Peter.
82 is the new 74.
I'm putting my fine ass back on the market.
Boy, this is really going to upset my evil brother, Thaddeus.
Nyah... this will surely affect my inheritance... nyah.
Hi, I'm Brian Griffin,
and you're listening to The Lunch Hour,
serving up food for the mind.
Today's entree is politics.
What's on your mind today?
The governor's budget, stem cell research?
Give us a hot spoonful of your opinion.
Ok, we have a question from Quahog.
Caller, you're on The Lunch Hour. Can I take your order?
Yes, uh, I'll have a big helping of the pretentious crap.
Whoa, sometimes the, uh, crazy ones get through.
Okay, we have Rose, from Cranston, on the phone.
Welcome, Rose, can I take your order?
Um, yes, that turkey, that- that raw turkey that you ate
off the counter last week that got Lois mad,
when you pooped that out was the timer still in there?
And we're out of time.
This has been The Lunch Hour.
Join us next week, when our guest will be Gore Vidal.
And remember, life is full of entrees,
so don't fill up on bread.
I'm going to throw you now to Weenie and The Butt
in the afternoon.
Weenie and the Butt!
Ninety-seven point one!
In the afternoon.
In the afternoon.
Oh, my God.
WQHG!
Turn it on and rip the knob off!
You're listening to the radio!
Sir, I'm very sorry.
That-that was this guy I know. He thinks he's hilarious.
He is hilarious!
I was on my way in here to cancel your show,
but the banter you did with that guy,
well, as we say in the radio business,
"If you put that on the radio, people will listen to it!"
Make him part of the show.
Oh, you-you don't want him.
He's not really a professional like me.
Listen, you get that kid in here.
We need more laughs on the show.
Well, I guess he couldn't be any worse than Tim McCarver is at
  sportscasting.
  In my view, as good as the Yankees were in the first half of this game,
  that's how as bad they've been now.
  Poor Peter, I know he's having
  a hard time with this whole divorce thing.
  I feel kind of guilty that I'm here looking for a date.
  Thelma, stop that.
  You have a right to be happy.
  And-and there's a lot of great people here
  Why don't you mingle?
  Oh, my God, Lois, you single now?!
  No, Glen, I'm here with Thelma.
  - Who's Thelma? - This is Thelma.
  I don't know if this is gonna work, Lois.
  I'm a little shy at these types of things.
  Oh, you can overcome shyness.
  Think of the spider in Charlotte's Web who had to overcome Tourette's.
  I don't know, Lois.
  I haven't met a single interesting person.
  Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker
  trying to get back on my feet
  after having my ass handed to me by my bitch of an ex-wife.
  I'm Thelma.
  I'll just be going.
  Can I get you some punch?
  Oh, no, you see, if you're one of ten million Americans like me...
  Like me.
  Like me.
  ...with a bladder control problem,
  punch just goes right through you.
  I didn't hear you come in last night.
  Did you have a good time at your prostitutes convention?
  Peter, I was just trying to help your mother meet some new friends.
  Lois, you're too nosey.
  Like that waiter at that restaurant.
  And who had the prime rib?
  I hardly think that's any of your business.
  Come on, Mom, you can't stay in bed all day.
  You got to call dad and get back together with...
  Holy crap!
  We'll have more on these new developments after this.
  I can't believe what I saw in there.
  You were messing around in what was basically
  my first apartment.
  Peter, you should be happy for her.
  She's just having fun.
  I don't see what the problem is.
  Tom is a wonderful man.
  I don't see the problem, either, but let's go to Ollie Williams
  for the inepth analysis. Ollie?
  Lady's old!
  Thanks, Ollie, over to you, Peter.
  Tom Tucker, I forbid you to see my mother.
  Peter, you can't talk to Tom that way.
  He won a local Emmy for his work with the retardeds.
  They certainly wanted to hug me.
  Maybe in time, you will, too.
  Thanks for watching, I'm Tom Tucker. Good night.
  All right, look, let's get one thing straight, Stewie.
  The only reason you're here is that my boss ordered me
  to bring you on.
  All right, this is my show, and it's a serious,
  intellectual hour of discussion and I want to keep it that way.
  Hey, no problem.
  All right, in three, two, one...
  This is The Lunch Hour with your host...
  Hey, what's up Quahog?!
  From the station that reaches the beaches,
  you're listening to Dingo and The Baby!
  Dingo and the Baby.
  97.1 Quahog!
  Oh, baby!
  What the hell are you doing?
  Wha-What the hell does that have to do with anything?
  They're just wacky sounds, you know to liven things up.
  D-i-n-g-o!
  D-D-Dingo! Dingo and the...
  Baby!
  Oh, sexy girlfriend!
  Peter, would you stop spying on your mother's date?
  I can't stand it anymore, Lois.
  I'm going to put a stop to this.
  Hello?
  Uh, hello, yes, uh, this is, uh, this is Tom Tucker's personal
  physician,
  Dr. T and the Women.
  Um, could you tell Tom his contagious penis cancer medicine is ready.
  Is this Peter?
  Uh, no, it's, uh, uh, Lois.
  Uh, Lois, don't crank call my mother.
  I'm gonna have to pinch you for that.
  Ow, Peter, don't pinch me!
  Ow!
  Ow... stop it!
  Knock it off, damn it!
  Cut it out. Maybe I'll tickle you, huh, how about that?!
  No, don't.
  Here you go, tickle, tickle.
  Cut it out!
  Stop it!
  I mean it! I mean it!
  Well, I told you to stop!
  I tickle you, you hit me in the head with a frying pan?!
  I told you to stop!
  I taste blood!
  Well, there's a lot of it.
  Hey there, champ.
  Peter, I know this is all a big adjustment for you,
  but all I want is for your mom to be happy.
  Well, why can't she go back with my dad?
  Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna do
  my best to make her even happier than those kids
  on Three Wishes with Amy Grant.
  What's your wish, Billy?
  Can you cure my cancer?
  No, but how about if Spider-Man gives you
  a $50 gift card to Sears?!
  He-Here, get well.
  You know, I heard a rumor about you today?
  - You did? - Yep.
  I heard you like milk shakes.
  Oh boy, do I!
  Let's go get ourselves a shake, huh?
  I want to get a milk shake, too.
  Too bad- go get your own father.
  Hey, Carl, can I get a carton of smokes, please?
  Sure, Brian.
  And uh, what's that little rubber mailman
  you got behind there?
  Oh, you like that, huh?
  Yeah, does that thing squeak?
  Yeah, it does.
  All right, I'll take that, and I'm gonna hurry home
  and show it to Lois.
  Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere!
  You're Dingo, that dog that plays all those fart sounds on the radio!
  Awesome!
  Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry about that,
  the show's gotten a little lowbrow.
  What are you talking about?!
  It's, like, the most hilarious show ever!
  Hey, could I get your autograph?
  My... really?
  Wow, you're... gosh, you're making me feel
  more important than a dwarf among midgets.
  Hey, can you reach the Crispix?
  Yes, I can.
  How awesome is this : going out to dinner with my new family?
  Hi, can I help you?
  I want, I want that one!
  All right, hold on, we'll get you that one.
  I want straws!
  We'll get you a straw.
  You want a Kid's Meal?
  No!
  Do you mean, "yes"?
  Yes!
  Okay, one Kid's Meal.
  And what'll you have, honey?
  I'll have a fish sandwich and a Sanka.
  Oh, he's adorable.
  Say hi to the nice lady, Peter.
  Oh, he's shy.
  I don't believe in fretting and grieving
  Why mess around with stride?
  I never was cut out to step and strut out
  Give me the simple life
  Some find it pleasant dining on pheasants
  Those things roll off my knife
  Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
  Give me the simple life.
  We now return to the Sunday afternoon movie:
  Masturbator and Commander.
  Captain, the enemy ship has opened fire on us.
  I'll be right out!
  Sir, we've already lost ten men.
  Hang on!
  Sir, don't you think we should return fire?
  Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do that,
  and I'll-I'll meet you up there in like five minutes.
  Peter, I've never seen you so happy.
  Well, Lois, I never realized what it was like
  to have a real dad.
  I mean, my own dad was such a ballbuster,
  I-I guess I just always thought that was normal.
  But Papa Tom is so different.
  For the first time in my life,
  I feel like I have a real family, you know?
  I mean I'm-I'm not just going through the motions
  like I do around here.
  Hey, champ, you want to watch Chicken Little?
  Yeah!
  And what does a chicken say?
"Moo!"
Why not.
Come on, Ma!
Hey, what gives with the suitcase?
Tom, there's no easy way to say this, I'll just come right out with it.
I'm leaving.
Wha...
leaving, why?
Tommy, this has been great,
but I wasn't looking for anything long-term.
I just needed someone to clear all the bats out of my plumbing.
What do we do now Bill?
We write, Tim.
We write our story.
Good bye, dear.
It's all my fault!
Nyah!
I know it hurts right now, Peter, but we'll get through this.
You're still my little buddy, right?
Yeah.
Then we'll be okay. Good night, buddy.
Good night, Papa Tom.
Good night, son.
- Good night, Lois. - Good night.
Peter, this is a little strange.
No stranger than when Darth Vader was a meter maid.
Oh, come on, man, cut me a break!
I was only in there for like five minutes!
I already started writing the ticket.
You know, I make your annual salary in a week.
Are you happy doing what you're doing?
'Cause you're pathetic.
I got to do it, Karen.
I just... I-I got to take a shot.
That guy, that guy just got to me today.
You do whatever you think is right, and I'll support it.
I don't really understand it.
What do you want this loan for?
I want to build a giant space station that can destroy a planet.
I don't know that that would be a good investment on our end.
I mean, I want to open a sports bar.
Good morning, Quahog!
You're here with Dingo...
And the Baby...
And if you're thinking about changing the station...
Don't... you do it!
Today, we got Homeless Hank from the Dumpster out back with us.
Hey, I got an idea :
How about the first three women willing to come down
and have sex with Hank get free boob jobs
courtesy of Dr. John Viener?
Are you reading my mind, man?
Let's go to the phones.
Go ahead caller, you're on with Dingo and The Baby.
Is this Dingo?
Yes, honey, what's your name?
Sindy, with an "S."
Ooh, hot.
Oh, yeah, that's hot, that is hot.
Tell me something, Sindy, how'd you like
to come down here and get naked for us?
Sure.
I think we got a show.
Oh yeah, we got a show!
- We definitely got a show! - Oh, yeah, there's a show!
After all, AIDS is a deadly, incurable disease.
But no matter how you come to judge, Charles Wheeler
and his partners' unethical, moral, and inhuman terms,
the fact of the matter is, when they fired Andrew Beckett
because he had AIDS,
they broke the law.
My God, what is wrong with you?
I swear to God, that was supposed to be "Food Fight!"
I want some ice cream.
No, Peter, you finish your food.
You, hey, you-you get back here, right now, mister!
Don't, don't you... get down from that chair,
or you're in big trouble.
You put that ice cream back right now.
I mean it.
I am not kidding around.
I am not going to say it again.
Uh... if you put that ice cream in your mouth you're gonna be
in big trouble, young man!
Uh you... uh, uh.
I hate you, I hate you!
I want my mommy!
Well I'm the best you've got!
All right, so you know the drill.
We're going to turn on the hot dog cannon,
and for every hot dog that you catch in your mouth,
you get a $100 toward a boob job that you desperately need.
I know.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, a miss!
Aw, you got her in the eye with that one.
Whoa, that one was a teat-seeking missile!
I'm looking for Brian Griffin.
Gore Vidal!
I was supposed to do The Lunch Hour?
Uh... this is The Lunch Hour.
That one felt like my dad.
Incest in the morning.
Suppressed memories.
Ninety-seven point one!
I think I may have made a mistake.
No, no, no, no, this is it.
You're-you're in the right place.
Uh, listen, uh, why-why don't you stick around and talk for a while.
My listeners would love to hear about your new book.
Hundred dollars, boob job!
I'm, uh, going to go.
Oh, my God, what have I done?
Hey, it's all about ratings, baby, and we got 'em.
No, it wasn't worth it.
I'm sorry, Stewie, I can't do this anymore.
I'm more of a sell-out than you were when you did
those Butterfinger commercials.
Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger.
D'oh!
What's your problem?
Ah, Papa Tom's being a jerk.
At least he talks to you.
He's my dad and he hasn't paid attention to me in weeks.
Well, all-in-all, you should be thankful.
I think the Kennedys had a kid like you,
and they had it put to sleep.
Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about that business with the ice cream.
I guess I'm just still a little torn up about your mom.
But, hey, I'll make it up to you. Let's play catch.
Okay!
Wait a minute, you know what?
I think you should play catch with Jake.
Really?
Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like to have a real father.
I can't make him share his.
Well, all right, Peter, come on, Jake.
Huh, I guess I've learned a little something
about what it means to be a good dad.
Hey, Dad, do you want to play baseball?
Oh, my God, could you leave me alone!
You are the neediest kid!
I can't believe you gave up our show.
Yeah, sorry.
I wonder who they got to replace us.
It's Magic Hour with Dark Chocolate...
And The Rod.
In Rod we trust.
Ninety-seven point one!
Giggity giggity goo!



Title: Hell Comes to-Quahog

Oh, yes!
  I slam it, and you can suck it!
  Joe, that was our last ball.
  Eh, don't worry.
  Mr. Moose will help us out.
  Won't you, Mr. Moose?
  Fine.
  Knock-knock.
  Ping pong balls!
  Hey, hey, guys, look at me.
  I'm covered in balls.
  - Just like... - Just like Sharon Stone.
  Ah, you beat me to it.
  Man, I haven't had this much fun since I was in that Broadway show.
  I'm a wolverine
  And my hatred keeps me warm
  A wolverine, so you Russians best be warned
  Shooting Commies, drinking deer blood
  Peeing in the radiator
  Look up there, here comes a really angry Russian helicopter
  It has been...
  a red dawn.
  Hey, Peter, Lois called to remind you to pick up Meg at the roller rink.
  - No! - We're just getting started!
  Oh, Meg is my least favorite of all your children.
  It's all right, we'll just move the party to the skating rink.
  Who's sober enough to drive?
  Ah, okay, who's drunk, but that special kind of drunk
  where you're a better driver because you know you're drunk?
  You know, the kind of drunk where you probably shouldn't
  drive, but you do anyway, because, I mean, come on,
  you got to get your car home.
  Right? I mean, I mean, what do they expect me to do, take a bus?
  Is-is that what they want?
  For me to take a bus?
  Well, screw that.
  You take a bus.
  I'm that kind of drunk.
  Shotgun.
  Dad, where have you been?
  I've been waiting for over an hour.
  Grab some wood there, bub.
  Daddy and his friends have been drinking.
  And we're gonna keep on drinking until we each uncover
  repressed memories of sexual abuse by a trusted religious official.
  Oh, that's crazy tal... Oh, my God.
  Minister Washington, how could you?!
  Man, look at all these chicks!
  Oh, wow.
  Wow. If I were a woman, I would press my bare boobs
  up against glass in public
  just for the sexual thrill! The sexual thrill!
  How do I stop?!
  Use the rubber stoppers on the front.
  Hey, baby, how'd you like to share a pair of skates?
  Sure!
  Never mind.
  Boy, you look a lot better from the back.
  You jerk!
  Oh, hey, baby, you want to go somewhere?
  No, no, no, no, no.
  Wait, wait, Quagmire, remember what's on the other side.
  That was awesome!
  Oh, my God, that was completely by accident.
  That was great fun.
  I don't even remember why we came, but I had a ball.
  I look forward to reminiscing about this tomorrow.
  Dad! Wait!
  You forgot me again!
  You need a lift?
  Oop, didn't answer me quick enough.
  Remember those sweet, warm New England summers?
  Remember sipping lemonade underneath a shady tree?
  Remember when you hit that pedestrian with your car
  at the crosswalk and then just drove away?
  Pepperidge Farm remembers.
  But Pepperidge Farm ain't just gonna keep it
  to Pepperidge Farm's self free of charge.
  Maybe you go outand buy yourself
  some of these distinctive Milano cookies,
  maybe this whole thing just disappears.
  Meg, what happened?
  Fat Ass and his drunk friends left me at the roller rink.
  You know, this wouldn't have happened if I had my own car.
  Meg, people have always found ways
  to get around without a car.
  Look at Iceman.
  Honey, where'd you go when you went out last night?
  Uh, just over to Tom's house.
  Played some poker, had some brewskis, you know.
  Really?
  Then would you mind explaining that?
  At least they know how to touch a man.
  Oh, walk away.
  You know, Peter, maybe Meg having her own car
  - isn't such a bad idea. - Yeah, I guess so.
  What?! I have been trying to get a sewing machine for months,
  but she gets a freakin' car just like that?!
  I hate this place.
  Look at all these Hummers.
  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?
  Dude, this car kicks ass!
  And I can watch Madagascar while I'm driving!
  What kind of music do you like, Gloria?
  Hippo-hop.
  Dude, those animals are so fucking funny,
  they make me want to merge without looking!
  Yeah! Rumsfeld!
  Hi, there, can I help you folks?
  Yeah, uh, my daughter's looking for a car
  that goes with her personality.
  Yes, are the new bulimic cutting mobiles in yet?
  This is a 1996 sedan.
  Excellent gas mileage, air bags and AM/FM cassette.
  I love it!
  Dad, this is the car.
  Eh, hang on a second, Meg.
  What can you tell me about this one?
  Oh, that's just an old tank I use
  for those commercials where I declare war on high prices.
  Now, about that sedan...
  Hang on there, slick.
  Now I see your game.
  We come in here wanting a practical car,
  but then you dangle this tank in front of me
  and expect me to walk away.
  Now, I may be an idiot,
  but there is one thing I am not, sir,
  and that, sir, is an idiot.
  Now, I demand you tell me more about this tank.
  Well, if you're looking for quality, then look no further.
  That's more like it.
  Tell me, what are the tank's safety features?
  What a good-looking question.
  Three inches of reinforced steel
  protects your daughter from short-range missile attacks.
  I see. And does the sedan protect against missiles?
  It does not.
  Ah, you hear that, Meg?
  Yeah, it does not protect against missiles.
  See, these... these are the questions.
  This is why I'm here.
  Peter, you can't be serious.
  This is a 30-ton war machine.
  I'm still not sure.
  Did I mention the tank is a tank?
  Sold.
  Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes.
  Boccie balls!
  I bought a tank!
  Are you out of your mind?!
  Let me show you how the gun works.
  What the hell?!
  No, no, no, no, no, no...!
  Hey, Peter, can you blow that towel rack down here?
  Thank you.
  Jeff Daniels and Bill Pullman
  star in Neil Simon's
  The Even Couple.
  I ordered a pizza, I hope that's okay.
  Sure, I love pizza.
  This half of the apartment is mine.
  But if you want to come over here, that's okay, too.
  This isn't spaghetti, it's linguini.
  You're right, it is!
  I always get those confused.
  Hey, all of us are human.
  I'm glad we're friends.
  Yeah, this is really working out.
  There's no conflict in this movie!
  When are you gonna get rid of that stump?!
  I've been asking you for months to get rid of that stump!
  I'll do it, all right?! Just get off my back!
  She's gone.
  We can finally be together.
  But, Tim, I'm rooted to the ground.
  We'll find a way. We'll find a way.
  My God, it's hot.
  Brian, did you turn off the air conditioner?
  Just open a window.
  Air conditioners are harmful to the ozone layer.
  Brian, please.
  Save your hippie B.S. for the winter months, okay?
  Hey, Brian. I'm not gonna recycle this aluminum can.
  I'm just gonna throw it in the trash.
  Ha! you are earth's bitch!
  Morning, civilians.
  General Griffin reporting for breakfast.
  Dad, it's not fair.
  My money paid for that tank,
  and I haven't even gotten to drive it yet.
  Jeez, Meg, you always got to ruin my good time.
  Just like basic cable.
  We now return to Showgirls.
  - Yeah! - On TBS.
  Aw.
  All right, Meg, you got a feel for the controls.
  Now give it a little gas.
  Oh, great, it's here.
  That mirror I bought on eBay.
  Oh, my God!
  Joe, my God, what happened?
  You just ran over me, you bastard.
  I don't know where you got that thing, but I'm impounding it!
  Look at you.
  You look like a half-empty toothpaste.
  We now return to The Ghost Whisperer.
  I don't understand.
  Why do all you ghosts come to me?
  You're-you're really...
  Um, you have a knack f...
  We-we just trust you.
  I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson confiscate
  the closest thing I had to a car.
  Relax, Meg, it's not the worst thing I've ever done.
  You remember that favor I did for that park ranger?
  Hey, Boo Boo, let's see what we got in this pic-a-nic basket.
  Tell the other bears what you just saw.
  Well, I don't care.
  'Cause you know what I'm gonna do?
  I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car.
  Hey, Meg, I'll pay you a dollar a day to smell my sneakers.
  Oh! I peed and pooped.
  You know, I read that they're opening a Superstore USA across town.
  Maybe you could get a job there.
  No, no, no way. You cannot work there, Meg.
  Giant mega-stores like Superstore USA
  are ruining this country.
  They don't pay their employees a decent wage
  or give them health benefits.
  Oh, yeah, all gay guys hate Superstore USA.
  - What? - Hmm?
  Hey, I'm just trying to be ethical.
  Yeah, right. You hate all megastores,
  ever since you were petted way too hard
  by that special boy in front of Kmart.
  Doggie!
  Doggie!
  - Doggie! - Too hard.
  - I like doggie! - Too hard.
  - Doggie! - Gonna bite.
  - Doggie! - Gonna bite.
  Doggie!
  Oh, Jeez.
  Welcome to the Superstore family, Meg.
  - Glad to have you. - Thanks.
  I'm really excited to get to work.
  Now, let me just go over a few basics.
  You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime,
  no health benefits, and every day at 3:00,
  you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.
  Oh, it's nearly 3:00, now.
  Here you go.
  You're beautiful.
  I would go out with you
  if I wasn't already in a committed relationship.
  Hey, guys, what's going on?
  Oh, Peter, Superstore USA has taken all my business.
  Mine, too.
  In fact, the only guy in town making any money
  is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.
  Y'all laughed at me. Y'all laughed at me.
  Well, who's laughing now?
  What do you think of this?
  That makes you attractive.
  Yeah!
  Well, maybe now, you guys are seeing what I've been trying to explain
  to you.
  That mega store is a big, evil corporation
  that means nothing but trouble for this town.
  Aw, man, this is the worst thing to happen to this town since
  that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.
  Looks like someone's a little lost.
  Everyone, I have some bad news.
  Superstore USA has their own brewery on-site
  and can sell beer at a much cheaper price.
  So management has decided to close down.
  - You mean, I'm out of a job again? - I'm sorry, Peter.
  Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house.
  Okay, find the Easter egg.
  I know where it is. It's in your butt.
  No.
  Yeah, I know the story, it's in your butt.
  Mr. Griffin, if you'd just look on the ground for five seconds
  - I'm sure you'd find it. - Nope, in your butt.
  - Look, I'm tired of this stupid rumor. - In your butt.
  - Mr. Griffin. - Butt.
  - Mr. Griffin. - Butt.
  You know what, just get the hell out of here.
  Fine. Weirdo.
  So, how was work today, Meg?
  Oh, Peter, you lost your job
  because of the Superstore, you shouldn't blame Meg.
  And you can stop making that fart sound
  every time someone says "Meg."
  So, how was your day exploiting the town's resources, Meg?
  Meg.
  Meg.
  Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg.
  Meg.
  I'm not going to sit here and take this.
  I'm the only one in this family who has a job.
  Yeah, like she'd get paid for that.
  What did he just say to you?
  Nothing,th-there was...
  Well, it-it's like if you were...
  F-Forget it, it's nothing, Meg.
  - Hello. I'm Tom Tucker. - And I'm Diane Simmons.
  At the top of the news, Quahog is suffering it's worst heat wave in a
  century.
  That's right, Diane.
  We now go live to Ollie Williams with the Blaccu-weather report.
  How are you beating the heat, Ollie?
  - Swimmin' hole. - Thanks, Ollie.
  In other news, Quahog will be experiencing rolling blackouts
  to help meet Superstore USA's extensive power demands.
  Oh, in fact, Channel Five has just received
  this message from the Electric Company.
  Hey, you guys!
  We're gonna turn it on
  We're gonna bring you the power
  It's coming down the line, Strong as it can be, Through the
  courtesy
  The Electric Company. The Electric Company.
  Contrary to those upbeat lyrics,
  the Electric Company would like us to emphasize
  it will not be bringing you the power.
  Great, rolling blackouts.
  Now, Superstore USA is siphoning off all the city's power.
  And they cost me my job.
  Mine, too.
  Superstore USA has their own paper route.
  That new paper boy done gone and broke my sternum.
  Ah, this sucks.
  That damn Superstore's ruining everything.
  You know, instead of sitting around complaining,
  why don't we go down there and protest?
  That's a great idea, Brian.
  All we need is some magic markers, posterboard, some plywood...
  Actually, Superstore USA has all that stuff. We can just get it there.
  There's one of them now.
  Take that for stealing jobs from hardworking people.
  Dad, what the hell are you doing?
  We got a message for you.
  We're here, we're queer, get used to it.
  - Uh, actually, Peter... - Gattaca, Gattaca!
  Peter, I don't think it's working. People are still going into the
  store.
  Well, fine, then I guess I got to go in there and drag 'em out one by
  one.
  All right, who the hell is in charge...
  Ah... ah, wha-what is that I'm feeling?
  That's our industrialsized air conditioner.
  Wow.
  When I walk into Superstore USA, I get the sensation...
  that I'm standing on a mountain top
  with the wind blowing through my hair.
  My God, look at this wonderland of treasures.
  What would a guy like me have to do to be part of this magical world?
  You are trespassing on private property and I must ask you to leave.
  What? Are you out of your mind?
  Leave this lot, losers.
  Unless you want a licking.
  And we'd love to deliver that licking, right, fellas?
  - Yeah. Love it. - A lot.
  I'd love to lick a lemon lollipop in Lillehammer.
  God, I wish the power would come back on.
  Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward to this job.
  Peter, I can't believe you're working for Superstore USA.
  How could you sell out like that?
  Because, Brian, they have an industrialsized air conditioner.
  And I'm tired of sitting in balls soup.
  Look, Dad, this isn't going to be a cakewalk, all right?
  I'm your supervisor.
  Meg, Meg, I promise I'll do better at this job than I did on the SAT's.
  Come on.
  Do math.
  Dad, I need you to...
  Dad, what are you doing?
  Meg, Meg, look, Meg look.
  I am so freaking good at coloring.
  I know I'm not supposed to go outside the lines,
  but I do anyway because I like being myself.
  Dad?
  Dad?
  Dad?
  Oh, God, it's so hot.
  Uh, Brian, spit on me.
  Oh, that's nice.
  Now, tell me I'm scum.
  - How will that cool you off? - Hmm?
  God, it's awful in here.
  This is even worse than getting herpes from a toilet seat.
  Joanie, it's me.
  Oh, hey.
  You know, I had such a great time with you last night.
  Listen, there's something I have to tell you.
  I just got back from the doctor.
  I have herpes.
  I think you should get yourself checked out.
  - Oh, my God. - Will you stay?
  What?
  Will you stay with me, even knowing that I have herpes?
  Yes, I will.
  - Joanie? - Yeah?
  I don't have herpes.
  I just needed to know that you'd stay.
  You say...
  I only hear what I want to...
  I've had it, the only place in town that's got power is Superstore USA,
  while the rest of us are left to bake in the heat.
  There's got to be something we can do to take that place down.
  Don't worry, Brian, I think I've got an idea.
  Oh, yeah.
  Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find a assault rifles?
  Aisle 6.
  How about a list of known local homosexuals?
  Aisle 4.
  Meg, you're doing a great job.
  In fact, I'm promoting you to assistant manager.
  Really? Oh, my God.
  Thank you so much.
  Now, your first responsibility is to fire that employee.
  Boy, I'm a little chilly. I hope no one notices.
  But that's my dad.
  What's more important to you, your job or your family?
  And don't pick the obvious one.
  Oh, hey, guys, I was just catching up on some plunger nipples.
  Dad, um...
  Go on, Meg.
  What are you waiting for?
  Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this,
  but you're a fat ass who's completely incapable
  of performing the simplest tasks.
  But... you're also my father.
  And you're the only one I'll ever have.
  So, I'm not going to fire you.
  Mr. Penisberg, I quit.
  Penisberg?
  Yeah, yeah, get it all out of your system.
  Meg, that was a wonderful thing you just did for me.
  I can't believe this is coming out of my mouth, but...
  I love y...
  So, you got a tank.
  Big whoop. Want to fight about i...
  Huh, well, I'm glad that Superstore USA is gone.
  That place was nothing but trouble.
  And I think we learned something.
  Any problem caused by a tank can be solved by a tank.
  Dad, you were about to say something in the store.
  No, I don't think so.
  No, I'm sure of it.
  Oh, I don't know, something about Hardcastle and McCormick?
  No, you were going to say you loved me.
  You love me and you know it.
  Hey, hey, mouth, young lady.
  Well, you think you'll look for another job, Meg?
  Meg!
  Meg.
  Meg.
  Uh-oh.
  Pardon me.



Title: Saving Private Brian

All right, kids, assembly is starting.
  Now please take your seats for the following presentation by the U.S.
  Army.
  - What's up, y'all? I'm Sergeant Extreme! - And I'm Major Awesome!
  We're here to tell you how much the army kicks ass! Check this out!
  The army sounds awesome!
  And the recruiter said with any luck,
  I could get the clap from a 12-year-old Chinese prostitute.
  Wow, that's great.
  You'll be serving your country, just like American film legend Mickey
  Rooney.
  Hi. I'm former biggest star in the world, Mickey Rooney.
  And as you may know, I am totally and completely insane.
  I like to yell at mice with my shirt off.
  Sometimes I like to steal other people's scabs.
  How do I stay so crazy?
  Mickey Rooney's Crazy Pills!
  Take one with breakfast, one with lunch,
  and before you know it, you'll be up on your roof; pooping in the
  chimney.
  Hold out your stockings, kids!
  Chris, you can't join the army, you're too young.
  Besides, the army is weak.
  Now, the marines, those are the men you want to (beep).
  Are you kidding, Lois? The army's great!
  You get to save money for college, there's free food,
  and all the brown people you can rape.
  I am sorry, but he is not joining the army.
  Case closed.
  I can't believe they're brainwashing kids like Chris to serve in the
  military.
  Ah, yes, the bottom ten percent of our high school class
  is off to fight another battle.
  - You stole that from The Onion. - What?
  I read that in The Onion. About the war in Iraq.
  Well, if that's true, then I'd say they've got some sharp cookies over
  at the,
  uh...
  Wh-What is it again? The Onion?
  So if I go up to your room right now,
  I'm not gonna find a copy of The Onion, right?
  No.
  - Ow! Damn it! - That's what I thought.
  Coming this fall,
  if you loved Everybody Loves Raymond,
  then you'll love his brother, Robert, even more, in Robert.
  I bet you Debra really gave it to Ray today.
  I bet you she made a sandwich that wasn't very good, but he ate it
  anyway.
  And then she got mad at him 'cause he gave her a funny look.
  I miss Ray.
  I can't believe Chris would just buy into that army recruiter's sales
  pitch.
  We can't let him enlist.
  Don't worry, Lois, all he needs is an after-school
  activity to get his mind off the army. Just something to distract him.
  You know, like all of America gets distracted whenever a cute white
  girl dies.
  We regret to report that not all the children onboard the school bus
  survived.
  We have identified the body of one victim,
  nine-year-old Becky Gunderson.
  No, wait, that's, uh, Becky Gutierrez.
  That's not news.
  B-Brian, wha... what are you doing?
  Gymboree is that way.
  Brian, it's parachute day!
  I just want to swing by the army recruiting center
  and give a piece of my mind to that jerk who tried to brainwash Chris.
  We are gonna be so late. I'm not gonna have a partner.
  I'm gonna have to be partners with the teacher.
  It's just wrong for the military to mess with kids' minds.
  They're all gonna wind up in therapy, like Peter was.
  Every time my daughter opens her mouth,
  I just want to punch her in the face. She's really annoying.
  Uh-huh. All right, let's explore that.
  What the hell's wrong with you? Your skin's, like,
  moving around or something.
  I believe I'm having some sort of seizure.
  What kind of after-school activity should I do, Dad?
  Well, Chris, there's a lot of fun activities out there.
  For example, I used to be a horse whisperer.
  Pfft, maybe if she spent some time on the treadmill and I was drunk.
  I wouldn't, either.
  I don't think any of this stuff is right for me, Dad.
  Let's just face it... I suck!
  Sounds like you guys could use some fresh blood.
  This is my son, Chris.
  You should hear his voice. It's absolutely gorgeous.
  Like Laura Dern if she didn't look like a banana.
  He can sing?
  Yeah, runs in the family. See, look.
  I am Peter Griffin, I like fancy food
  I like reading comic books and dressing like a dude.
  Yeah, rock and roll!
  Did you hear that?
  Guys, I think we just found our new lead singer.
  Awesome!
  I'm gonna be a famous music star, like Muddy Waters!
  Muddy? Baby? Everything all right in there?
  Oh, I think I'm about to pass a kidney stone.
  Boy, I can't wait to lay into that recruiter.
  Yes, you'll be about as effective as the Wizard of Oz
  was at granting wishes.
  And, Dorothy, you wanted herpes,
  but little did you know, you've had herpes all along.
  I didn't want herpes!
  Well...
  you've got it.
  Yes, uh, I'd like to see the army recruiter.
  Oh, you'll have to have a seat. There's a 25-minute wait.
  25 minutes?
  Oh, God. All right, I better go put more money in the meter.
  Peggy, would you send in the next... Oh, you're already here.
  Say, aren't you a little young to join the army?
  No, I have that, uh... Webster disease.
  Hey, is that the M9 double-action pistol?
  Sure is. Standard issue in the army.
  - Where do I sign? - Right here.
  Did I mention there's a hundred-dollar bonus if you sign up a buddy?
  Really? Well, I think I have a surprise for somebody.
  There you are.
  Congratulations, you are both in the army.
  We're bothin... What? That's ridiculous.
  I'll tell you what's ridiculous : the Kaiser.
  Somebody should put him on a roll.
  Over, we're comin' over
  And we won't come back till it's over over there.
  Commercial!
  Damn! Play me some filler, Johnny.
  Okay, they're dead, all right?
  We're not gonna be seeing them again.
  My God!
  You are the sorriest bunch of rejects I ever seen.
  And I've seen the Bangles in concert.
  You! Where are you from, boy?
  - Quahog. - They only got two things in Quahog :
  steers and queers.
  I don't see no horns on you. What does that make you, boy?
  - Queer? - Right!
  - Oh, I got it? - Yeah.
  You find something funny, Private Dancer?
  Dancer for money?! Any old music will do?!
  Well, actually, yeah, your last little, uh, back-and-forth there with
  Stewie,
  that whole queer thing, that was actually pretty funny.
  Oh, God!
  Ooh, that's got to hurt worse than getting a birthday telegram from
  Zinedine Zidane.
  Yes?
  Bon anniversaire.
  Yo, yo, what's up, James Woods High?!
  I'm Chris, and this is our band,
  Splash Log!
  And we are gonna rock this place until...
  un... well, until about 9:30, 'cause that's when the dance is over!
  Evil monkey holds the key
  Evil Monkey's gonna get me
  I'm hiding underneath my seat for fear he'll point and show his teeth!
  Evil, evil monkey!
  Evil, evil monkey!
  Evil, evil monkey!
  Mayor West?
  Quiet, young man. Can't you see we're having a poker game?
  Now, I'll ask again.
  If I order a pizza, will anyone else have some?
  I might have a slice.
  Well, you know, I'm gonna need more of a commitment than that, Mark.
  West Side Story, Anything Goes.
  West Side Story, Anything Goes.
  Two of my favorite Broadway shows.
  Two of my favorite Broadway shows.
  Miss Saigon and Cabaret.
  Miss Saigon and Cabaret.
  Overrated, I should say.
  Overrated, I should say.
  One, two, three, four.
  Mambo!
  Griffin! You got four legs there! You better start using them!
  I'm trying, sir.
  You got five seconds to get to the head of the pack,
  or this entire platoon is gonna scrub the latrines with their
  toothbrushes.
  - Aw, come on, Brian! - Don't screw us, Griffin!
  - Yeah, come on, - don't screw us, Brian Griffin!
  Bill, how about thinking up your own jeers for a change, huh?
  Four! Three! Two!
  - Oh, come on, Brian, get up! - Time's up!
  You're pathetic, Griffin! Pathetic!
  Whose half-eaten dead bird is in this footlocker?
  Let's say hypothetically that it does belong to someone in here.
  Would admission of that allow that person to keep it?
  Private Griffin, just for that, you have to listen to one track
  from this Chris Gaines album.
  - Don't you think that's a little extreme? - Two tracks!
  It's so stupid, it's just Garth Brooks in a wig.
  - Three tracks! - Come on!
  - We can go all day with this! - Yeah, but...
  That's it! Every single track,
  plus the hidden bonus track!
  There's a hidden bonus track?
  Oh, I hope it's a ballad.
  Huh. Should I follow the knight into the dungeon
  or should I go back the way I came?
  Eh, I'll follow the knight.
  Page 37, page 37.
  Aah! Aah! I mean, go back the way I came. I didn't take my hand off the
  page.
  You seen it, Lois, right? You seen my hand on the page.
  Yeah, Peter, I seen it.
  Oh, no, not again.
  You know, I'm glad Chris found an activity he likes,
  but why do they have to use our garage?
  Come on, Lois, sometimes kids can be a handful.
  Look at Gregory Peck's kids.
  - Are we there yet? - It's crowded back here.
  - Stop touching me. - Your leg is rubbing up against mine.
  Hey! Quiet down or I'm pulling over.
  - Stop breathing on the window. - You idiot.
  That's condensation. It's on the outside.
  That's it! I will come back there and, so help me God,
  I will hit you with my ring hand.
  What the hell are you doing?
  What does it look like I'm doing? I'm leaving.
  You can't leave, man. That's desertion.
  They'll come after you like Peter went after that hockey coach.
  Oh, no clip? Oh, thought we had a clip.
  Nope. Okay. Uh, you can't leave, Brian.
  - You'll get life in prison. - I'll take my chances.
  Let me ask you this :
  when was the last time you saw something through to the end?
  - Well, I, uh... - Never, that's when!
  You need this, Brian.
  You dropped out of college. You still haven't finished your novel.
  Do you know what you lack? Discipline!
  And so you know where you'll get it? Right here in the army!
  Boy, you know what, you're right.
  Everything I've ever done I've crapped out on halfway through.
  Well, not this time. I am going to finish what I started.
  That's the spirit! You can do anything you put your mind to.
  You know, it's really hard to masturbate with you guys talking.
  Not for me!
  Evil, evil monkey! Ow!
  Chris, will you knock that off for 2 minutes? We want to talk to you.
  Take five, guys.
  What do you buttheads want?
  You've been playing with your friends long enough.
  Now it's time for you to come inside and do your homework.
  It's time for you to piss off, redhead.
  What?!
  Hey, hey, Chris, don't talk to your mother that way.
  Oh, way to stand up for your woman there, fatty.
  Chris, what the hell is going on with you lately?
  Ever since you hooked up with this band, you're like a completely
  different
  person,
  and I don't like it one bit.
  I am expressing myself!
  Now, get out of my way! I'm going to the park to loiter.
  - What the hell is his problem? - I don't know.
  He's acting worse than you did when you tried to cover your farts by
  coughing.
  Okay, welcome to the PTA meeting.
  On the subject of school lunches, I know there's been some concern
  about
  nutrition...
  We've had complaints about the soda machines...
  And I have spoken with the school board...
  Is there something you'd like to say, Mr. Griffin?
  Uh...
  Noooo...
  No.
  No, I'm good.
  All right, men.
  This obstacle course represents the final test of your training.
  Almost all of you have completed it in the allotted time.
  But as you know, as a unit, you either all graduate,
  or none of you graduate. Griffin, it's up to you.
  All right, you can do this, Brian. Come on, pray with me.
  Dear Lord...
  just stay out of our way.
  Okay, good luck.
  And... go!
  There's Waldo.
  - Fresh pepper? - Yes, thank you.
  - Oh, that's plenty, thanks. - None for me, thanks.
  My boyfriend just dumped me.
  There's a lot of fish in the sea. It's always darkest before the dawn.
  If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.
  Thanks!
  You did it, Brian! You did it!
  Oh, I say, this is an even bigger accomplishment than
  getting Minnie Driver's head to fit on screen.
  Okay, back up.
  Further.
  - Move back some more. - What?!
  Back up some more.
  I'm as far away as I can get.
  Okay, have her enter. Action!
  Damn it. Cut!
  Congratulations, men.
  You've all passed basic training.
  I'm proud to call you soldiers.
  I'm sure you'll do your country proud tomorrow morning,
  when you're all shipped off to Iraq.
  What?
  Oh, don't worry. I'm sure he means Fraggle Iraq.
  - Well, this isn't so bad. - Yes, the people are friendly.
  I say, the media has totally blown this whole thing out of proportion.
  Okay, I go in store, I throw backpack. Big boom.
  No, no, no, you are big boom. Big hero.
  Okay, right, so I throw backpack,
  come back and have big hero party with many virgins.
  No, no, no, no, no. You : boom.
  Oh, okay, okay. I put on backpack, boom.
  Then I come back, big hero, virgins.
  Okay, yeah. See you in a few minutes, big hero.
  Unit 17, this is base. Please report.
  Ten-four, everything's Charlie 40-60.
  What does that mean?
  I don't know. I just thought you're supposed to say names and numbers.
  Nobody's corrected me so far.
  What the hell was that?!
  Uh, help! Help!
  Uh, uh, I mean, ah, ah, Charlie, Tango, Cash,
  uh, 47, Victor, Charlie, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!
  Roger that. We're moving to your position.
  Chris, your father and I are very upset by this new attitude of yours.
  I don't care what you think of me!
  Oh, God, I envy that.
  I am so self-conscious about what people think of me.
  I am out of here!
  You know, I think I may have an idea what's causing this behavior,
  Peter.
  Look at all this stuff.
  Listen to these lyrics.
  "I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches."
  "I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits."
  Oh, look, they've got a translation for white people :
  "I give 110 percent when it comes to helping my community,"
  "even though I occasionally associate with some less than reputable
    characters."
  Peter, these lyrics are filthy.
  All this violent music is what's screwing Chris up.
  What the hell?
  Marilyn Manson! Is that who's causing all this?
  Yeah, it's all him or her's fault.
  Who does he or she think he or she is?
  Look, you can totally see his or her nipples.
  - That's obscene, maybe. - There's only one thing to do.
  You're right,
  we got to find this Marilyn Manson
  and I got to give that bastard or bitch a piece of my mind or penis.
  All right, it shouldn't be too hard to get ourselves kicked out.
  Right. We're just got to convince them we're not army material.
  - Ready? - All right, let's do it.
  Wow, look at how gay we are.
  I am so gay, with my gayness.
  Me, too.I'm...
  I'm a homo.
  - Any room for one more? - Hell yeah!
  All right, last resort.
  We get injured and go home with purple hearts.
  Shoot me in the foot.
  What? Shoot yourself in the foot.
  No, no, no, they can tell by the angle.
  Here, you shoot me and I'll shoot you.
  I don't think this is gonna work.
  Of course it'll work. Ready? One...
  two...
  three!
  Damn it! Oh, my God! That hurts!
  - I think you missed me. - All right, I'll try again.
  Uh, no, no, no, hang, hang on. That looks like it's painful.
  Of course it's painful! There's a bullet in my foot!
  Now get over here!
  No, no, no, no, no! I changed my mind!
  - I don't want to do it! - Come on, we had a deal!
  No, no, no, no, don't point that at me!
  No, no, no, oh, come on, this is flat out just not safe!
  Oh, you got me. Ow. Ow. Ow.
  - Let me see. - No, no, it's gross.
  - Let me see it. - No, no, I don't want to gross you out.
  Oh, ow, oh, we are in so much pain right now, the two of us.
  Oh, ow...
  Okay, that was real!
  Hey, hi, um, I'm Private Stewie
  and this is Private Brian.
  Uh, we both got shot in the foot,
  so, uh, we figured an honorable discharge would be in order
  and, uh, you could just send us back to the States.
  Getting shot doesn't get you out of here anymore.
  What?
  Yeah, we take whatever we can get.
  I mean, we got two dead guys guarding the ammunition.
  Sorry, guys, you are here until the job is done.
  Great news, everybody.
  Democracy just kicked in!
  So it's over? That seems unlikely.
  Amazing.
  There was only one man in the world with the vision to predict
  something like
  this.
  Damn.
  Laura! Laura!
  Laura!
  And the Grammy for Biggest Posse goes to...
  Ja Rule.
  What?!
  No, Madonna. "Posse."
  "Posse."
  Oh.
  All right, Marilyn Manson has to be here somewhere.
  Good thing we distracted the guard with that riddle.
  What gets wetter as it dries...?
  A towel.
  Hey, I've been had!
  Hey, look, right over there.
  Hey, Manson!
  What in the world was that for?
  - Oh, it's a guy. - That's for ruining our son.
  He used to be a sweet boy until he heard your music.
  This old story.
  If I had a nickel...
  All right, where's your son?
  I'm hiding underneath my seats for fear he'll point and show his teeth!
  Chris? We brought someone you might like to meet.
  Oh, my God, Marilyn Manson!
  Hey there, Chris. You working hard or hardly working?
  - So I see you're in a band. - Yep.
  Listen, your parents tell me you've been acting out a little bit.
  And I just wanted to tell you, rock n' roll music is cool,
  but respect for your elders is a tune we can all dance to.
  - Really? - Sure.
  And the best way to start a fun-filled day of being a good citizen
  is with a healthy breakfast rich in breads and grains.
  And fruits are important, too.
  You mean like apples, oranges and bananas?
  Any of 'em, Chris. You can't miss.
  And now, I think your parents have something to say.
  Chris, you don't really believe all the things in those song lyrics, do
  you?
  No.
  Then why you been acting like such a punk?
  I guess I don't really know.
  I think I have an idea.
  Peter, when was the last time you and Chris here did something together?
  Boy, I guess it's been a while.
  Here's something you might not know :
  Children crave structure.
  They enjoy the fun of planned activities
  in which they and their parent or guardian can share a common goal.
  Maybe you could take Chris fishing.
  What do you say, Chris? You want to go fishing with your old man?
  Do I?
  Can't go without these.



Title: Whistle While Your Wife Works

- Ow, damn it! - Peter, are you all right?
  No, no, I think you should call somebody.
  - Ma'am, are you all right? - I can't...
  breathe.
  Oh, God, I think she punctured a lung.
  Damn it, look at my foot. It's already starting to swell up.
  God, I'm looking forward to this week. Freaking swelled foot all week.
  You know, we should... You should probably go ahead and shut that off.
  Oh, hey, Quagmire, how was Florida?
  Oh, it was great.
  And guess what? I smuggled a whole bunch of fireworks back in my anus.
  Uh, Quagmire, fireworks aren't illegal here.
  You could have just put them in your car and driven them up here.
  Yeah, that's just as fun.
  All right, Meg.
  You be David Koresh and I'll be a heavy-handed FBI agent.
  Go!
  Hey, you.
  You're a crazy person. Come out of there, you.
  Quagmire, check it out.
  I took ten M-80s and stuck 'em all together.
  I call it Peter Griffin's bunker-busting
  mega-ultra-super...
  Holy crap!
  Oh, my God! You blew off all your fingers!
  What happened? Oh, my God!
  You know, no huge hurry, but I'm sort of out of juice over here.
  Bone-dry.
  There's one of Dad's fingers.
  We have to hurry! I learned in Biology
  if you get them back soon enough, they can be reattached.
  What's all the commotion?
  Hey, there's one of 'em.
  Peter, look out!
  Go on, Jesse.
  Make your peeps and poops.
  That's gonna feel good for Jesse.
  Damn it.
  Maybe if we make it mad, it'll come down here
  and we can catch it and get the finger.
  Hey, bird.
  Your poop is white and green.
  You're the laughingstock of the poop world.
  Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, I knew that would get you.
  Ah, ah, come here. You little son of a bitch, come here!
  Hey, stop, stop it, stop pecking me!
  Ah, thanks, Joe.
  Let's plant a knife on him just to be safe.
  Eh... good thinking.
  Yeah, I know how these things go down.
  Uh, hey there. We were supposed to have brunch this morning.
  Oh, yeah, sorry. I-I had a late night.
  Late night, huh?
  - What's her name, Brian? - What are you talking about?
  Oh, spare me the theatrics. I see the signs.
  The excuses for why we can't hang out, the inside-out collar.
  If I didn't recognize what was going on here,
  I'd have to be as dim as those retirees I entertain every Thursday.
  There's a hole in the bottom of the sea
  There's a hole in the bottom of the sea
  There's a hole, there's a hole
  There's a hole in the bottom of the sea
  Whoa-ho-ho, all right. We're getting a little faster here now.
  And you know what?
  I think there's something else down there in the bottom of the sea.
  Something that you'll be able to relate to.
  There's a tube in the throat of the elderly man
  In the hospital bed on the frog on the log
  In the hole in the bottom of the sea
  There's a tube in the throat of the elderly man
  In the hospital bed on the frog on the log
  In the hole in the bottom of the sea
  There's a hole, there's a hole
  There's a hole in the bottom of the sea
  Oh, whoa, what is this?
  There's a birthday cake for Mr. Cohen on the frog
  On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea
  There's a birthday cake for Mr. Cohen in the hole
  In the bottom of the sea
  Get a nurse.
  There's a hole, there's a hole
  There's a hole in the bottom of the sea
  Look, Brian, I think it's wonderful you've found a young lady
  willing to stoop to your level.
  - When do I get to meet her? - No, no, no way.
  Oh... I see. I get it, she's hideous.
  She is not hideous.
  Oh, well, let me ask you something.
  Does she have an alibi?
  For what? Why would she need an alibi?
  So you're saying she does not have an alibi?
  Well, no.
  Okay, so we've established she ain't got no alibi.
  She ugly, she ugly!
  U-G-L-Y!
  She ain't got no alibi! She ugly!
  Screw off.
  M, she's major ugly!
  O, she's fat and pugly!
  O, my God, no. The cow says "moo."
  Here's to Peter getting his fingers back.
  Thanks, Joe.
  Oh, boy, I tell you, I haven't felt this good
  since I came up with that new place to hide my porn.
  Have a good day, sweetie.
  Hey, Greg.
  Afternoon, Mr. Griffin. Mrs. Griffin out today?
  - Shoppin'. - Ah.
  Ah, she's hot.
  All right, last call, fellas. It's closing time.
  Aw, crap, I'm not even half-buzzed.
  Hey, what do you guys say we take this party on the road?
  Fine by me.
  Skinemax doesn't kick in with the really dirty stuff till about 3:00
  anyway.
  They had one on last night where the girl had a buttface
  but her breasts was immaculate.
  Peter, you sure it's okay to beat the brewery after hours?
  Relax, Joe, this is where I work.
  Besides, it sure beats the hell out of last Saturday
  when we partied with that big-horned guy from Legend.
  Hey, you guys want to go to IHOP? Get some breakfast or something?
  Oh, God, I don't know, Big-Horned Guy. It's like 3:00 a.m.
  Oh, that sucks, man, I'm wide awake. Hey, Quagmire, you want to...
  Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. Are you okay?
  - No! - I didn't see him.
  Okay, okay, guys, here's one.
  If you were God, who would you strike down first?
  Debra Messing. I find her insufferable.
  French Stewart.
  What are you squinting about? It's not even that bright.
  Yeah, he's terrible.
  What we need out there now is another Tim Daly.
  - Who's Tim Daly? - I don't even know who that is.
  - From Wings? - Nope.
  Tim Daly. He was on Wings.
  What, no-nobody here watched Wings?
  Is that the one where there's a guy and he's like, uh, he's a pilot or
  something?
  There's two guys. They're brothers and they're both pilots.
  And wasn't there a fat guy with a moustache?
  That was Roy. He's hilarious.
  - Was this a cartoon? - No, my, oh, my god, no!
  No, no, it took place in an airport. Th-Th-The thing was on for ten
  years.
  And the, and the funny repair guy was Lowell.
  It made Tony Shalhoub's career.
  - Who? - The tennis player?
  God, you know what? Screw you guys. I don't even know you.
  Crazy people. Living under a rock, don't know Wings.
  I love Wings!
  All right, I want to be very clear about this.
  You can meet her, chat for a minute, and that's it. In and out.
  Oh, don't worry, Brian. If she's as ugly as I think she is,
  I'll look at her once and then I'll go...
  ...all over the place.
  Then you'll wipe it up and then we'll go.
  Hi, Brian.
  Oh, my God. Who's your cute little friend?
  Oh, my.
  Hello. Stewie. Charmed.
  I'm Jillian. Come on in. Who wants a drink?
  So, you gonna take back what you said?
  Brian, she's stunning.
  Okay, you met her, you can scram now.
  I shall do no such thing.
  Now, why in the world would you be embarrassed about dating her?
  Oh, my God, Brian.
  I was watching something on TV about this guy named Hitler.
  Somebody should stop him.
  Are her parents brother and sister?
  Can you please leave now?
  Oh... now I get it. She's a moron.
  But a moron with large breasts you can use as mountains
  for your Matchbox cars, or whatever it is grown-ups do with large
  breasts.
  Shut up, that's not it at all.
  Say, Jillian, I love what you've done with the place.
  What is it? One bedroom, one bath?
  No, it's a whole apartment.
  Oh, God, outstanding.
  So, Stewie. Do you work with Brian at the detective agency?
  Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
  At the detective agency.
  That's got to be a tough job.
  I know Brian's work has him coming and going at all hours of the night.
  I bet it does, I bet it does.
  Okay, well, Stewie has to go now.
  What are you talking about? I want some more of Jillian's delicious
  lemonade.
  I know, it's good, right?
  I just wish they didn't have to kill so many lemons to make it.
  Oh, this is fun, eh?
  So, wait, Dupree moves in with Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon?
  But they're newlyweds, right?
  Well, that's no time to have a houseguest.
  Oh, gotta go.
  Sorry, Angela. Every Tuesday morning, I call my friend Cleveland
  and he describes every scene from You, Me, and Dupree.
  Griffin, your workout put this week is even worse than usual.
  Where the hell are those purchase orders?
  Eh, it's this bum hand. I can't type with it.
  Well, that's not my problem.
  I need to see some improvement by the end of the week
  or you're finished.
  Don't worry, I'll figure something out.
  Oh, that's going to be Quagmire
  with Along Came Polly. I gotta take that.
  All right, so as you know by this point in the story,
  Ben Stiller doesn't like spicy food.
  Well, guess what's for dinner?
  No way.
  Boy, Lois, thanks so much for coming in and helping me get my work done.
  Without you, Angela would have been all over my case.
  Oh, it's all right, Peter.
  I know it's tough for you to work with your hand injury.
  Hey, you know, uh, with you sitting there, it's, uh,
  it's kind of like you're my secretary.
  Let's not get carried away, Peter.
  Now, please, I'm trying to finish your work.
  You know, Lois, if I'm your boss, I gotta look like a boss.
  Finally, I have a reason to wear this big bow tie and cigar
  I bought at the Dress For Success store.
  Peter, if you want this work to get done...
  Lois, take a letter.
"Dear Life Cereal,"
"Where do you get off?"
"Part of a balanced breakfast and delicious?"
"Who do you think you are?"
"By now, you may have guessed I'm speaking ironically"
"and have nothing but good things to say about what you do."
"Life Cereal, do not change a thing."
"Signed, Peter Griffin. Dictated but not read."
Lois, read that back to me.
Oh, hey, Brian. Back from a hot booty call with your idiot girlfriend?
You know, think what you want, but you don't see the side of Jillian
  that I do.
  Face it, Brian, she's dumber than a Boston-area book report.
  The novel I chose to address is Oliver Twist
  by Charles Dickens.
  Queer name, right? The book was actually not bad.
  For your information, Jillian is very bright
  and she happens to be a very talented photographer.
  Oh, that is so lame.
  Every hot girl who can aim a camera thinks she's a photographer.
  Ooh, you took a black and white picture of a lawn chair
  and its shadow and developed it at Sav-On. You must be so brooding and
  deep.
  - Knock it off. - No, I want to know, Brian.
  What, specifically, do you talk about?
  Uh, a lot of things. Um...
  food,
  um...
  the new seat covers she just got for her Jetta.
  Um...
  - Real World / Road Rules Challenge. - You hate MTV.
  Pot helps.
  Look, you know, I don't have to justify anything to you, all right?
  All that matters is Jillian and I have a great time together.
  - We make each other laugh. - Fine.
  But just tell me this, Brian : does she laugh on her own
  or does she laugh only when you laugh?
  I thought so.
  Hey.
  Yeah.
  Uh-huh...
  uh-huh.
  Uh, you gotta hit, uh, DVD and then menu and then select.
  Yeah.
  Yeah, the DVD needs to be face up when you put it in.
  Uh-huh.
  You should be able to see the words Mr. 3000.
  Yeah...
  still nothing?
  Is it plugged in?
  Okay, so plug it in.
  Okay.
  Y-You got it?
  Is it... uh, okay. All right.
  No, no problem. All right.
  Uh, love you, too, Jilly bean.
  Okay.
  - What? - Nothing. I didn't say anything.
  I need a drink.
  Uh, hey, uh, Jilly bean?
  Hey, it's Brian again.
  Uh, so, yeah, um...
  so I figured we could get together tonight and maybe, um,
  do all those things sexually that we usually do.
  Um, what were those again?
  No way, gross! Oh, I mean, I mean, oh, oh, no.
  Yeah, I totally love how that feels.
  Hi.
  You know, I've been noticing you around the steno pool.
  You look good enough for a promotion.
  Peter, cut it out.
  Hey, that's no way to talk to your boss.
  Mmm, is that Pert?
  You know it is.
  Smell my Speed Stick?
  Peter, what the hell are you doing?
  Lois, I'm gonna come right out with it.
  I think it would be so hot for you and me to have sex in my office.
  Oh, my God. There is no way that is gonna happen.
  You know, it's no wonder you're so far behind in your work
  if this is how you behave at the office.
  Come on, just touch it. Touch yours.
  Peter, no. I have work to do so you can keep your job.
  Oh, look at me, I'm Lois. I'm a worker. I make stuff on things.
  Oh, I'll file these later. Oh, I got a phone. Nope, that's it.
  Geez, Lois, I thought having you here was gonna be fun,
  but so far you're a bigger buzzkill than Buzz Killington.
  Oh, man, this is the best party I've ever been to.
  Evening, everyone.
  I thought it would be very droll if we all sat down and looked at
  etchings.
  Would you like to join me, Peter?
  Uh, well, we-we're kinda partying here.
  Good! Hold this up.
  Now here's a fellow attempting to ride a bicycle.
  But he's having some trouble, isn't he?
  Would you like to know why?
  Why?
  Because he's a Scot!
  Now, who here likes a good story about a bridge?
  What the hell? Jillian, what...
  - What are you doing here? - Oh, hi, Brian.
  It was so nice of you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner.
  - I invited her for dinner? - Yes, you did.
  You wanted her to meet the family.
  Now, come here, Brian. Come sit by your friend, Stewie.
  And then, think about this :
  have you ever seen the sun and the moon
  in the same place at the same time?
  They're the same person!
  - I know, right?! - You're brilliant!
  Hey, Oogie!
  So tell us, Oogie, where'd you find this one, huh?
  You two meet at a Mensa meeting?
  No, at a Quizno's.
  We both ordered the Turkey Ranchand Swiss, no onions.
  Can you believe that?
  No, wow. What are the odds?
  Well, hey, what are the odds of finding true love anywhere in the world
  says this observer.
  Hey, you wanna know something cool?
  I threw up a lot in high school, so I don't get my period anymore.
  Wow, this is the one you've been waiting for, huh, Brian?
  Are you serious? Are you serious, Brian?
  All right, you know what, Lois, don't judge.
  Because you don't know what two people are like when they're alone.
  Come on. Let's go out dancing.
  I don't know, I'm feeling kinda cozy tonight. Kinda mellow.
  I just really want to go dancing... Oh!
  There it is again!
  What is that?
  So, Jillian, what are your views regarding homeland security?
  Do you think we should support what the president is doing?
  Well, I just think, for starters,
  that sometimes the government has things they can't tell us
  and, truthishly, we should just accept that.
  Okay, goodnight, everyone.
  Oh, say, Jillian, before you go. I forget.
  Do you know what the capital of this state is?
  Um... Rhode Island City?
  It's like she's (bleep) five!
  Thanks for hanging out with my friends, Brian.
  Hey, come on. We're-we're a legitimate couple, right?
  I-I should be able to talk with your friends.
  So then the valet pulls up and I'm all,
"That is so not my car."
But then it totally was.
- That's happened to me! - Me, too.
Cars go fast.
Oh, God.
Yeah, I tell ya, if I had a nickel for every time that happened.
- Yeah...? - What?
What if you had a nickel for every time that happened?
No, nothing. It's just an expression.
A what?
Well, I was just saying I do my share of dopey stuff.
Like, oh, this... this one time
I attended a speaker's colloquium on federal judgeships
and without realizing it,
I kept calling William Rehnquist "William Rhinequist."
Come on. I mean, how... "doi."
Anyone else have to go to the littlegirls' room?
I have new gloss!
- I love gloss! - Oh, that rocks!
Gloss rhymes with hair!
Dude, that was painful.
What are you doing here? Did you follow us?
Brian, why can't you just admit what's going on here?
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine. I'm gonna have to break it off.
But, boy, it's gonna be tougher than the reviews for Our American
  Cousin.
  Blah, blah, blah, "Lincoln assassinated,"
  blah, blah, blah, "tragedy for our Republic."
  Uh... oh, look!
"Ably performed by the entire ensemble."
That's us! That's all of us!
Morning, Lois, I need you to proof read this and collate it for me.
Peter, did you Xerox your penis?
300 times. It's a flip book.
Flip through it or you're fired.
Oh, my God! This is disgusting.
Peter, for the last time, I'm not having sex with you in this office.
Why the hell are you pushing this so hard?
Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter to "Penthouse Forum,"
and I don't wanna be made a liar in the nudie magazine of record.
All right.
If I give you 30 seconds of making out, will that shut you up?
Let's see where it goes.
Oh, God, you know this is pretty hot.
Yeah, what'd I tell you, huh?
Oh, God, Peter, let's do it.
Let's do it right here, right now!
Lois, Lois wait. Wait.
Opie's right there.
I want him to look, Peter.
Well, that is the last of it.
You are now all caught up with your work.
Lois, I really appreciate you helping me out this week,
and I really appreciate you having sex with me in my office.
Well, that was my pleasure, too, Peter.
Haa, I knew I'd get you.
Just like Danny DeVito got Rhea Perlman.
I don't know, Danny.
Look, it's either me or nobody.
Sold.
All right, Brian, you can do this. You can dump her.
Because once it's done,
never again will you have to listen to her talk like this?
You know, where everything has a question mark at the end of it?
With an upward inflection?
At the end of every sentence?
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking?
Oh, damn it. Now I'm doing it, too.
Oh, hey, Oogie.
Ooh, you look tense.
Well, uh, Jillian, there's...
something we need to talk about.
What is it?
I, uh...
just wanted to spend some time with you.
What the hell? It took you three hours to break up with her?
Uh, not exactly.
Well, what were you doing in there?
What's that smell? It smells like sweat and anger and shame.
Yep.
Life's confusing when you grow up, isn't it, Brian?
It is.
- Can we play my mix tape? - Yeah, go ahead.
Brian had sex with a really dumb girl
Now he's taking his friend Stewie
To get some ice cream in his car...
Oh, you're a poor sport.



Title: Prick Up Your Ears

We now return to Rodney King of Queens.
  - Rodney, did you take out the trash? - Um, I forgot.
  Oh, no she di-in't.
  Pizza for Adam West.
  No. You gave me Canadian bacon instead of bacon?
  This misdeed cannot go unpunished.
  Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your maker at the hands of my cat
  launcher.
  Hey, look, somebody tried to break into the dirty movie store.
  Quick, grab as many as you can before someone sees us.
  Damn, I lost him.
  All right, cats, back in the bag. Come on, Fluffy.
  Come on, Mittens. Come on, Paul.
  What a ridiculous name for a cat.
  Paul! That's a person's name.
  A person's name.
  Oh, Paul.
  Oh, man, this is going to be great.
  - Oh, are we watching a movie? - The lab results are back.
  You've tested positive for nymphomania.
  Oh, no, what should I do?
  Take two of these and call us in the morning.
  Oh, now that's not going to help her nymphomania.
  It's only going to exacerbate it.
  Oh, my God, what are you kids doing? Out. Everybody out.
  That's bogus.
  - Chris, what is this? - Genital Hospital.
  Yes, and it's inappropriate for someone your age.
  Now, if you're curious about sex, you should talk to your sex ed
  teacher.
  We don't have one. The principal cut sex ed class to save money.
  What? Well, that's crazy.
  Without sex ed, kids can wind up sexually confused.
  Just look at Michael Jackson.
  The kid in me likes the frosted side...
  but the grown-up in me likes the kid in me.
  Peter, do you know they're not teaching sex ed at Chris' school?
  Eh, let them figure it out the way I had to.
  With a can of Crisco and a shot glass. That's the natural way, Lois.
  That's the natural way.
  Well, somebody's got to step in.
  Tomorrow, I'm going down to James Woods High
  and offer to teach the class myself.
  Hey, you could really make a difference.
  Like I did when I taught money management to those drug addicts.
  There's a lot of ways for you guys to save money.
  For example, you're all shooting up, why not share needles?
  That's a no-brainer. More money in your wallet, more drugs in your
  veins.
  My second piece of advice : have as many kids as you can,
  'cause that makes it more likely that one of those kids'll grow up
  and make it big in Hollywood.
  Then who's paying the bills, eh?
  Hollywood kid.
  Class dismissed.
  Good morning, everyone.
  I'm Mrs. Griffin, your new sex ed teacher.
  Now, you've probably heard all those rumors
  that condoms make sex less pleasurable.
  While that is a fact, they also make sex safer.
  Sorry I'm late, Lois.
  Peter, what are you doing here?
  Lois, you think I'm going to miss a chance to share
  my knowledge with these fresh young minds?
  Forget it, I've missed too many other opportunities.
  - There he is. - Took you long enough.
  - Just what we need. - Hey, guys, I'm coming in.
  - Oh, God. - Oh, God.
  Oh, boy. I am not going to hear the end of this.
  - You jackass. - Now you've done it.
  Idiot.
  I know I don't fit here, but I'm just going to settle right in.
  All right, Peter, you can stay, but remember, this is my class.
  Now, there are a number of natural ways that males and females interact.
  That's right, allow me to demonstrate.
  Hey, Rainbow Brite. Hello, Shakespeare.
  I am all done writing plays for the day,
  perhaps we could have sexual intercourse?
  Count me in.
  I say, look at this. This toy has small parts.
  Why the devil would they include small parts?
  Unless...
  I'm supposed to eat them. Of course, it all adds up!
  Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth.
  Dude, you're lucky.
  If you put that under your pillow,
  the Tooth Fairy will come and give you a dollar.
  What? Did you say the Tooth Fairy comes here?
  To our house? She just breaks in like some hood?
  Yeah, she creeps into your house at night and comes into your room
  while you sleep.
  Oh, my God!
  And sometimes, just for the hell of it,
  she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair
  and places it gently on your tongue.
  Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get out of here! I got to get out of
  here!
  Stewie, calm down. Get a hold of yourself.
  Here, Brian, let me handle this.
  Calm down. Everything's going to be all right.
  Chris, you're wanted on the phone.
  Everything's going to be all right.
  Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly
  for the class today, but they were all out so I got Smucker's.
  Peter, I don't know what you think you're doing,
  but you ruined my sex ed class. There's no way you're coming with me
  again.
  Fine,
  but without my advice, those kids are going to be as hopeless as Liam
  Neeson
  when he tries to play an American cowboy.
  But, Montana, when will you be back?
  That's none of your concern. You got to take care of the offspring.
  Gonna take a fortnight at least to get this herd down to St. Louis on
  Mississippi.
  This glen's gonna be tough to traverse,
  and that river's got to be 50, 60 meters wide.
  And God knows how many fathoms.
  To hell with parliamentary procedure. We've got to wrangle up some
  cattles.
  What is going on here?
  We're all protesting the sex ed class that's being taught to our
  children.
  Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
  but the school board has voted to cancel your sex ed class.
  Look, Principal Shepherd, I know my husband acted inappropriately...
  Oh, it's not because of your husband.
  It's because you're teaching those kids about condoms.
  What? That's ridiculous.
  These students have the right to information about safe sex.
  Well, these parents don't think so.
  I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin. You're fired.
  Fired?! Oh, no.
  I can't believe they fired you.
  Can't you go down the school and try to reason with them?
  No, I'm banned from school property.
  The PTA doesn't want me around their children.
  Well, Lois, I think you did the right thing
  by trying to inform these kids about safe sex.
  And if the parents don't like it, that's their loss.
  That's the problem, though. It isn't their loss, it's the kids' loss.
  I just hope they're getting the information they need.
  All right, students, we have a special speaker today
  who's going to educate you about sex.
  Please welcome from the First Evangelical Church,
  the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood and the Opal Ring Crusade.
  Hey, kids, put your Walkmans down and listen up.
  'Cause we're going to talk about sex.
  Sex? Hang on there, Jerry.
  God, what are you doing here?
  I was just passing through on my way to see The Matrix.
  - We can relate to that. - No fake.
  Well, God, I am here to talk to these kids about sex.
  Uh-oh.
  And why they shouldn't be having it.
  That is boss.
  Hey, you kids like Mad TV?
  Well, we've got something almost as good.
  Here they are... The Opal Ring Players.
  Boy, I sure had fun at the pizza parlor tonight, Debbie.
  Yeah, Matthew, that pizza pie was delicious.
  Hey, watch out, crazy driver.
  That joker must have been from Jefferson High.
  They're our rivals.
  Well, here we are at the make-out point.
  Yeah. You want to go all the way?
  Freeze! Now, who can tell me what Matthew just did wrong?
  I mean, besides not running over that yahoo from Jefferson High.
  They're our rivals.
  He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex and he's not married.
  - Bingo. - Wow, you're pretty smart.
  - Thanks. My name's Doug. - I'm Meg.
  Now, look, let's rap for a second.
  He's sitting informally like us. Let's hear what he has to say.
  Jefferson High is our rival.
  Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it before you're married,
  even if you use a condom.
  Because not only to condoms fail 100% of the time,
  they're also majorly unsafe.
  Hey, you wouldn't put a plastic bag over your grandmother's head, would
  you?
  No.
  And that's why we're gonna be handing out these opal rings.
  These rings are a symbol of your commitment
  to refrain from sex until you're married.
  So what do you say? Who wants to be joyful?
  Who wants to be pure? Who wants to be... abstinent?
  - Wow, he makes so much sense. - I know, he's a visionary,
  like Gandhi or Mozart or Picasso.
  Ladies and gentlemen, my newest work.
  Now, I know this person looks a little mixed up,
  but, watch carefully. If I move this down here,
  and this over here,
  and this part here...
  Anyone tell who it is yet? No?
  Okay, well, what if I move this here and this here...
  Then it's Dianne Wiest.
  All right, men, your mission tonight is to stave off
  the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy.
  SpongeBob, you watch the East.
  StarScream, you take the West.
  And Man-E-Faces, you take center patrol since you have many faces.
  Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's morning.
  Is it?
  Ha! I knew it! I scared her off.
  Uh, you might want to check under your pillow.
  How did she get in?
  She must have been quieter than Britney Spears' dietician.
  Ea-Easy on those trans fats.
  N-Not everything needs gravy.
  You know, there's some carrots down at the other end.
  That-that cheesecake was for everyone.
  Her hand was right beneath my pillow.
  She could have snapped my neck if she had a mind to.
  Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be a while before you lose
  another tooth.
  I can't wait for that.
  I have to lure her back on my terms and kill her myself!
  But to catch a fairy, I have to think like a fairy.
  If you want Brian to say : "Well, that'll be a stretch,"
  text-message FAMGUY1.
  If you want Brian to say : "I'm not touching that one,"
  text FAMGUY2.
  If you want Brian to say : "Arriba!" and dance around a
  sombrero,
  text FAMGUY3.
  Enter now.
  Thanks for voting.
  Arriba!
  We now return to Laguna Beach.
  - Like, right? - I know.
  - Whatever, because "duh!" - I know, right?
  Whatever, because I mean, like, totally full out.
  - Full on. - Right?
  I guess it's not easy growing up anywhere.
  Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring. It means I made a pledge not to
  have sex.
  That's crazy! You can't give up sex. You've got a responsibility.
  You see, Meg, you're what they call a "practice girl."
  Dad, look at the facts about sex.
"If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another
  dimension"
"populated entirely by dogs who will eat it."
Well, that's something I'd like to avoid. Well, this changes everything.
From now on, I, too, will be obstinate.
- Abstinent. - Absinthe.
- Abstinent. - You're grounded.
All right, getting a tooth to lure
that damn fairy back shouldn't be too difficult.
I'd love to dance, Fred Savage.
Gosh, Meg, I really wish we could take our relationship to the next
  level.
  I know, I feel the same way, but we made a decision to be abstinent.
  Of course, there are ways we could keep our pledge
  and still do other things.
  You're right. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
  Uh-huh.
  Oh, there it is. I see it.
  You know, Roy, I hope you play squash better than you pass.
  Well, we'll find out this Saturday.
  All right, Peter, you ready for role-playing night?
  Here comes, Grimace. You got some burgers I can steal, huh?
  Lois, the Hamburglar steals hamburgers.
  Grimace is Ronald McDonald's autistic friend.
  Oh, come on, you love the dirty-talking Grimace.
  You... Peter, what the hell is this?
  - My chastity belt. - A chastity belt?
  - What in God's name is that for? - I'm abstinent, Lois.
  It's all in these pamphlets Meg brought home from school.
  Sex turns straight people gay and turn gays into Mexicans.
  Everyone goes down a notch.
  This is nonsense. You can't force abstinence on kids.
  Lois, what possible harm can abstinence do?
  Meg Griffin, we need to have a talk.
  Mom!
  Oh, my God!
  You kids were doing it...
  in the ear!
  Hey, my sandwich tastes funny. Is there something wrong with the
  Smucker's?
  Yeah, it's been on my crotch.
  Meg, I still cannot believe what you and Doug did last night.
  Mom, you don't understand. Doug and I are abstinent,
  but if we have sex in the ear, it doesn't count.
  We're still pure in the eyes of the Lord.
  Meg, when I was your age, my parents tried to feed me
  the same nonsense about premarital sex. You're lying to yourself.
  Well, I don't care what you think!
  Doug and I are part of the Opal Ring Crusade,
  and this is how we choose to express our love.
  Look, Meg, A) ear sex is just unnatural,
  and B)... How do I say this?
  Vaginal intercourse is...
  it's just tops.
  It's the bee's knees, Meg.
  Oh, when you rattle it around just right...
  oh, my God!
  I mean, you remember when we had that old car with the bad shocks
  and I used to take the old dirt road on purpose?
  Meg... Meg?
  I love you.
  In local news, a sexy new trend has emerged at James Woods High.
  That's right, Tom. It appears that students have taken to having ear sex
  in lieu of traditional intercourse.
  Over 200 reports of ear sex have been confirmed so far,
  prompting a new slogan : "Once you go black,"
"you go deaf."
Brian, I'll be right back. I'm going to use the little girl's room.
All right, baby.
An entire week and still no teeth.
And it turns out these teeth I got from the old man are phony.
Brian, Brian, look, I'm Gary Busey.
I'm frequently aggressive in situations that don't call for it.
- What the hell is that? - Ah, it's Jillian. She's, uh...
she has this eating disorder. She's bulimic.
- My God, that's horrible! - I know, it really is.
I mean, her hair is falling out. Last week she lost a tooth.
Really?
But man, I'll tell ya, all that purging just makes her body look
  fantastic.
  I mean, that's what the supermodels do.
  And so many of them just look so great.
  Karen Carpenter over did it,
  but I think Jillian's found a good balance.
  I'm really surprised you invited me out for dinner, Stevie.
  Oh, well, you know, I just wanted to touch base, see how everything's...
  It's "Stewie," by the way.
  Just to check in, make sure everything's going well with you and Brian.
  It's going kickass!
  Well, you look fantastic.
  Got some meat on your bones, which is great.
  - What? - Just saying you look jolly,
  like Ruben Studdard or John Goodman or Santa.
  Oh, my God. Are you saying I'm fat?
  No, I'm saying Santa's thin. Get in there and throw up!
  Excellent. Now I'm prepared to fight the Tooth Fairy
  just like Gerri fought comedy on The Facts of Life.
  Hey, Blair, did you find a purse at the mall?
  Actually, I found seven.
  One for every day of the week.
  I'm wide awake, Peter.
  - You want to mess around? - Lois, you know I'm abstinent.
  Come on. Can't you break your stupid pledge for one night?
  Well, I guess we do both have needs.
  Peter.
  Wh-What are you doing? What? Peter, what are you doing to my ear?!
  Get off of me!
  What the hell is wrong with you?!
  This is all I can do, Lois. I'm abstinent.
  That is it.
  I am going to have regular sex with you whether you like it or not.
  No!
  I wasn't asking your permission.
  No, no, no! I'm abstinent!
  This is an affront to the Lord!
  No!
  No!
  No!
  Oh, I see what you're driving at.
  Oh, that was fantastic.
  Hey, when'd you get that tattoo on your lower back?
  I don't know, Peter. Meth is a hell of a drug.
  What?
  I'm just glad to have you back on my side.
  I only wish I could convince Meg and her classmates, too.
  We'll show 'em somehow, Lois.
  I'll be more convincing than Mel Gibson when he apologized to the Jews.
  I'm really, really sorry about your big noses.
  I'm really sorry about how greedy you are.
  But most of all, I'm really sorry about your dirty,
  underhanded, backstabbing ways.
  Your number-one dirty Jew fan, Mel Gibson.
  All right, Tooth Whore, do your worst.
  Stewie, what the hell? Get me down from here.
  No, way, man! How do I know you're not the Tooth Fairy in disguise?
  - Your middle name is Gilligan. - Not good enough!
  - You think my girlfriend's a moron. - So does everyone!
  You have a picture of Chris Noth in your wallet.
  Okay.
  Stewie, this is ridiculous. There's something I have to tell you.
  The Tooth Fairy isn't real.
  What?!
  Look, I didn't want to burst your bubble since you're just a kid, but,
  yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors
  just like Harry Houdini.
  But I don't want to play bridge with the Petersons tonight.
  Harry, we agreed weeks ago, and we're going.
  All right, fine, let me get my coat.
  Oh, wait a second!
  Damn it! I am not going by myself!
  Ah, you bitch.
  Oh, very well then.
  I suppose that bile-spewing skirt of yours can have her tooth back.
  What? It's gone!
  Whoa, I wonder what happened to it?
  Peter, how are we going to get past the guard?
  Lois, I think I just got an idea.
  You see that guy with the overcoat?
  He's tall enough for us to sneakin behind him. Come on!
  So remember, sex is bad, immoral, and wrong.
  And if you have sex, you're automatically in Al Qaeda.
  Kids, do not listen to this man.
  He is wrong, he is feeding you lies.
  Now, look, it's true. You shouldn't have sex until you're ready.
  You should wait until you're in love.
  But I mean, hey, we're all human, huh?
  We have urges, and they are perfectly natural.
  And if you do make the choice to act on them,
  make sure you protect yourselves,
  use a condom.
  - I'm going to use condoms. - Me, too!
  Maybe I'll use two condoms at the same time.
  - Why would you do that? - Oh, I mean, just one, just one.
  Doug, my mom's right.
  If we really care about each other, it's okay to have sex.
  We'll be safe. We'll use a condom,
  and it'll be wonderful.
  Wow! Does this mean I'll see you naked?
  - Yeah. - Oh, boy, I can't wait.
  - I'm sorry Doug dumped you, honey. - It's all your fault!
  - I'm proud of you, sweetheart. - Me, too, Lois.
  You stood up for what you believe in.
  I just wish I could have been there to hear the speech you made.
  You think you could give me a little taste?

Title: Chick Cancer

Coming up, a New Orleans man says his socks are finally dry.
  But first, the big news in entertainment this week
  is the lovable child actress, Olivia Fuller.
  Oh, my God, Brian, that's Olivia from the performing arts school.
  What sort of overblown contract has that dreadful bitch landed now?
  Most of you know Olivia as the adorable little girl in the Tasty Juice
  ads.
  Hey, Mom, can I have some soda?
  No, but you can have some Tasty Juice. It has only one-third the sugar
  of soda.
  Delicious. Thanks, Mom.
  But little Olivia's career may be over just as it begins
  with today's announcement that Tasty Juice
  will be dropping her as their spokesperson
  and replacing her with a new ad campaign
  featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry.
  Open your mouth, baby. Here it comes.
  But there is a silver lining for local Quahogians,
  as Miss Fuller will be appearing at the Quahog mall this weekend
  to mark the grand opening of the new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store.
  Oh, that's perfect.
  Brian, we have to go down there this weekend and heckle her roundly.
  I'll humiliate her worse than Luke Skywalker did to that Rebel pilot.
  The exhaust shaft is only two meters wide,
  so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
  That's impossible. Even for a computer.
  It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye wamprats in my T-16 back home.
  They're not much bigger than two meters.
  Hey, uh, can-can I talk to you privately for a second?
  Sure.
  Th-that, that, uh, that was, that was unnecessary.
  What's the problem?
  Well, you just kind of called me out in front of everybody back there...
  - I was just making a point. - I know, I know, but you like just...
  - kind of sandbagged me. - I sandbagged you?
  In front of all of our friends, yeah,
  - you sandbagged me. - I sandbagged you.
  You sandbagged me, yes.
  Well, here I am trying to help you with something...
  You know what, I don't need your kind of help, all right?
  Have a great assault. Jerk.
  Lois, I don't understand why I got to sit through a chick flick.
  Peter, you promised you'd come with me to see Autumn's Piano.
  Besides, you owe me big after the way you embarrassed me in front of
  Sandra Oh.
  Oh, my God, Sandra Oh. We loved you in Sideways.
  Thank you.
  We see you in many movies.
  I think about you while having sex with my wife.
  I thank you with one dollar. That's a lot of money to them.
  Lois, I'm just warning you,
  if this movie turns me gay, I'm going to start bringing gay guys home.
  And I don't mean the classy "maybe they are, maybe they're not" gay
  guys.
  I mean those big, "Oh, my God,"
"here they come, floatin' around, making noise" gay guys,
not the "fix up your house" gay guys.
Peter, shh, it's starting.
- You must be Autumn Daniels. - Welcome to Barncliffe school for girls.
We're your roommates : I'm Sassy, that's Pouty, and this is Suicidy.
I got a bad feeling about Suicidy.
Ain't no mountain high enough.
Yeah! You can tell all the girls care about each other,
'cause they have so much fun cleaning the dishes.
I have to leave, and I'm taking my piano with me.
No...! Why?
Why? She chose the piano over her insulin.
You could've had both.
See? That wasn't so bad.
Oh, you know, Lois, this movie has helped me understand a lot of things.
Like that foreign guy at work who helped me understand sarcasm.
- Huh, nice day we're having. - Oh, ho-ho! Yes!
- What? - He say "Nice day,"
- but he covered with rain. - So?
So, he say this when your brain know is not really nice day.
Oh, yeah!
Yes. He say the opposite. He's funny.
Oh, yeah, I get it. "Nice day."
Now you funny, too. Oh...
There she is, Brian.
Oh, boy, I am going to take her down right in front of everybody.
All right, Olivia, get ready to...
- Good Lord. - What is it?
Brian, she looks... she looks fantastic.
And now TV's Olivia Fuller will cut the ceremonial ribbon.
I hope I'm allowed to do this. My mommy says, "Don't run with scissors."
She's so cute. I love children. Look at my kids.
So everyone feel free to browse and purchase from our fine selection.
Hey, Mom, now would be a good time to raise my allowance.
Oh, this one's kind of nice. Wha...?
Olivia! Hey...!
Stewie? Oh, my God. Wow, this is... it's been a while.
Yeah, no, it has. Uh, what, so you back in town?
Yeah, we're, um, we're moving back into the old house.
Oh, that's... God, you look great, I mean, you're all, you're all in
  shape.
  My God, California's been good to you.
  I mean, I guess, I guess you should be looking good
  'cause everybody's a health nut out there, right?
  Yeah.
  Well, anyway, it was nice seeing you again, so...
  Hey, listen, maybe you want to come over on Friday, it's my "Bernie
  Mac" night.
  Um, i-it's a fun show if you haven't seen it.
  I can't understand what the devil he's saying, but you know,
  there's a lot of movement, and it's bright and colorful, it keeps my
  attention.
  Look, Stewie, you're sweet,
  but since I moved to Hollywood, I've done a lot of growing up.
  I'm dating more sophisticated men now. But it was good to see you.
  - What happened? - She shot me down, Brian.
  What do you care? You came here to gloat about her contract
  cancellation anyway.
  Yes, but that was before I got a look at her face. I mean,
  she's a woman now, Brian. So sophisticated, so grown up,
  and she says she wants a grown-up man. But...
  - apparently, that's not me. - Ya think so?
  Who could forget that one?
  Hi, I'm the Mayor of Comedy here to tell you about a new CD offer :
  Sitcom Punch Lines of the '80s. Including such gems as :
  and...
  Also...
  Plus...
  And...
  Order now and receive Sounds of the '80s Studio Audience,
  which includes...
  As well as...
  And of course...
  This is an offer you don't want to miss.
  But don't take my word for it.
  Hear what '80s mainstay Howard Hesseman has to say about it.
  I love it.
  Would Howard Hesseman lie for weed? We don't think so. Order now.
  There we go. You are ready for your date.
  Yeah, that's a bed head.
  Yeah, hey, look at you, you just got out of bed.
  You're the underachiever every woman wants to sleep with.
  - Hey, big date tonight? - Uh, yeah, yeah.
  Hey, listen, I'm, uh, sorry about Olivia rejecting you.
  Oh, I haven't given up yet, Brian.
  She says she wants a more mature, grown-up man,
  so all I've got to do is be more grown-up.
  - What are you doing? - Just cleanin' out your brush, man.
  Hi, Jillian.
  Hi, Brian, ready to go?
  - Hey, baby. - Hi, Stewie.
  What the hell are you doing?
  Eh, not much, really. Just me and my pubes,
  ha...ngin' out.
  Oh, dear God.
  Boy, I am so beat from doing adult stuff all day.
  So am I.
  I, just kind of feel like kickin' it tonight.
  Oh, look at that. I'm growing all the time.
  Hey, uh, Jillian, can you give me a minute?
  You ever just let your balls hang out, B-Ri?
  You ever do that, B-Roney?
  Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was Bri?
  - Give me my hair back. - Ow! What the hell, man.
  Stewie, this is not going to convince Olivia
  that you're grown-up enough for her.
  - Yeah, what do you know about women? - You want to know how to get
  women?
  There's only one place in town you need to observe.
  Just watch.
  I am not doing that, Glenn.
  Come on, beautiful, keep an open mind.
  - You're a sick man. - Hey, keep it down.
  I don't want my neighbors seeing a fat, old, dirty whore
  screaming at me on my front lawn.
  Whore?
  - Well, maybe I should come inside. - Well, maybe you should.
  What the deuce?
  Why the hell would she respond positively to such a negative comment?
  Unless...
  Brian, do women like it when you treat them like crap?
  Well, I don't know if you want to be that black and white about it.
  That's it, isn't it? Women respond when you treat them like crap.
  Well, Olivia, prepare to meet a much darker Stewie Griffin.
  Hey, babe. What do you say, we going out Saturday night?
  Stewie, what are you doing here?
  I told you, I'm just into a different type of guy.
  Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what you're into. Being ugly.
  Stewie, you're being mean.
  No. If I was being mean, when you opened the door I would have said,
"Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home? Oh, wait, you're Olivia."
You see, I thought you were Ray Liotta because your skin
has the texture of a decorative autumn squash.
So, I'll pick you up at 7:00?
That sounds wonderful.
She said yes.
My God, I'm cooler than that cheetah from the commercials.
Oh, God, there is no (bleeping) drummer better than Neil Peart!
It ain't easy bein' cheesy.
Oh, Smilla, your sense of snow is equaled only by your sense of love.
Peter, have you been up all night watching chick movies?
Lois, before I found these movies, women only made me cry through my
  penis.
  Now they make me cry through my eyes.
  I've decided. I'm making my own chick flick.
  What? You don't know anything about making movies.
  Are you kidding? I got lots of experience in the film industry.
  I was the original "Pretty Woman."
  You look beautiful, but there's something missing.
  This is a beautiful spot, Stewie.
  I know. I love coming here because you can just sit here and
  people-watch,
  you know?
  Oh, oh, look at this. Look at this guy.
  Look at this. What is that? What is he doing?
  Just standing there smelling his hand?
"What is that? What is that on my hand?"
"Is that... is that barbecue sauce? When was I near barbecue sauce?"
Oh, look, look! Jewish cowboy! Jewish cowboy!
Yeah. Not gonna be so tough when the sun goes down, are you?
Better go rassle up some Chinese food, Hopalong Nussbaum.
You know, Stewie, I'm really glad I gave you another chance.
You're a really special guy.
I know.
No, no, I'm kidding. I'm not really that self-centered, but, you know,
  Olivia,
  I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be than right here right now with
  you.
  Oh, look at this guy. Now, there's someone who cuts his own hair.
  Yeah, no kidding. Oh, my God.
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, check out this uptight Asian guy, look at that.
  I work really hard, 'cause I'm no fun.
  Boy, this is a great city. I don't care what anybody says.
  I know. Look at that sunset against the skyline.
  - I know. Wow, look at that. - A perfect end to a perfect day.
  Yeah. Well, we should probably get home. This area gets really
  dangerous at night.
  Okay, everyone, welcome to the first day of shooting for Steel Vaginas.
  Peter, this movie doesn't seem to make any sense.
  It makes perfect sense, Lois. This the scene where our heroine, Vageena
  Hertz,
  is told by Dr. McNugget here that she has uncurable chick cancer.
  All right, Joe, let's lose the wheelchair and shoot this thing.
  Peter, I can't lose the wheelchair. I need it to move.
  Okay, yeah, but your character can walk.
  Peter, I'm handicapped. I can't walk.
  Okay, Chris, roll film.
  And... action!
  Joe, get out of the damn chair. Chris, get the cattle prod.
  Okay, now give him some peanut butter so we can make it look like he's
  talking.
  God, I hate these things.
  Sweetie, can't you just have a good time?
  I don't know anybody. These are all your friends.
  Just relax. Have some cake or something.
  Hey, hey, who do we have here?
  - Oh, my God! Victor? - Hey, kiddo, how are you?
  Great! Great! Wow!
  Stewie, this is Victor. We did a Flintstones vitamins commercial
  together.
  Ten million strong and growing!
  Oh, yeah, good to meet you. How are you?
  Victor's such a good actor. He played a dead baby on CSI: Miami.
  Yeah, I'm more into writing now.
  Oh, hang on a sec. Uh, idea for a short story :
  guy picks his nose, then eats it.
  Yeah, good luck with that. Hey, Olivia, why don't you and I go get some
  punch?
  Oh, actually, would you mind getting some for Victor and me while we
  catch up?
  Or-or a third option.
  Why doesn't Victor go get some punch for you and me?
  Or maybe you and I could go away from Victor and go get the punch?
  Or-or none of us could have punch. But still Victor could go away.
  Victor, would you excuse us for a second?
  Uh, sure. Idea for a novel :
  guy loses his favorite blankie, goes looking for it and finds it in the
  kitchen.
  Is that... I amaze myself. Is that... It's genius.
  It's unbelievable. I don't know where I get it from.
  What the hell is wrong with you? You're acting like a jerk.
  Oh, I'm acting like a jerk? What about Phony Curtis over there?
  He happens to be a very intelligent, successful actor.
  And, you know, he's done three national diaper commercials.
  Yeah, let's put a diaper on his face. That's where the crap is coming
  out.
  You don't own me. I can talk to whoever I want.
  I don't see a ring on my finger.
  I, Stewie, take you, Olivia, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
  Uh, what's that, Rupert? Oh, oh, kiss the bride. Yes.
  - Hi, honey! I'm home! - Hi, sweetie, how was your day?
  Well, I was an astronaut for a while, then I was a cowboy,
  and then all afternoon I was a fireman, so it's been, uh... it's been a
  long one.
  - Uh, what's for dinner? - Playdoh spaghetti.
  - Oh. - What?
  No. No, it's nothing. Just had Playdoh spaghetti last night.
  - And that's all we had last night. - What does that mean?
  Oh, I don't know, Olivia. Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage.
  We have yet to have sex.
  Do you even know what sex is?
  That's not the poi... Don't change the... It's a kind of cake?
  Look, can we just drop this and have a normal pretend dinner?
  Fine, fine!
  Uch, some days I think it was easier being Q-Bert's roommate.
  God, it's all night with this guy.
  If you're gonna leave all those lights on, I'm not gonna split the
  electric bill.
  Sorry we're late, everyone, but JonBenet here took forever with her
  makeup.
  Uh, yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip,
  but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel,
  so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot.
  But to his credit, it is a great spot to get mugged.
  Wouldn't that be a shame, if they took all my money out of both our
  wallets.
  Well, it's just good to have you guys here.
  Can I get you folks something to drink?
  - Uh, yes, I'll just have flat water. - Um, do you have Hi-C Tropical
  Punch?
  And it begins...
  What? I can't have a drink with dinner?
  So dinner started at 2:00 this afternoon, did it?
  Yes, about the same time you decided to hole up in the bathroom
  - for three hours waxing your eyebrows. - You swore you would never...
  I have a prominent brow, and I do what I can to get by.
  Well, hey, what's important is that you're here now.
  - Let's just enjoy dinner. - Yeah, can't we just have a good time?
  Ask Olivia.
  Olivia, the three of us are having a great time. What's your problem?
  My problem is you. You're acting like a baby.
  And we come to the center of the shrubbery maze.
  That's what it all comes down to, isn't it? I'm not grown up enough for
  you.
  - Well, you are a baby, aren't you? - Stay out of it. Stay out of it.
  Well, if you think I'm a baby, then perhaps I should act like a baby.
  Hey, could you keep that kid quiet?
  Oh, oh, oh, what's that?
  What's that, sir? What's that? I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you?
  You wanna come over here and quiet me down?
  - Oh, let's do this. - Oh, God. Stewie, come on.
  - I'm scared. - No, it's okay. It's okay.
  Sir? You feel strong? You wanna come over here?
  No, I want to stay here and have my steak.
  - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
  - What is that, the porterhouse? - Yeah.
  - How is it? - What do you care?
  If we weren't fighting, would you recommend it?
  Yeah, I would.
  Well, I know what I'm getting.
  Hello, everyone. Well, here we are... opening night.
  You know, somebody once told me that making movies was easy.
  Yeah. Yeah, you know what else is easy? Open heart surgery.
  - Oh-ho-ho! Yes! - Yeah, thanks for coming, Fuad.
  Oh! Is funny because open heart surgery not easy at all.
  Yeah, yeah. Calm down, Fuad.
  So, without further dudes, ah, let's, uh, watch this thing.
  At first I didn't believe in women and unicorns,
  but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff,
  and before I knew Vageena Hertz.
  Sorry.
  When Vageena was first born, I had a small heart and a lot to
  learn.
  Push, honey! Hurry up and give me my baby boy!
  Cleveland, more SpaghettiO's.
  Oh, good, a baby. Oh, no, it's a girl.
  And I hate girls.
  But one day, Vageena went swimming too soon after eating a
  sandwich...
  and this happened.
  Help! Help! I'm drowning!
  Help!
  We gotta get this woman to surgery time. Right stat now!
  But it was too late. And she died from an angry hymen.
  Fin.
  Wow, that was the worst piece of crap I ever seen.
  Oh, my God, that was an abomination.
  - That was awful. Awful. Awful, awful. - My ass is actually sore.
  My ass is actually sore.
  - Hey, where's Olivia? - Oh, she's probably up at the house.
  - Stewie? - Yeah?
  - It's not your fault. - What?
  - It's not your fault. - I know.
  - It's not your fault. - I know.
  No, Stewie, Stewie. It's not your fault.
  Don't do this to me, man. Not you, man.
  - It's not your fault. - Screw you! Cut it out, man.
  - It's not your fault. - Why is it so hard?
  I didn't know it was gonna be so hard.
  Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys
  and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough.
  You want her to see you as an adult? Well, this is adulthood.
  You're right, Brian. I can't hide from this relationship.
  It's my responsability to deal with it.
  I mean, what kind of a man would I be If I ran off now?
  Well, you'd be a black man.
  - Whoa, what was that? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
  That was my father talking.
  You, uh...
  you gotta work on that, man.
  Bad dog.
  Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I...
  Oh, Stewie! I thought you were at Chuck E. Cheese's with your mom.
  No. A four-year-old died in the ball pit. We had to cancel.
  Is that the Silly Putty I bought you this weekend?
  Stewie, this isn't what it looks like.
  Uh-uh, yeah, Stewie, I just dropped by to...
  Uh, uh, uh, ain't nobody talking to you.
  Is... that... the Silly Putty...
  I bought you...
  this weekend?
  You know, I'm really sensing something here...
  I should be go.
  No, about you stay here and I leave and never come back again?
  Stewie, this isn't how I wanted it to end.
  But you did want it to end. You've made that perfectly clear.
  - Listen, are you gonna be all right? - Yeah, I'll be fine.
  Is that smoke?
  Idea for a farce : cheating wife and pompous ass burned alive.
  So what happened?
  Well, you wanna know what I learned this week? Being a grown-up sucks.
  Women, Brian. What a royal pain in the ass. It's like, it's like,
  why can't you just hang out with guys, you know?
  Just live with someone of your own sex. Just do what you would do with
  women,
  but with your buddy, you know, why don't guys just do that?
  They do, it's called being gay.
  Oh, that's what gay is? Yeah, I could totally get into that.



Title: Road to Rupert

Oh, Peter, you're selling your anvil?
  Yeah, I've had a lot of good times with this thing.
  Ooh! A dollar!
  - Hey there, Chris. - Hi, Mr. Herbert.
  - Selling your old hand-me-downs? - Yep.
  You got anything you used to wear in the summertime?
  - Just these old shorts. - Sweet Jesus.
  - Give you a dollar for this. - Sold.
  Brian, where's Rupert? I just left him here to watch my things.
  - What? - Uh, nothing, I haven't seen him.
  It's not like him to wander off. Rupert? Rupert!
  Oh, no. What if he's been kidnapped?
  - Well, let's just calm down... - I've got to save him, Brian.
  What if he's dead? I don't think I can handle a funeral.
  Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels,
  his was the most...
  human.
  Orders... hup!
  Holy crap. Evel Knievel gloves!
  I bet I could do a wheelie with these! How much for the gloves?
  - Peter, those are yours. - Ten bucks.
  Two. Seven. Four. $5.50. Ten. Sold!
  Sucker. I would've gone to $15, easy. I am so stupid.
  Awesome!
  Peter, you can't drive the car over that. You're gonna get hurt.
  Lois, I don't come down to Burger King and tell you how to do your job.
  - Peter, I don't work at Burger... - I don't work at burgaga... I'm
  busy.
  Now if you'll excuse me, I have some death to defy.
  This is just like what happened with Matthew Broderick, except no one's
  dead.
  - Hey, Joe. - Good morning, Peter.
  - I'm here to revoke your driver's license. - What?! Why?!
  We got reckless driving, disturbing the peace,
  plus the driver of one of the other cars was a virgin
  whose hymen was busted by the airbag, so rape.
  Okay, well, I guess you can take my license.
  'Course it's all the way up here.
  Peter, knock if off. Give it to me.
  Give me the damn license.
  This is in poor taste, Peter. You're starting to piss me off.
  You're starting to piss me off!
  Aw, man, this sucks. I got no license. I can't go anywhere.
  Well, this is your own fault, Peter, and if you want my opinion,
  a little time away from the bar will do you some good.
  I'll show her. I'll just go to another bar.
  We now return to Cheers.
  - Norm! - And Peter! Yeah!
  How's life in the fast lane, Mr. Peterson?
  - Griffin. - I can't find the on-ramp, Woody.
  He was talking to me, Norm.
  Quit stealing my punch lines, you fat drunk.
  That show stopped being funny after Kirstie Alley ate Shelley Long.
  Ah, man, now I can't even watch TV. What the hell am I gonna do all day?
  That's all right, that's okay. I don't need TV.
  I'll just make my own sitcom in my head.
  And I'll give it an upbeat '80s sitcom theme.
  This time around, I'm staying at home.
  And things are gonna get better.
  Settlin' in, lovin' my wife.
  But then I got that letter.
  My Black Son, My Black Son.
  Now each day my heart is getting bigger.
  Don't even remember sleeping with that lady, but I did.
  My Black Son. He's coming to stay.
  My Black Son. He's making each day...
  The best that he can.
  Also he's a ninja.
  Why have you brought me to the toy store, Brian?
  I'm buying you another Rupert.
  Hey, this one's cute, huh?
  And if we buy it, they save a real gorilla in the wild.
  And if we don't, they kill one. Wow, these guys are playing hardball.
  You can't just take some Korean-made velveteen primate and call it
  Rupert.
  Now come on, this is all time we could be using to find Rupert's
  kidnappers.
  Look, I, uh... I may as well come clean with you.
  Rupert wasn't kidnapped.
  I accidentally sold him at the yard sale.
  You son of a bitch!
  Come on, Stewie, I'm really sorry. It was an accident.
  Damn you, Brian. How could you sell Rupert?
  What you've done is more horrible than sex with Sharon Stone.
  Wow, that was great!
  One minute I'm filling up at Chevron,
  and the next I'm having sex with Sharon Stone.
  Yeah. Now comes the best part.
  - Get out of the fridge, Peter. - There is no Peter, only Zuul.
  I said get out of the fridge!
  All right, all right! Geez, Lois, I'm just trying to amuse myself,
  since I don't have a damn driver's license.
  Peter, it's getting a little annoying having you around the house all
  the time.
  So you'll be happy to know I got you your own personal driver.
  My own driver?! Holy crap, that's awesome! Where is he?
  - She's right here, Peter. - Meg?!
  Yeah, Dad. I don't mind driving you around till you get your license
  back.
  What?! Lois, this is the best you could do?!
  Well, it was either Meg or a talking monkey smoking a cigar,
  but I didn't you'd like that.
  I've already accepted another job.
  Lois, you picked the opposite thing that I would like.
  It's all right. I would've driven you bananas.
  Oh, oh, and he makes jokes. Nice going, Lois.
  Dad, are you ready?
  - What exactly are you trying to do? - It's very simple, Brian.
  I've taken DNA from the dollar bill you were paid for Rupert.
  Now to check that DNA against the federal database.
  Ooh, we have a match!
  Stanford Cordray, 89 Spooner Street.
  That's only a few blocks away. Let's go!
  Hello? Hello?
  It can't be. This house is deserted.
  He moved. He's gone. Rupert's gone.
  Wait a minute, look! The moving truck.
  We're not too late.
  - Can I help you, gentlemen? - Follow that truck.
  Didn't you hear me? I said, "Follow that truck."
  Oh, I heard you. What I didn't hear was, "Please."
  Please follow the truck.
  I always enjoy traveling companions. Let's play 20 questions.
  Am I Bo Bice? Yes, I am.
  Well played, worthy adversary.
  We're gaining on him! I'm coming, Rupert!
  - I'm sorry, but I can go no further. - What?! Why not?!
  If I enter Connecticut, I'm entering every state
  that Connecticut's ever been with.
  Good luck, brave travelers.
  No! We were so close!
  I say, what a bit of serendipity. Now we've got that fellow's address.
  Let's see... "Aspen, Colorado."
  Well, you can forget that. We're not going all the way to Aspen.
  What?! But I can't leave Rupert to perish.
  For the rest of my life, I'll be as lonely
  as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell after the rapture.
  Damn it, Jerry, why are we the only ones still here?
  I don't know, we hated all the right things.
  - Now there's nothing left to hate. - I'm gonna hate that rock.
  - No, I'm gonna hate that rock. - Let's both hate that rock.
  - I hate you. - I hate you, too.
  Look, Stewie, don't you think, at some point,
  you're gonna have to let Rupert go?
  I mean, you are getting a little old to have a teddy bear.
  - Brian, I'm one! - Still? What?
  Look, I'm not going to Colorado. I'm turning around and going home.
  Fine, then, I'll go by myself. See you from the back of my milk carton.
  Want that on your conscience, Brian? Try explaining this to Lois.
  You'll wind up in a Dumpster with a bunch of slow, unadoptable
  greyhounds.
  Don't joke about that. That's like the Holocaust to us.
  Yeah, well, when greyhounds start running The New York Times
  and the World Bank, I'll be more inclined to believe you.
  Now, are you coming or not?
  Fine.
  Take to the highway Won't you lend me your name...
  - Who sings that song? - James Taylor.
  Yeah, let's keep it that way.
  This sucks. Can you believe I'm stuck with Meg driving me around?
  Dad, it's just you and me in the car.
  Don't remind me.
  It's bad enough I got a suspended license,
  I gotta ride around town with Stinky McPoop-Pants.
  - I want apple juice. - Dad, you left your apple juice at home.
  I want apple juice!
  - You want to watch SpongeBob? - Yes.
  With apple juice.
  SpongeBob.
  Thanks for the ride, Bandit. Good luck tapping some of that
  hot, hot Sally Field tail.
  Knock it off. I don't like it any more than you do.
  Where the hell are we?
  Oh, this is history right here, Brian.
  Gettysburg. Billy Yanks. The 20th Maine.
  So many lives lost.
  All in pursuit of the ideal that no man
  should be subjugated because of the color of his skin.
  These boys paid the ultimate price here.
  For equality. For humanity.
  - You're welcome. - I'm sorry?
  I'm just sayin', make it worth our while, you know?
  We wrote a pretty big check for you folks here, so, um...
  You know, whatever. It's fine. It's fine. Doesn't matter. Just, uh...
  I...
  Just hope you're making the best of what we gave you here.
  I would say that, given the events that preceded it,
  the couple hundred years or so, maybe we're about even.
  Yeah, no, no. We gave more.
  Hey, Cleveland, who would you rather do :
  Queen Latifah or Halle Berry, but she's been dead for six hours?
  Aw, man. That's a tough one.
  God, will you guys just shut up back there?!
  Aah! Gross! Would you stop it? Stop it!
  Hey, guys, check this out.
  Hey, Meg, don't be such a hothead.
  What?!
  Hey, Meg, you sure look hot today.
  What?!
  Hey, Meg, I lit your scalp on fire.
  Don't worry, I'll put it out.
  What the hell is your problem, you dumb bimbo?!
  Oh, oh, God, stop!
  Meg, that was awesome.
  If we wanna get to Aspen, we're gonna have to get over those mountains
  somehow.
  Excuse me, uh, how much is it to rent a helicopter?
  It's ten bucks an hour. But there's a $100,000 deposit.
  Oh, God. Looks like we're walking.
  Wait a minute, it says here you accept cash, check or a jaunty tune.
  Well, this rental agreement was drafted back
  when musicals were culturally relevant.
  Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.
  Well, I can prove to you that's a whole lot of nonsense.
  You may think that song and dance is dated boring and dry.
<>But you might just learn to like it if you give it a
  try.
  You could laugh and sing and dance as gaily as an elf.
  But just in case you don't believe me, ask the man himself.
  Mr. Kelly? Will you show us?
  - I'll show you. - Let's do it.
  - Good. One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.
  - One, two, three. - One, two, three.
  - La, la, la, la, la, la. - La, la, la, la, la, la.
  - You see? - It's easy.
  Look at me! I'm dancing!
  Okay, you can have the helicopter.
  Brian, be careful 'cause the mountains are the same color as the sky.
  What?
  I said, be careful 'cause the mountains are the same color as the...
  - What the hell was that? - I'm practicing my comedy crash.
  Well, keep it down 'cause I'm trying to...
  Imagine the dance I'm gonna have to do to get our security deposit back.
  Oh, my God! Brian, look!
  It's Aspen. We made it.
  Well, looks like you're gonna be reunited with Rupert after all.
  And just in time, too. I can't keep my teeth from chattering.
  Isn't that fun?
  I got these at Jack's Joke Shop in South Attleboro, Massachusetts.
  Remember, if it ain't funny, it ain't worth Jack.
  Bitch.
  Aw, you should've seen what our amazing, freakin' daughter
  did to that guy, Lois. She kicked his ass.
  - It was like what life did to Dana Plato. - Meg, how could you do
  that?!
  You should call that man and apologize.
  Hey, hey, hey. Don't you talk to her like that.
  Meg's as cool as the other side of the pillow.
  - Billy Dee Williams. - Hello, Peter.
  Welcome to the cool side of the pillow. You've had a hard day.
  Rest that weary head of yours and drift on off to dreamland.
  Works every time.
  Well, this is the place. Looks pretty fancy.
  - Can I help you? - Uh, yes, my name's Brian, um...
  Look, to make a long story short,
  I accidentally sold you a teddy bear back in Rhode Island, and...
  I kind of need it back.
  - Rupert! It's, it's Rupert! - Stanford, who is it?
  It's nothing, dear, I'll handle it.
  I'm sorry, but that bear belongs to Timmy. Now, please leave.
  Wait, wait. How about a ski off?
  - What...? - You heard me.
  First one down the mountain wins. If I win, I get Rupert.
  Interesting. What do I get if I win?
  - My dog. - Hmm. What can he do?
  If you put peanut butter anywhere on your body, he'll lick it off.
  Anywhere.
  Well, I did go to Choate.
  All right, it's a deal.
  She's the kind of girl who's not too shy.
  And I can tell I'm her kind of guy.
  She danced close to me like I hoped she would.
  She danced for me like I hoped she would.
  Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin' good...
  You know, Dad, it's been really great hanging out with you.
  I know there's probably a million things you'd rather be doing.
  Are you kidding, Meg? I've had more fun with you than I did
  going to see Lost in Translation with Cleveland and Quagmire.
  - What do you think he whisper to her? - I'll bet it was just right.
  Look, I know sometimes I give you a hard time.
  You know, calling you names, reading your diary,
  farting in your cereal when you go to get milk
  and then laughing : "Ha-ha ha! She doesn't know she's eating my fart."
  But, you know, Meg, I'm starting to realize
  - I got a really wonderful daughter. - Thanks, Dad.
  Peter, good news. Your suspension is up. You can have your license back.
  You... you mean it? I'm free?
  No more getting driven around? Aw, sweet!
  So, I guess this means you don't need me anymore.
  You'll probably go back to treating me like crap, huh?
  Well, maybe just to keep up appearances in front of the family.
  You know, peer pressure and all that. But from now on, Meg,
  you and me are secret best friends.
  Who wants a glass of fresh lemonade?
  Not me!
  What I want is a fresh glass of better daughter!
  Stewie, do you really think you can beat this guy?
  Trust me, Brian, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
  Oh, no, if only I had rockets in my skis.
  Oh, wait, I totally have rockets in my skis.
  And now I just sit back, relax and watch my progress.
  - Tea, sir? - Oh, thank you, Crone.
  You're so pleasant.
  Would you like to check on the race, sir?
  Yes, why not.
  Well, that's it, I suppose.
  Listen, I'm, I'm really sorry, Stewie.
  - I know how much Rupert meant to you. - I don't know, Brian,
  maybe this is a sign that you were right.
  Maybe I am getting too old for Rupert.
  I guess I've just got to let him go.
  That's very grown up of you, Stewie.
  Hey, dog, let's go. My dad won you fair and square.
  You're not really gonna live with them, are you?
  No.
  You're not really over Rupert are you?
  - No. - That's what I thought.
  Oh, Crone.
  - How are we gonna get out of here? - You still got the starting gun?
  - Yeah. - Give it to me.
  Get out of the fucking car! Get out of the fucking car right now, man!
  - Oh, Jesus! - Get out of the fucking car.
  Do it! I don't give a fuck!
  I'll fucking kill you! Get out of this fucking car!
  - Did we just carjack someone? - We sure did, Brian.
  We sure did.



Title: Peters Two Dads

Um, Mom, Dad, um,
  I decided I want a big party this year with all my friends.
  And maybe a band. Is that cool?
  - Yeah, sure... - Yeah, sure. Why not?
  Oh, thanks, guys! You're the best!
  What's she talking about? A party for what?
  I don't know. She have her period or something? She getting married?
  No. If she was getting married,
  we probably would've seen a guy around, right?
  - Sound reasoning. - You guys,
  it's Meg's birthday next week.
  Oh, my God, it is! Peter, we got to put together a party!
  Ah, man, I hate kids' birthday parties.
  This is gonna be worse than that time I was stuck behind Robert Loggia
  at the airport.
  - May I have your name, please? - Robert Loggia.
  - Can you spell that for me? - Certainly. That's Robert Loggia.
"R" as in Robert Loggia,
"O" as in "Oh, my God, it's Robert Loggia,"
"B" as in "By God, that's Robert Loggia,"
"E" as in everybody loves Robert Loggia,
"R" as in Robert Loggia,
"T" as in "Tim, look over there, it's Robert Loggia,"
space,
"L" as in "Look, it's Robert Loggia..."
- Here you are, Brian. - What's this?
It's an invitation to Meg's party. I'm the party planner.
You have to RSVP. You can do it right now if you want.
All right, fine, I'll come to Meg's party.
No, you have to call the RSVP line.
- You got to be kidding me. - I'm waiting.
Ring, ring.
Aren't you gonna pick it up?
No, I'm not gonna pick it up on the first few rings. I'm busy.
Maybe I'm in the other room.
Ring, ring.
Ring, ring.
Ring, ring.
- Ring... Oh, come on! - Hello!
- Stewie? - No, this is Stewie's housekeeper,
Mrs. Pennyapple. I'll see if he's in.
Stewie! Stewie!
- Yes, Mrs. Pennyapple? - You've got a telephone call.
- Who is it? - He didn't say.
- Well, find out, would you? - Who is this?
- It's Brian. - It's Brian!
Oh, Brian. Probably RSVPing about Megan's party.
- Hello, Brian. - Hi, Stewie.
- What can I do for you? - I'm coming to Meg's party.
Oh, splendid. Just give your information to Mrs. Pennyapple.
Hello, it's Mrs. Pennyapple again. Shall I put you down for two,
  Brendan?
  - Brian. - Ryan?
  - Brian! - Mitchell?
  - What? - Good-bye.
  Hey, Lois, I'm ordering a birthday cake,
  and the guy wants to know how old Meg is. I didn't know what to tell
  him.
  - You're asking me? - Yeah. How old is Meg?
  - I don't know. - Well, my God, Lois,
  I thought you were the one keeping track of that.
  No, no. I have no idea.
  Don't you remember me faking my way through her last birthday?
  You are hmm-hmm. Going on hmm-hmm.
  Fellas will fall in line...
  Should we...
  Should we just ask her how old she is?
  That, uh...
  that'd be kind of awkward, huh?
  Hey, maybe we should just cut off her leg and count the rings.
  Yeah. Or maybe try carbon dating.
  I don't know what that is.
  You know, we're gonna have to talk to her
  and kind of steer the conversation in a way that gets her to spill it.
  Come in.
  - Hi, sweetie. - Hey, Meg.
  So, Meg, your birthday's coming up, huh?
  You excited about turning...
  Uh, Meg,
  I got 16 candles for your birthday cake.
  - How does that sound? - That's not right.
  So... less...?
  More...? Too many...?
  - Not enough? - You stupid son of a bitch!
  You didn't even know how old I am!
  Meg, that kind of language is not appropriate for a girl your age.
  - Or is it? - I'm gonna be 17, you jerks!
  She's the jerk.
  All right, come on in, everybody. Have a seat anywhere.
  Meg's gonna open her presents in a little bit.
  Oh, Francis, I'm glad you could make it.
  Here! This for Megan!
  - Oh. What is it? - It's a cookie
  - from lunch period at the home! - Well, I'm sure she'll love this.
  I want to see her eat it!
  So the man asks the bartender to recommend a good drink.
  The bartender says, "A Grasshopper." So the guy orders a Grasshopper.
  Then he's walking home and along the way,
  he notices a grasshopper on the ground.
  So he says to the grasshopper : "Hey,
  you know there's a drink named after you?"
  The grasshopper says : "You mean there's a drink named Irving?"
  So which one of you wants to lose your virginity?
  Mom, this party sucks!
  I mean, balloons? Pin the tail on the donkey? I'm not five years old.
  Meg, your father worked very hard to put this party together.
  He says he's got a big surprise for you.
  Hey, kids, I'm Peepants, the inebriated hobo clown.
  I'm an adorable tramp who wears found clothing and eats out of your
  garbage can.
  A clown?! Dad, I'm 17!
  Meg, guess what Peepants got you for your birthday.
  - A scarf. - I don't want a scarf, Dad.
  Well, then how about... a dozen scarves?!
  Peter, I don't think you're actually supposed to swallow those.
  - Here you go, Meg. - I don't want them!
  Take them!
  Are my long john stied to the end of those?
  - No. - Oh, God.
  Mom, can I just open my presents now?
  - All right, Meg. - Thank you.
  - What the...? - Let's see what else we've got here.
  The first season of Sister, Sister on DVD?
  You're welcome.
  Stewie, what are you doing?! You can't open Meg's gifts!
  These are mine, you hear me? Mine!
  Oh, God, not the "mine" phase. I've been dreading this day.
  I'm entitled to these things, Lois.
  Especially after I got shafted by that Asian Santa at the mall.
  What you want?! What you want for Christmas?!
  I was thinking maybe one of those old-timey...
  Too late! Take too long! Sad Christmas!
  - What you want?! - Fire truck!
  - What color?! - Red!
  Next!
  Peter, have you been drinking?
  - Well, a little. It is a party. - Take off that stupid costume!
  You look like a damn fool.
  Ah, Dad, you won't say that when you see my grand unicycle finale.
  Everyone, I'll be right back.
  In the meantime, I leave you with the musical stylings of Chris Griffin.
  I don't know what we're afraid of
  Nothing would change if we made love
  So I'll be your friend
  And I'll be your lover...
  All right, this is gonna blow you guys...
  - Grandpa! - Oh, my God!
  - Is he breathing? - Somebody call an ambulance!
  Uh, Lois, maybe you better call two ambulances.
  How is he, Doctor?
  Mrs. Griffin, his internal injuries were much too severe.
  I'd estimate he'll be dead within the hour.
  Dad, I'm so sorry I broke all your ribs
  and busted your spleen and punctured your lung.
  I don't if you can hear me right now, but
  I hope you know...
  I love you, Dad.
  Peter...
  come closer.
  There's something... I need to say to you.
  I'm here, Dad. What is it?
  Peter...
  you're a fat, stinking drunk.
  Oh, my God, he's dead. He can't be dead.
  There's got to be something I can do.
  Maybe I'll bury him in the pet cemetery.
  Okay, I'll bury him in a regular cemetery.
  - I can't believe Grandpa's dead. - Well, he did kind of treat us like
  crap,
  - but, yes, it is a tragedy. - It is a tragedy.
  - Excuse us. - Yeah, we'll be right back.
  - We're all gonna miss him. - Tragic.
  You know what the worst part is?
  All I wanted was for my dad to tell me he loved me.
  But instead, he called me a fat, stinking drunk.
  Those were his last words.
  Well, I hate to side with your father, Peter,
  but you do kind of drink a lot, and,
  you know, sometimes it affects the people you love.
  Oh, my God. Lois, you're right.
  Booze made me fall down all those stairs.
  Booze killed my father.
  Well, from this day forward, I, Peter Griffin,
  will never drink again.
  - Peter, what are you doing? - Crack.
  - What the fuck?! - Hey, at least I'm not drinking, Brian.
  This isn't exactly a good substitute. Where'd you get crack?
  - From blacks. - What?
  Right behind Black's Hardware Store. There's a white guy selling it.
  Doing crack is not the way to stop drinking.
  You need to get to the heart of why you feel the need to drink in the
  first place.
  Look, here, this is the number of a hypnotherapist I want you to see.
  - All right, Brian. - Good.
  Peter, just thought I'd check on you. Oh, my God!
  Gov'ment came and took my baby!
  This is mine, and this is mine, and that's mine, and this is mine.
  Oh, what's this?
"Hot Monogamy, the board game for failing marriages."
"Dare card : Have her do a strip tease
and see how long it takes you to get a bonner."
What's a "bonner"?
Stewie, what are you doing with my jewelry box?
- You give that back to Mommy. - No! Go to hell!
Stewie, I have had just about enough of this new selfish attitude of
  yours.
  - Now, give that back to Mommy! - Very well, then.
  - If I can't have it, nobody can! - That is enough!
  - You... you struck me! - Oh, my God.
  Stewie, honey, I am so sorry. Are you okay, sweetie?
  Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Mommy would never hurt you.
  - Let me give you a hug. - No!
  I haven't been this scared since Mother Teresa OD'd in my car.
  She is messed up, man!
  Shut up! Just shut up! Let me fucking think!
  - Push her out. - We can't leave her alone.
  Push the bitch out!
  Okay, now let's go back in your mind to your childhood,
  - to some of your deepest memories. - Yeah, I'm getting something.
  - Happy Father's Day, Dad. - I'm not your father!
  Oh, my God!
  Francis Griffin wasn't my real father!
  I wonder what else I've repressed.
  Oh, my God!
  I could've had a V8.
  It was horrible, Rupert. It was like a nightmare.
  Lois came at me like a wild animal. I had no way to defend myself.
  Mother, I'm sorry I went against your wishes.
  I'm sorry I misbehaved, mother! I'm sorry I misbehaved!
  I love you, Mommy Dearest!
  Oh, it was awful, Rupert. I felt terrified and
  brutalized and humiliated and... and...
  and alive.
  My God, I... I haven't felt that alive in years.
  Rupert, you know, I think perhaps I may be one of those people who...
  - gets a jolly out of being hit. - Oh, Stewie, there you are.
  Mommy is so sorry she hit you.
  I promise I will never lay a hand on you again.
  Well, let's not make any rash decisions. I mean, I did provoke you.
  Come on, Lois, hit me! Beat the crap out of me! Step on my cubes.
  Oh, hi, Peter. Are you here to bring back the TV set?
  No, I sold it for crack. But listen, Mom, I've got to ask you something.
  Who's my real father?
  I knew this day would come. All right, Peter, here it is.
  About 40 years ago, I was vactioning in Ireland,
  and I met a young rogue named Mickey McFinnegan.
  Peter, Mickey is your real father.
  Oh my God! I gotta find him!
  To Ireland!
  - Sweetheart, when will you be back? - I don't know, Lois.
  All I know is somewhere in the great land of Ireland,
  is a big fat bastard who looks like me.
  Call me as soon as you can, Peter. And I really hope you find your real
  father.
  - We're going to miss you, Dad. - Come back soon, Daddy. I love you.
  That'll do, pig. That'll do.
  There she is, Rupert.
  If I can just get her to hit me one more time,
  it'll give me the rush I've been looking for!
  What's next? What's next? Oh, God, I've been so bloody naughty,
  and I need to be taught a lesson and you're the one to do it.
  Oh! Thank you!
  Thank you!
  Yeah, all that stuff. Let's make that happen.
  - Hi, sweetie. You want some juice? - Ooh, that'll be lovely.
  - Oh, Stewie! - Yeah?
  - Look at the mess you made. - I've made a terrible mess, haven't I?
  Yes, I made you take time out of your day to clean my mess
  - and I should be punished for it. Go! - Well, I guess it's not that
  big a deal.
  - Accidents happen. - I don't know.
  Don't you think you should spank me or slice my nostril?
  - It's all right, Stewie. Now go play. - All right.
  Look! I've drawn heavy weight pugilist David Tua on the wall.
  - Punish me! - Sweetie, you've really gotta stop...
  huh, looks like David Tua...
  You really got to stop misbehaving. You're getting on Mommy's nerves.
  Well, you know what'll ease your stress? Slap me across the face like a
  bitch!
  It's all right. I'll get some windex.
  Come on! Discipline me!
  Make me wear panties, rub dirt in my eye, violating me with a wine
  bottle.
  My God, I really do have problems, don't I?
  Welcome to Ireland. We'll be landing in five minutes.
  This is quite a country, Brian.
  You know, Ireland has more drunks per capita than people.
  That's a negative stereotype.
  I don't think the Irish drink as much as people say they do.
  Uh, excuse me? Is this McSwiggen Village?
  Ah, did ***** who say a word *****, hmm?
  Is that a yes or a no?
  Aye, tis McSwiggen Village. Where the hills are green, the streams are
  clear,
  and the sweaters are so thick,
  even the boniest-fingered nun could poke you in the chest
  and it wouldn't bother you none.
  Don't be so bold with your dark hair and your proud ways!
  I can't feel a thing!
  You heard of a man named Mickey McFinnegan?
  Have I heard of him? Of course I've heard of him!
  - He's the town drunk. - Town drunk?!
  Oh, my God, you mean he's the disgrace of the whole town?
  You lads aren't from around here, are ya?
  Top of the morning, ladies! Let me cut you an Irish rose.
  I don't know exactly where the county Cork is
  but I know where it should be!
  Around here, the town drunk is a person of great honor.
  Excuse me, sir? My name is Peter.
  Pleased to meet you, lad. My name's Mickey.
  Listen, uh, this maybe hard for you to believe but...
  - You're my father. - Oh, am I now?
  Yeah, I came all the way from America to find you.
  I suppose it's money you're wanted. I owe you some allowance and so
  forth.
  Oh, no, I don't want money. I just want to get to know you and be
  friends.
  So I can finally have a real dad who loves and respects me.
  You can't be me son. You and me are nothing alike.
  Just ask me sheep, O'Brian.
  Who's leg do you have to hump to get a pint of Guiness around here?
  Boy it's amazing, isn't it? You get two fathers
  and neither one of them wants anything to do with you.
  There's got to be some way I can make him see that I'm worthy of being
  his son.
  About the only way I can ever impress him is if I was a fat stinkin'
  drunk.
  Peter! You are a fat stinking drunk.
  - What? - You're a fat stinking drunk!
  Yes, from was he told us. That's right on the money.
  - Challenge him, you must. - And I'm Hayden Christensen.
  Wait a minute, Brian, that's it! I'm a fat stinkin' drunk
  because my father is a fat stinkin' drunk. I gotta prove it to him.
  I have gotta drink him so far under the table,
  he'll have no choice but to respect me. Get me a beer, Brian.
  I am going to prepare for this as thoroughly as
  Ben Affleck prepares for a role.
  Wow, I got to be Henry VIII in twenty minutes!
  Allo? Allo? Alloo? Alloo?
  Got it!
  Mickey McFinnegan, I challenge you to a drinking contest.
  And what makes you think you can hold your own with the *likes* of me?
  Because I'm your son. And I'm tough.
  I mean it half way through Failure to Launch.
  I just never managed to get my life together.
  Isn't that hilarious?
  You're cute.
  Done!
  As we say in Ireland,
  Let's drink until the alcohol in our system destroy ours livers and
  kills us.
  - I've got twenty on the fat one. - Which one's the fat one?
  - What happened? - Peter, you won!
  My God, nobody's ever beat me at the game of drink.
  Now do you believe that you're my dad?
  Nobody but a McFinnegan could handle that much of the creature.
  You're the broth of me own stubby shillelagh, all right.
  - Welcome to me family, Peter. - You hear that, Brian?
  I'm a McFinnegan now! I can forget all about Francis.
  You know, there's something you should always remember, Peter.
  Francis may not have been your father,
  but he raised you as if you were his own. And if that isn't love,
  - I don't know what is. - Wow, I guess you're right.
  But there is one thing, Mickey.
  You knocked up my mom and never called her again.
  - Yeah, so what? - So what?
  So let's dance!
  He doesn't smell like Irish Spring And he never taught me
  anything
  But still I slap my chest and sing of my drunken Irish dad
  His face looks like a railroad map And he never shuts his
  freakin' trap
  But all the ladies catch the clap from your drunken Irish dad
  Ask a Hennesy, Tennesy, Morrison,
  Shaughnessy, Riordan and Rooney, they'll tell you the same
  McNutley, Mulrooney and Cotter and Clooney
  All feel the same mixture of pride and the shame
  Finnegan, Hannigan, Kelly and Flannigan
  Look to the ground when their dad passes by
  Cafferty, Rafferty, Joyce and O'Lafferty
  Fight for his honor and then start to cry...
  We Irish lads are all infirm And our moods infect us like a
  germ
  'Cause we're all the spawn of a pickled sperm...
  And we don't tan well, either.
  From our drunken Irish dad!



Title: The Tan Aquatic With Steve Zissou

Peter, are you sure you're allowed to bring a baby onto the golf course?
  Well, Lois asked me to watch Stewie for the afternoon.
  It's all right, I don't think the club will mind.
  - It's Cleveland I'm worried about. - Peter, is this really necessary?
  - I can't hardly see anything. - Hey, look, it's President Nixon.
  No, wait, it's a black guy. No, it's Nixon.
  Oh, boy, that was close.
  Will you please hurry up? It's 100 degrees out here.
  You're a worse parent than Britney Spears.
  I know, I know.
  Oh, the gift basket was not worth the trip, not by a long shot.
  Oh, I got to get that. I'll talk to you later.
  - Hey, uh, Joe... - Don't say it, Peter.
  - I was just wondering... - Peter, I swear to God...
  What's your handicap?
  Every hole... that's a joke that just doesn't get old!
  Damn it! Come on! Come on!
  Come on, Glen! Come on, get your head in the damn game!
  Hey, do you think it's time to talk to Quagmire
  about his anger issues with this game?
  A white man shouldn't play sports in the first place.
  Hey, hey, that's a stroke!
  I just tapped my ball, Quagmire. Relax.
  Oh, relax? Oh, okay.
  Look, I just tapped my ball.
  Just tapped it again.
  Tap, tap, tap.
  Where is it? Oh! It's in the hole.
  Eagle. Yay, Quagmire.
  Hey, Quagmire, you know it's not fun when you're like this.
  You want fun? Go home and buy a monkey.
  - What does that even mean? - I don't know.
  Boy, we've got a beautiful day for this.
  Hi, Mr. Herbert. Here's your paper.
  Sorry, Chris, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to cancel my
  subscription.
  Cancel? But you love this paper.
  Listen, I think you're a real nice guy,
  but I've just decided to go with another paper.
  Hello, there, Kyle. You look nice today.
  I see you're wearing your big shorts with the baggy leg holes that
  flutter
  - so carelessly in the breeze. - Here's your paper.
  What are you doing here? Beat it, nerd.
  Thank you. Would you like to come inside
  for a cupcake and a glass of wine?
  Shut up, old man.
  What's going on in my pants?
  Looks like we got six more weeks of winter.
  We now return to Cutting in Line in Front of Italians.
  Hey, Copernicus, why don't you navigate yourself to the back of the line
  with your feet and stand there with your shirt?
  Hey, Peter, how was your golf game?
  Well, Lois, you tied my golf shoes a little tight before I left the
  house.
  Had to deal with that all day. Thank you very much.
  Oh, my God, look at Stewie!
  Peter, you took him out without any sunscreen?
  Maybe.
  You know the sun is dangerous for a baby's skin.
  Peter, this is more irresponsible
  than when you fed your mogwai after midnight.
  Peter, didn't the little Chinese man
  tell you not to feed him after midnight?
  Come on, Lois, he's so cute.
  And he's hungry. What could happen?
  Hello, I'm Fran Drescher.
  Kill it! Kill it!
  What the deuce are you all staring at?
  Is there something wrong with me?
  Wow, look at me.
  I'm a young Eartha Kitt.
"President Johnson, bring our boys home from Southeast Asia.
It's an unwinnable war..."
Dad, I was wondering if I could borrow $17.
Chris, what do you need money for? Isn't that why you have a paper
  route?
  No, this new kid named Kyle keeps stealing all my customers.
  Oh, that's terrible. You're a wonderful paperboy, Chris,
  and you need to remind your customers of that.
  She's right, you got to stand up for yourself.
  Like my great-grandfather, Turn-Of The-Century-Take-On-All-Comers
  Griffin.
  All right, put 'em up, put 'em up.
  Are you having a bully day? I'm having a bully day.
  Is everyone having a bully day?
  - Bully. - Bully. - Yes, Bully.
  Oh, thank God we live in this time.
  - Stewie, what are you doing? - Just getting my bronze on, baby.
  Hey, what do you think of my recumbent tan pose?
  Legs probably spread a little wider than they ought to be, but
  who gives a damn? This is just tan Stewie being tan Stewie.
  Check me out, Brian.
  Hey, Mr. Herbert, I want you back.
  Please, will you be my paper customer again?
  Oh, uh, hey, Chris. Oh, is that my phone?
  - Oh, better go get that. - Well, if it isn't King Lardass.
  - Don't call me names, Kyle. - Hi, Kyle.
  Well, listen, it was wrong of you to steal my customer away from me.
  - And I want him back. - Oh, yeah?
  - Look, Griffin got his ass kicked. - What a loser.
  I have that shirt at home.
  You... you pushed me.
  Boys, boys, we can settle this like reasonable and sexy teenagers.
  Whoever can swallow the most Tylenol PM wins.
  - Oh, my God, Chris, what happened?! - Kyle beat me up.
  - You let that little punk beat you up? - Peter, you should be more
  sympathetic.
  Remember, you had a bully, too, when you were his age.
  Yeah, you're right. Randy Fulcher used to pants me every chance he got.
  My book report is on The Giving Tree.
  Nerd!
  Randy!
  Nerd!
  Randy!
  - Nerd! - Randy!
  Peter, I think one of us should go over and have a talk with Kyle's
  parents.
  I'll do it, Lois. Right after a healthy breakfast of juice,
  toast and store brand imitation frosted flakes featuring Terry the
  Tiger.
  They'rrrre... food.
  Hey, ladies, you mind if I park here? I'll only be a few minutes.
  - Stewie, what is that on your lip? - I drew a pencil mustache.
  I like it 'cause it's just above my lip.
  The kind of mustache that says, "Yeah, I've been nude on camera. What
  of it?"
  Come here, I'll take care of that, sweetie.
  Ew, ew, it's got spit all over it.
  Now I know what it feels like to have dinner with Martin Landau.
  What people forget about Polanski is
  Polanski wasn't a perfectionist.
  And pedophile or not, he, he was a perfectly professional person.
  And punctual.
  Yeah, maybe we could talk about something else?
  You know my wife and I are very involved in Planned Parenthood.
  Which provides possibilities for people who are underprivileged.
  Maybe chew your food a little, champ.
  Who are all these people?
  Oh, just a few friends over to enjoy this gorgeous weather,
  and maybe take a dip in the pool. Hey, Devon, Devon, come here.
  Brian, this is Devon.
  Devon just finished directing a movie.
  Yeah, it, uh, stars a little actress named Joan Van Ark.
  Maybe you've heard of her.
  - Right. Possibly. - You're talking out of your ass.
  It doesn't matter, Brian, I'm tan.
  Hey, Brian, Brian, Brian,
  look at my tan walk.
  - Devon, do you have a cigarette? - Sure.
  And here's a copy of my last movie.
  It's essentially Brokeback Mountain from the point of view of the
  horses.
  Hey, the sun's been up for an hour. Shouldn't we get riding?
  - Uh, are they still sleeping? - I don't know. I'll check.
  - Hey, there. Are you Kyle's parents? - Yes. Can we help you?
  Yeah, I'm Peter Griffin.
  Listen, apparently your son got into a little scrape with my kid.
  - Oh, dear, they're not getting along? - Like an old guy and a midget.
  Sir, will you please stop staring at me?
  Where's the rest of ya?
  So, listen, Chris is pretty upset about what happened.
  Would you mind if I had a word with your son?
  Not at all. He's up in his room.
  Hey, there. Kyle?
  - Hey, I'm Chris Griffin's father. - Hey, I'm Chris Griffin's father.
  That's not very nice. I don't sound like that at all.
  You're making me sound like Michael Stipe.
  Listen, I just want you to know what you did the other day was wrong.
  - What you did the other day was wrong. - You're not making this easy,
  Kyle.
  You're not making this easy, Kyle. My name's Peter Griffin.
  I'm a big, fat, dumb butt-face.
  - Shut up, Kyle. - I'm Peter Griffin.
  - I'm a dorky, fat, numbnuts. - Kyle, I said shut up.
  You're a poop-nose.
  - Hey, Peter. - Hey, what's going on?
  - Is something wrong? - No, no.
  Everything's cool right now.
  Might be some problems later, but we'll cross that bridge when we come
  to it.
  Hello.
  Peter did what?!
  - Well, I'd best be getting to work. - It's nighttime.
  Boy, you said it. All right, take it easy.
  Peter, you get down from that tree this instant!
  No! You're gonna yell at me!
  You're damn right I'm gonna yell at you.
  You beat up a 13-year-old boy!
  He called me names!
  You're 43, and you just assaulted our neighbor's child!
  This is a very serious situation.
  Well, maybe you should have just had an abortion, Lois!
  Would that make you happy if I was never born?!
  What?
  I'm going to prison, aren't I?
  - What are you doing? - Got to keep the tan up.
  It's not a skin color, it's a lifestyle, Brian.
  See, you wouldn't know that because you're white as a ghost.
  You're haunting this house with your whiteness, Brian.
  Hey, wake me up in 15, will ya, babe?
  Fine.
  Key Largo, Montego
  Baby, why don't we go down to Kokomo?
  But not too fast 'cause Stewie takes it slow...
  Oh, crap! Stewie!
  Uh, hey, buddy. I was just coming to tell ya it's time to get out.
  I've been in there for six and a half hours, you son of a bitch!
  - Don't touch me! - Well, how, how...?
  - Can, can you get up? - I'll try.
  I can't do it! I can't do it!
  Get the lotion! Put the lotion on me!
  - Brian! - Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Furley.
  Never mind! I'll come back later!
  Now be polite, Peter.
  Kyle's mother agreed not to press charges if you apologize.
  - Hello, Lois. - Hello, Claire.
  We just came by because there's something
  Peter would like to say to Kyle.
  - Go on. - Slorry.
  - Say it right, Peter. - Ow! Ow! Sorry!
  Thank you, Peter. Now what do you say, Kyle?
  - Apology accepted. - Good.
  Now why don't you patch things up with Mr. Griffin by showing him your
  Legos?
  You got Legos? Aw, sweet!
  - Lois only buys me Mega Bloks. - They're the same thing, Peter.
  You know what, Lois? They are not the same thing.
  And the sooner you get that through your thick skull,
  the sooner we can get this marriage back on track.
  Hey, listen, uh, sorry about beating you up.
  I felt pretty bad about it.
  Hey, this look like a spaceship to you?
  Sorta.
  Well, I never was very good at building things.
  Like that time I built that handmade electric razor.
  By gluing many razor blades to this ordinary desk fan,
  I'll save time in my morning routine.
  Lois, I done it again.
  You don't have to apologize. I would have done the same thing.
  I mean, bullying makes you feel pretty cool.
  Yeah, guess it was kinda cool.
  You know, I always used to be the nerd getting bullied, but
  doing it to someone else was pretty sweet.
  And the more you do it, the sweeter it gets.
  Cook much?
  Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?!
  What's wrong with me? You're the one punching yourself in the face.
  Hey, Lois, how come you keep punching yourself in the face?
  - Knock it off! - You're gonna hurt yourself.
  - Ha! You're getting her good! - Hey, Stewie, nice sunburn.
  God, you horse's ass!
  Hey, Brian, you want some Stewie jerky?
  - Oh, God, that is disgusting. - I'm finally starting to peel.
  I'm telling you, Brian, my tanning days are over.
  I'm just glad I stopped before I did any real damage to my skin.
  I wouldn't be so sure.
  I don't remember you having that mole before.
  What the devil? Where did that come from?
  - Brian, what is that? - I don't know.
  Of course, your sunburn was pretty bad. I suppose it could be...
  the "C" word.
  What the hell does that have to do with anything?
  No, cancer.
  I-I thought you meant...
  It's not important... Oh, no!
  Cancer!
  Well, the mole looks benign, but we won't know for sure
  whether it's cancerous until the tests come back in a few days.
  A few days?!
  - I could be dead by then! - Relax, Stewie.
  He said it looks benign. We'll just have to wait and see.
  Jim Henson had a wait-and-see attitude and look what happened to him.
  Now we've got wrong-sounding Muppets!
  - Hey, Swedish chef. - Oh, hey, Kermit, what's going on?
  I'm hungry.
  Oh, that's no problem. I could cook you something. You want some
  spaghetti?
  That's, like, my specialty and junk.
  Dad, what's wrong with you?!
  Why are you acting like such a bully?
  'Cause there are two kinds of people in this world, Chris.
  There are bullies and there are nerds.
  And there are hot Asian chicks.
  They'll do what you want. Oh, yeah.
  Oh, yeah. You better believe it, buddy. They will do what you want
  because they know, they know what you want.
  Oh, oh, oh, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
  I won't hurt you.
  Me big American man.
  My point being that I'm a bully, not a nerd.
  Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.
  Dad, get away from me!
  Oh, in the kitchen, Meg?
  Brian, I may only have one week to live
  and I've got to make the most of it.
  Now, I've made a list of things I want to do before I die
  and you've got to help me since this is all your fault.
"Visit Chicago Museum of Art."
Okay, we can do that.
Next on your list, you want to learn to ballroom dance.
All right, if you're gonna make me do this, at least let me lead.
- Fine, you lead. - All right, then.
I love you.
- What? What'd you say? - Uh, olive juice.
- Olive juice? - Olive juice you, too.
Hey, you nerds wanna see a puppet show?
- Peter, put me down! - I told you, not until you sing.
High on a hill was a lonely goat herd...
Lay-hee-oh-da-lay-hee-oh da-lay-hee-hoo!
Dad, what are you doing to Mr. Swanson?
Peter, put him down right now!
- Beat it, Lois. - Peter, stop it!
- Joe is your friend. - Shut up, ya nerd!
Peter, look at yourself.
You are no different than that bully who used to pick on you.
Are you kidding? I'm nothing like Randy Fulcher.
Oh, no? Does that look familiar?
Oh, my God, you're right, Lois.
I shouldn't be bullying the people I care about.
I should be bullying Randy Fulcher!
He's the jerk in all this.
Like Dick Cheney when he was a Wal-Mart greeter.
Go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.
- Well, that's it for the list. - Not quite, Brian.
There's one more thing I need you to do before I die.
- Write down my final thoughts. - Oh, come on!
I don't have much time!
Oh, squiggly line in my eye fluid,
I see you there lurking on the periphery of my vision,
but when I try to look at you,
you scurry away.
Are you shy, squiggly line?
Why only when I ignore you do you return to the center of my eye?
Oh, squiggly line, it's all right.
You are forgiven.
Hello. Oh, hi, Dr. Hartman.
All right, I'll tell him. Thanks. Bye.
You don't have cancer. You're gonna be fine.
Really?! Oh, thank God! Oh, thank God!
Wait, wait. Look, there's no reason we can't finish the memoir anyway.
Let's see what you've got so far.
Oh, you are just the worst type of person.
Dad, what are we doing here?
Chris, I'm gonna show you how to stand up to a bully.
Hey, Fulcher!
Griffin?
- The feeling's mutual. - What are you doing here?
I'm here to kick your ass, Fulcher.
I'm gonna beat ya, and then my son Chris is gonna beat ya.
It's gonna be an old-fashioned father-son beat-off.
Wait a minute, Dad. You can't hit him!
- Yeah, I have MS. - Oh, you hear that, Chris?
This guy's got a monkey scrotum and he's bragging about it.
Now you really got me mad.
No, Dad!
Sorry I had to do that, Dad.
But you wanted me to learn to stand up to a bully.
Well, I'm standing up to you.
Stop bullying people, Dad!
My God, Chris, you're right.
Look at me. Look what I've become.
I thought it'd feel good to be a bully, but
all I did was make people feel as bad as Randy made me feel.
- I'm just a big jackass. - It's all right, Dad. I forgive you.
As long as you promise never to bully anyone again.
I promise, Chris.
I mean, you know, unless I get really stinkin' drunk,
in which case all you got to do is outrun your sister.
Oh, I like that. That's nice. That's a warm family moment.
I agree. We can all learn something from that.
Wocka, wocka... Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?



Title: Airport 07

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Redneck Comedy Tour!
  Featuring...
  You know you're a redneck if you come from a rural area and behave as
  such.
  Oh, that dog of mine!
  You tell me how that got in there!
  He's right.
  Who knows how that got in there?
  Peter, can we please go now? This is excruciating.
  Are you kidding, Brian?
  These men and their redneck lifestyle really speak to me.
  This is the greatest show I've seen in years.
  Not like the last time I was at a comedy club.
  I hear this guy's hilarious. He played Kramer, you know.
  Oh, this is gonna be fun!
  Peter... what the hell are you doing with a pickup truck?
  Wait. Let me guess.
  This is because of the Redneck Comedy Festival, isn't it?
  Oh, that dog of mine.
  Peter, you can't suddenly decide to be a redneck just because of some
  show.
  Some show?
  Lois, those men showed me the way to an identity
  I've been searching for my whole life.
  I am going to do everything a redneck is supposed to do.
  This is going to be more painful to watch
  than when he ate half a Fudgesicle in one bite.
  Oh, boy! A Fudgesicle!
  Chris, what happened to the couch?
  Dad dragged it out on the lawn, 'cause he said
  that's what rednecks do.
  Hey, Meg, come here. Have a seat.
  Dad, what are you doing?
  Meg, I'm a redneck,
  which means I am about to do something to you
  that you will not remember until you're 40.
  Meg, come back here!
  I meant sex!
  We now return to Carl Sagan's Cosmos,
  edited for rednecks.
  I'm Carl Sagan.
  Just how old is our planet?
  Scientists believe it's four bil...
  ...hundreds and hundreds of years old.
  Scientists have determined that the universe was created by...
  God...!
  ...big bang.
  - If you look at the bones of a... - Jesus.
  ...aurus Rex, it's clear, by the use of carbon-dating that...
  Mountain Dew is the best soda ever made.
  - Peter, do we have to watch this? - This is what rednecks watch, Brian.
  Peter, that's disgusting. Here. Spit in this cup instead.
  Oh, there's my apple juice.
  Stewie, wait. Don't...
  Where's my money?
  You going to give me my money?
  Never mind.
  Hey, Brian, check it out!
  Peter, you painted over the back window. Isn't that dangerous?
  I'm a redneck, Brian.
  We like people driving behind us to know what our beliefs are.
  Peter, what the hell?! My car!
  Aw, damn it! Hey! Hey, come back!
  Oh, sorry, Quagmire.
  How the hell am I supposed to get to the airport?!
  I got to fly a plane in 20 minutes.
  Oh, I can drive you. I got a pickup truck. See?
  Well, come on!
  - Quagmire, I am so sorry. - Don't worry about it.
  - We can go after them. - Don't worry about it.
  They're tagged! They're tagged! Just get me to the airport.
  All right. Thanks a lot, Peter.
  That's all the motivation I need to actually do this.
  Did we finish fueling?
  Do you see the hose in the plane?
  No.
  Well, then, I guess we're finished.
  Thanks, George. You want to say that one more time without the sarcasm?
  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain,
  Glenn Quagmire.
  We're looking at about a four-and-a-half-hour flight time
  today.
  We've got clear skies, good visibility.
  The temperature in Atlanta is 64 degrees.
  The flight's going to be a little longer than we've expected.
  We've got some very strong headwinds... giggety.
  Uh, flight attendants, please prepare for takeoff.
  What the hell?!
  Oh, my God! We're going down!
  Secure your own mask first, and then assist the child!
  - But the bag's not inflating! - It's all right!
  Even though oxygen is flowing, the bag may not inflate!
  That was too close.
  Sir, we have a confirmed crash. Flight 37 is down.
  We'd better alert the mayor. I'll have to interrupt his photo op.
  My Pet Goat. Page one.
"You know, said my pet goat, I'm sure, if I watched Grey's Anatomy, I'd
  like it,"
"but I just don't have the time."
"You should make the time, said the farmer."
Our top story : There was drama in the skies of Quahog today,
as a Trans National 767 was forced to make a crash-landing.
That's right, Diane. As if the world weren't already scary enough,
it seems you can't even get on a plane safely these days.
Channel 5 has the spectacular footage.
Fortunately, no one was injured.
However, using state-of-the-art Channel 5 computer technology,
we'll show you how disastrous it could have been.
Here's how it would have looked if the plane had crashed into a school.
Now here's how it would've looked if the plane had crashed
into a school for bunnies.
Now here's how it would've looked if the plane had crashed
into a school for bunnies but one passenger had survived,
gone home, and mercilessly beat his wife.
I'm alive!
But boy, am I angry!
Someone's gonna have to pay for this!
Why! Why!
Is this because I overcooked the roast?!
Powerful stuff.
You'd have to be made of stone not to feel saddened by that.
Boy, Quagmire, I'm really sorry they fired you.
I feel like this is partially my fault.
No, Peter, it's perfectly normal to siphon jet fuel from an active
  runway
  with the intention of flying a pickup truck.
  Look, I know I caused a lot of trouble, but my redneck days are over.
  No more crotch shots of me getting out of a car.
  Well, what are you gonna do now, Quagmire?
  Hey, it-it's all right.
  I got enough in my savings until I find another job.
  I'll be fine.
  Mom! Dad! There's somebody in my tree house!
  Yeah, and there's an annoying little homo screaming in my kitchen.
  Which one do you think I'm more pissed about?
  I'll remind you that I was invited here!
  All right, who's up there?
  - Oh, hey, Peter. Hey, Lois. - Glenn, what are you doing up there?
  Oh, I kind of moved in, if that's okay.
  No airline'll hire me after the accident.
  I'm broke and jobless.
  Quagmire, you belong in a tree. You're a nut.
  What?!
  Come on down, Quagmire. You're staying with us.
  Oh, great. This is gonna be worse than the time I lived with Marlee
  Matlin.
  Hi, Stewie.
  Oh, come on, Marlee, I know you can't hear them,
  but you got to feel those things slapping out of there!
  Listen, I really want to thank you guys for taking me in in my time of
  need.
  Aw, forget it, Quagmire. It's the least we could do after what happened.
  Hello?
  Oh, you must have a wrong number.
  There's no one here by the name of Longrod Von Hugendong.
  - Okay, now add 20. - Okay.
  - Now multiply it by four. - Okay.
  - And what do you got? - 8,008.
  And what does 8,008 look like on a calculator?
  Oh, "boob"!
  Boob! Yeah! All right! All right! All right!
  Boob!
  What if we had two calculators and we put them next to each other?
  Yes, yes, yes.
  Find one, yes!
  Didn't mean to wake ya.
  Peter, you and I need to talk about Quagmire.
  He's been living with us for over a month, and I think it's enough now.
  Lois, I'm the whole reason he lost his job and his house.
  Besides, I can't throw my best friend out on the street
  like a prom night Dumpster baby.
  Hey, what are you doing out here? Don't you want to dance?
  Sure!
  I'm just a prom night Dumpster baby
  I got no mom or dad
  Prom night Dumpster baby
  My story isn't long, but boy, it's awfully sad
  - And though I came from a hole - And though he came from a
  hole
  - I'm singing right from the soul - He's singing right from
  the soul
  My fanny needs a blanket And somebody to spank it
  - I miss my mom - But she's at the prom
  So I'm a prom night Dumpster baby
  Prom night Dumpster baby
  - And I'm takin' a stroll - He's takin' a stroll
  - I'm takin' a stroll - He's takin' a stroll
  - I'm takin' a stroll - He's takin' a stroll
  - I'm takin' a stroll - He's takin' a stroll
  I'm takin' a stroll.
  Besides, Quagmire doesn't even have a job.
  Well, you're gonna have to help him find one,
  because I've had enough of him living in this house.
  You're overreacting, Lois.
  And you can't spell "overreacting" without "ovary."
  - 'Cause you're a girl. - I'm not overreacting!
  Hey, uh, just an FYI,
  really no reason to go into any greater detail than this.
  Uh, Stewie should probably never use this pacifier again.
  Okay, so I'll talk to him tomorrow?
  - So how's the job hunt going? - It's awful, Cleveland.
  - Quagmire blew every gig we got him. - It's too bad.
  I really liked that job working on the Starship Enterprise.
  Dude,
  you got to introduce me to that black chick.
  Guys, the only thing I know how to do is fly a plane.
  That's what I was born for.
  And I'll never be happy unless I can do it again.
  Then that's the only answer.
  Somehow we've got to get Quagmire his job back.
  Fellas, I think I have an idea.
  Okay, guys, let's go over the plan one more time.
  Quagmire will pose as an airline passenger on the 6:00 flight
  to New York.
  Then Joe and I will sneak into the flight attendants' lounge
  while Cleveland distracts the security personnel.
  Once we have the uniforms and credentials,
  Cleveland, Joe and I will board the plane posing as flight
  attendants.
  Once we're in the air, we drug the pilots.
  At which point, Quagmire is forced to step in and land the
  plane safely,
  making him a hero.
  Everybody clear?
  Boy, this sounds like more trouble than a moose on the interstate.
  Hey, can you help me out?
  I'm trying to get a couple of bucks for something to eat.
  - What's "moose stuff"? - Whatever you want it to be.
  I could have sex with you
  or I could just stand over there and drink from the lake.
  And everything in between.
  Get in.
  All right, I'm gonna go bring the pilots their coffee.
  Hang on to something, 'cause this ride's about to get rougher
  than dating a hot girl with a bad laugh.
  - I really like you, Sandy. - I really like you, too, Peter.
  Yeah? You like it when I kiss you here?
  - Yeah. - How about here?
  Oh, stop, I'm tick...
  Ma'am, I hate to be a nuisance,
  but your son stopped kicking the back of my chair.
  Thank you.
  Oh, no!
  Both the pilots are unconscious, and we're in a nosedive.
  If only there was someone on board who could save us.
  I said if only there was someone on board who could save us.
  Uh, Peter, I don't see Quagmire.
  - Oh, that was great. - Thanks.
  I know you have a choice in airport sex, and I appreciate your choosing
  Quagmire.
  Please exercise caution when standing up,
  as the contents of your panties may have shifted during coitus.
  All right, I got a plane to catch. Say, which gate is flight 209?
  209? That flight left half an hour ago.
  Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
  That plane's going down! My friends are on that plane! They're all
  gonna die!
  - What?! Oh, no! - And that's not the worst part.
  Here's the condom I said I put on.
  Aren't I just the worst?
  - Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. - And I'm Diane Simmons.
  More trouble in the skies over Quahog tonight,
  as a Trans National jet is apparently out of control.
  Channel 5 has this exclusive recording of a mayday communication from
  the cockpit.
  Hey, there, son. Mind if I have a seat?
  Hugh Hefner?!
  You look like you got something on your mind.
  Ah, who the hell am I kidding? I don't deserve to be a pilot.
  - I've let everybody down. - Did you do the best you could?
  No. I was gonna, but I ended up getting laid instead.
  That reminds me of a guy you might've heard of.
  John Holmes.
  Greatest porn star who ever lived.
  You know what he once said?
  He said : "You know, I've got a 13-inch member..."
"and Glenn Quagmire is the best damn pilot I've ever seen."
- John Holmes said that? - You bet he did...
right before he died a very painful, AIDS-related death
from having unprotected sex with so many people.
Excuse me, Hef.
I got a plane to land.
- We're all gonna die! - I can't believe this is happening!
- Help us! - Help!
Men, we're doing everything in our power to get you down.
Stand aside, sir. I'll take it from here.
Peter, this is Quagmire.
Now I want you to listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
Take a firm hold of the throttle, and pull the red mixture knob out
  slowly.
  Okay.
  All right, now do you see a button that looks like a drunken gay guy
  eyeing you from across the bar?
  Yeah, I see it.
  All right, press the button right above it.
  Some new developments in the flight 209 drama.
  Recently discharged pilot Captain Glenn Quagmire
  is apparently talking the plane down.
  Ollie Williams has the story. Ollie?
  - I'm at the wrong airport. - Oops. Well, thanks, Ollie.
  Coming up : Why calling every Asian man you meet "Chung King"
  can land an anchorman in hot water. After this.
  All right, Peter, slide the red knob all the way out.
  And the second those wheels touch the ground, you hit the emergency
  brake.
  - We made it! - Hallelujah!
  Get some!
  Well, guess there's nothing left to do but watch the end of Last
  Holiday.
  Damn!
  Oh, no, she di-in't.
  - Oh, yes, she did. - No, she di-in't.
  - Yes, she did. - No, she di-in't.
  - Yes, she did, Peter! I just saw it! - All right, take it easy.
  Ah, Glenn, we are so thrilled for you.
  Yeah, guess it didn't take too much for you to get your job back,
  - now that you're a hero. - Yeah, and I'm so happy for you,
  I don't even mind that I was raped in a federal prison
  after I was arrested for hijacking.
  Well, I couldn't have done it without you, guys.
  You put yourselves on the line and you gave me my life back.
  I'll never forget that.
  Now, if you'll excuse me. I got to go to work.



Title: Bill and Peter Bogus Journey

This was such a great idea for a weekend activity.
  Well, I thought it'd be good to get out of the house.
  I don't like the kids being around that racist sunflower
  that's growing in our yard.
  Hey, boy,
  - don't you come walking by this house. - You're ignorant.
  Hey, Mr. Eel.
  You're slippery.
  Oops, got away.
  Left my hand smelling funny.
  Come here, Jesse. Smell my finger.
  Today was a good day.
  Hey, look, kids, it's a recreation of the lost city of New Orleans.
  Dad, was there ever a real city of New Orleans?
  No one knows, Chris. No one knows.
  Hey, Brian, look, I'm a stripper.
  I'm working my way through college.
  I should be more reluctant to take my clothes off,
  but I'm not because my stepfather had boundary issues.
  Hey, there, Mr. Octopus.
  I see you got two eyes but not much else.
  We can fix that.
  Let's give you a nice tweedlie little mustache here.
  And maybe a big ol' dumb guy smiley mouth.
  And a couple of eyebrows with one raised up
  like you're saying, "Say what?"
  Oh. Look who's got pimples.
  And right before the big dance.
  It's so sucky and squeezy!
  I'll handle this.
  I've tangled with the likes of these before.
  Wow, that was awesome, Mr. Seamus.
  Ah, it was nothing. That's how I caught old Woody over there.
  In other news, former president Bill Clinton was in town today
  to judge Quahog's annual Miss Cankle USA contest.
  Now that's a cankle.
  Where does the calf fat end and the ankle fat begin?
  Who knows? That's the fun.
  Brian, what is this on my shoe?
  - My poop. - That's right, and it's disgusting.
  I am sick of you using the front yard as your bathroom.
  It's time you learned to use the toilet like everyone else.
  I'm going to sneeze, I'm going to sneeze...
  Bye, Lois. I'm going to the gym.
  Okay, see ya la... Wait. What?
  Since when do you go to the gym?
  Well, it's just that whole thing at the aquarium made me realize
  I'm completely out of shape.
  I mean, what if I run into that octopus again?
  - Peter, that's ridiculous. - Ready for round two, man?
  I got all day. Hey, is that your wife?
  Hey, I didn't know you guys work out here?
  Yeah, it's a weekly regiment.
  Come on, come on, Cleveland, push it.
  Come on, come on, push it, push it.
  Come on, it's all you, it's all you, it's all...
  Hey.
  Glenn, Glenn, Glenn, Glenn...
  Will you guys quiet down? I'm trying to concentrate on my cardio.
  Hey, you guys the trainers here?
  Why, look, Barnaby, a new recreation enthusiast.
  We'll start off your workout with vigorous calisthenics
  executed in rhythmic time with acetate pressings
  of the new musical craze called jazz.
  Steak and eggs and eggs and steak
  That's what you should have for breakfast
  Delicious
  Steak and eggs and eggs and steak
  Just making sure you heard
  I got it.
  - How do you think it works? - I have no idea.
  Look, Lois told me I had to start using the toilet
  and you're the one who's had potty training, so
  - I'm counting on you to help me. - All right.
  We're two intelligent guys, we can figure this out.
  What's that big back part?
  Maybe that's where the wizard lives who operates this thing.
  It would be wise not to anger him.
  I wonder what this thing is for.
  Brian, be careful with that. We don't know what it does.
  All right, here goes.
  Oh, God, oh, God, careful, careful. Careful. Careful.
  Don't mind me, you guys.
  I'm just writing a letter to my boyfriend.
"Dear, my boyfriend,"
"Thank you for making out with me recently on purpose. That was cool."
"Those flowers that you totally sent me were really pretty,"
"just like you said I am."
"Love, Meg."
Meg, you are so full of crap. You're like those people who sit in
  Starbucks
  and publicly write on their laptops.
  Hey, getting some writing done there, buddy?
  Yeah, setting up in public so everybody can watch me type my big
  screenplay.
  Me, too. All real writers need to be seen writing,
  - otherwise, what's the point, right? - You should totally write that
  down.
  Okay. Will you watch me?
  Hello, flabby, out-of-shape family. Check out my bulging rippliness.
  Peter, you've been to the gym once...
  for 15 minutes.
  And I'm 15 minutes stronger, Brian.
  I'd rip a phone book in half, but for the life of me,
  I don't know anyone who uses a phone book anymore.
  So I'll use Meg's laptop.
  Dad! What the hell?!
  Look at him in that tank top.
  He looks more pathetic than John Merrick when he went on Match.com.
  There's no way you're a size six.
  I haven't felt this good in years.
  I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger
  without the fruity accent and the Pirates of the Caribbean wife.
  Excuse me, sir. Secret Service. I wonder if we might ask for your
  assistance.
  - Yeah, what's the problem? - We're with President Clinton's motorcade.
  It seems he blew a tire in front of your house.
  Would you happen to have a jack we could borrow?
  You don't need a jack. I am a jack.
  Come on, I'll lift that thing for you.
  Hey, I appreciate your help, man.
  We're a little overloaded 'cause I'm having a fat chick party back here.
  All right, girls. I've turned off the AC.
  First one to have a bead of neck sweat reach their butt crack wins.
  All right, boys, now watch how this is done.
  The key is to put it all in your groin and your back.
  Take your legs totally out of the equation.
  Lift with your lower back in a jerking, twisting motion.
  - Peter! - My God!
  Call an ambulance!
  All right, so which one of y'all ain't got my herpes yet?
  How's the hernia, Peter?
  You know what the worst part of it is, Lois?
  I thought I was just out of shape, but that ain't it at all.
  I got to face the fact that I'm just getting old.
  Knock, knock.
  Mr. President, what are you doing here?
  Well, I felt so bad that Peter hurt himself fixing my car,
  I wanted to stop by and extend my good wishes.
  Whoa! Bill Clinton!
  Hey, can I get a picture of you on my cell phone?
  Sure.
  You know where I got that nipple ring?
  Ol' Straddlin' Madeleine Albright gave it to me.
  Say, you look like you're pretty down, Peter.
  It's just that I'm starting to realize I'm not as young as I used to be.
  I hear you.
  After my bypass, I remember wondering if it was all downhill from there.
  But then I realized it doesn't have to be.
  You're only as young as you feel.
  I don't know, Reagan, I wish I could believe that.
  I'm going to make you believe it.
  When you get out of here, I'm going to take you out
  and show you the time of your life.
  And by the time we're done,
  I promise you're going to feel like a young man again.
  Well, if you really think it'll help.
  I sure do. Know what else will help?
  A little saxophone therapy.
  You can have me.
  What's that?
  Since I couldn't help you learn to use the toilet, I found something
  that can.
  It's an instructional video on toilet training.
  Hi, I'm Roy Scheider.
  And today we're going to learn to use the potty.
  Folks, say hi to my pal Hungry Hank.
  - How's it going, Hank? - I'm hungry for your poo.
  Don't make me starve.
  Remember, it's all about relaxing
  and letting your body do what it does naturally.
  Now, here's Susan St. James to powder my ass.
  All right, Peter, we've got a big day ahead of us.
  I'm going to show you that age is just a state of mind.
  - Come on, hop in my limo. - Wow, a limo!
  Shotgun!
  - Watch the screen, not your feet. - Bill, shut up, I got it.
  Number 32.
  - Oh, no, our pizza's ready. - Tag out, man, tag out.
  I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
  Wrapped in plastic, it's fantastic
  Come on, Barbie, let's go party...
  Oh, boy, this is going to be fun.
  I haven't made a crank call in years.
  Shh! Quiet, quiet. It's ringing.
  Hello?
  Hello, is this Linda Tripp?
  Yes.
  You shouldn't have talked, you stupid bitch! I hope you die!
  Boy, that, uh...
  that wasn't really a crank call, that was...
  - that was just unpleasant. - Sorry about that.
  It's okay. You know what, Bill? You were right.
  Ever since you and I have been hanging out, I feel 20 years younger.
  You've completely changed my life.
  See, I told you, Peter, age is just a state of mind.
  So what do you want to do next?
  Go to Mars, dude.
  - Boy, I'm getting kind of hungry. - Me, too.
  Hey! Hey, pull over, man! Pull over!
  Dude, check it out!
  There's a pig behind that fence.
  Oh, yeah, I see it!
  Dude, we could eat that pig!
  - What? - Dude, come on!
  We could totally eat that pig.
  We could... we could do it, man! We could!
  It would be so easy, man! It would take, like a minute.
  Could it really be that fast?
  Peter, that pig...
  could be in our stomachs in, like one minute, and then we could...
  and then... and then we could do other stuff.
  All right. I'm starved. Let's do it.
  Who's there?!
  Aw, crap! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
  Dog gone it!
  If he wanted a pig, why didn't he just take my wife?
  And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty.
  There's no needin going over
  All the things that took me under...
  Hello, old friend.
  - What the hell?! - No! No!
  You do not go on this lawn! Brian, I've had enough of this.
  It's more disgusting than when you gave me that Christmas gift.
  Oh, what is it? A little birdie?
  Oh, my God! It's dead!
  Brian!
  Oh, Brian, this is disgusting! Oh, my God! Get it out of here!
  I'm... I'm sorry. I thought... I thought you'd like it.
  Brian, I love it!
  I'm going to call you Stickyhead.
  I love you, Stickyhead.
  Brian, if you're not going to use the toilet, there's only one solution.
  Brian, did you know that Brad Pitt is John Lithgow's nephew?
  - He is? - No.
  But doesn't that sound like something that could be true?
  My God! You're wearing a diaper!
  - You look silly. - Why? You wear a diaper.
  Yes, but I'm a baby.
  People see my diaper, and they say :
"Oh, how cute! I bet he smells like baby powder."
They see your diaper and think : "Ew! That dog is sick. He must be
  dying."
"I hope he doesn't leak on our carpet. Why don't they just put him to
  sleep?"
  You know, at this point, I'd probably welcome that.
  Oh, hey, come on, man. You just got to get used to it.
  Hey, have you gone yet?
  Have you popped your butt cherry?
  You know, you should be more sensitive to my humiliation.
  Remember how bad you felt when you drew that picture for Peter and Lois?
  Oh, Stewie, it's wonderful!
  This is going right up on the fridge.
  Really?! The fridge?!
  It's like we have a little Michelangelo in the house.
  Okay! See you guys later.
  I almost lost it when you said to put it on the fridge.
  I know! What the hell is this supposed to be, a pelican or a school bus?
  Looks like Muhammad Ali drew this.
  What a dumbass! Hey, let's spit on it.
  Peter!
  Oh! Oh, Lois!
  Let me make you some coffee.
  Oh, boy, a pig! Can we keep it? Ow! It bit me!
  What the hell did you and Bill do last night?!
  We lived, Lois. We lived our lives.
  Peter, that former President Clinton is nothing but a bad influence!
  I forbid you to hang out with him anymore.
  No way. Bill Clinton makes me feel young.
  Not like you, with your Judd Hirsch sweater
  and your bag of Werther's Originals.
  If he won't listen, I'm just going to have to go talk to Bill Clinton
  myself.
  Mr. President, I need to have a word with you!
  Wow! You certainly are very persuasive.
  So I've been told.
  Hey, you want to give me that cigar. I'm ready to smoke it now.
  What the hell was I thinking? I-I don't know what came over me.
  Oh, God! What am I going to do?
  Hey, Bill, you up for a little bowling?
  I swiped some money out of Lois's purse. I don't think she'll notice
  because she's here humping you?!
  Peter!
  Look, I know this looks bad, and I feel horrible, and
  I know nothing I could say to you could possibly justify
  why I slept with Bill except...
  I mean, Peter, the man presided over the longest economic expansion in
  US history,
  and he reduced the percentage of Americans on welfare
  to its lowest level in 33 years.
  - 35 years. - 35 years, Peter.
  Well, well. I learned something today.
  Apparently, there's the side of Bill Clinton the world knows,
  and then there's the dark, sex-crazed side only I know.
  I'm so sorry, Peter.
  Lois, I think maybe it's better if I stay at Quagmire's for a while.
  I understand.
  Hey, Lois, you up for a little exit polling?
  Oh, God!
  I've been a worse wife than Lorena Bobbitt
  when she was married to The Thing.
  Oh, my God! Where is it?! Where did she throw it?!
  Oh, God! Oh, God!
  Is this what you're looking for?
  I can't believe Lois would cheat on me.
  Look, Peter, I know this is a very difficult time for you,
  but I want you to know I'm here for you if you need anything.
  Quagmire, I know your heart's in the right place, but
  I need to sort this out for myself.
  I haven't misjudged someone this bad since my last physical.
  All right.
  The doctor will be in in a few minutes.
  Peter? Peter, are you in there? It's me.
  What do you want?
  Honey, I just feel awful about this whole situation.
  But I think I've got a solution that will make things right for both of
  us.
  - I'm listening. - Well...
  the way I figure it, the only way to even things out between us
  is if you have sex with someone else, too.
  You...
  - want to get me laid? - Yes, Peter.
  - Because I don't want to lose you. - Well, it would make us even.
  All right, Lois, if you really think it'll work.
  Trust me. It'll work better than the first telephone.
  Well, we did it, Watson. What an afternoon.
  We've finally perfected the first telephone.
  Yeah. Uh...
  Hey, listen, somebody called me today. Uh...
  Whoever it was said some
  very sexual things. Some very angry, sexual things.
  Oh, really?
  Probably just some teenagers somewhere. Damn them.
  Well, that's the thing. I mean, there's only two phones in the...
  well, in the world, and
  one of them is in my office, and the other's in your office, and
  those two didn't even exist until about a few hours ago.
  Yikes! I could use a distraction right now.
  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty.
  I can almost hear the stillness
  As it yields to the sound of your heart beating
  All right, Peter, who's it going to be? Who do you want to sleep with?
  Who we kidding, Lois? This is never going to work.
  - Let's just forget the whole thing. - No, honey, it's got to work.
  Just pick somebody, and I'll make it happen.
  Deep down, in your heart of hearts,
  if it could be anyone in the world, who would it be?
  Halle Berry? Ann-Margret?
  - Anybody I want? - Anybody.
  Don't be afraid to tell me.
  Babs.
  - My mother? - Yeah.
  Why?
  It was my understanding that there would be no questions asked.
  I'm just curious. It's a little weird.
  Look, you know what? She's hot.
  Guilty, all right?
  I haven't been so struck by a woman's beauty
  since I was Uma Thurman's eye-wrangler on the set of Pulp Fiction.
  No. You can't promise something like that.
  I have no idea what you're going to say to me.
  So you can go ahead and say what you're going to say,
  and my natural response could be to get offended.
  Then, through no fault of my own, I wouldn't have kept my promise.
  Hang on!
  Okay!
  Well, Lois, this is an unexpected surprise.
  You and Peter should drop by more often.
  Well, we were in the neighborhood, and Peter said, "Let's stop in."
  - Wasn't that thoughtful? - Will you people quiet down?
  I'm trying to watch Medium.
  You know what? Daddy's right. Let's go upstairs where we won't bother
  him.
  Good.
  All right. Go, Medium!
  Wish I could talk to ghosts. That would be sweet!
  Mom, could we sit down for a second?
  - I have to ask you something. - What is it, Lois?
  Well, Peter and I have hit a snag in our marriage. I won't go with the
  details.
  But it turns out that the only way to make things right seems to be...
  It... it's, uh... Oh, boy.
  What's the best way to say this?
  Um... Mom...
  Would you have sex with Peter?
  - Of course, dear. - Really?
  Carter's been most insufferable lately,
  and this would just stick in his craw.
  I like your freaky spirit, but it's your craw I'm after.
  - I didn't think you'd be so receptive. - Are you kidding, Lois?
  I'm physically starved.
  Your father's utterly lost interest.
  He won't even look me in the back of the head anymore.
  I see.
  Well, I guess we're good to go then.
  Peter, are you sure this is what you want?
  Yeah. I'll see you at home.
  Lois, wait!
  I can't do it! I can't go through with it!
  You have to, Peter, for the sake of our marriage!
  Screw our marriage! I love you!
  - Really? - Absolutely.
  And I don't care that you slept with Clinton. We'll get past it somehow.
  All I know is,
  I don't want to do anything to hurt you.
  Oh, Peter!
  - Why are you naked in my house? - Uh...
  Why aren't you?
  You're all right, Griffin.
  Well, Peter, our marriage has suffered a serious trial, but
  - I think we can get through it. - Me, too, Lois.
  It's just going to take a little work.
  In the meantime, I guess I better clear the air with Clinton.
  Hey, listen, Bill, uh... you and I need to have a talk.
  Boy, you are good. You are really good.
  Well, look at you, using the toilet. I am so proud of you.
  Well, you deserve all the praise for encouraging me to do it.
  Well, still, good for you.
  So where are you really doing your business?
  Oh, I found a place.
  Well, I'll be damned.
  And they called me crazy.
  You can't plant sausage seeds, they said.
  Well, look at this!



Title: No Meals on Wheels

We now return to America's Next Top Model.
  I just don't think you're being fair, Tyra.
  You don't know what it's like to grow up the way I grew up.
  You know what? How dare you?! You don't know me.
  You have no idea where I come from, where I've been,
  how long I've been there,
  what I had to do to get from where I was to where I am now!
  - Hey there, Mort. - Hi, Lois.
  Neil's doing a report on Christianity at school.
  Do you have any crucifixes I can borrow?
  Preferably one without the little fellow on it?
  Oh, of course, there's one in the den. Help yourself.
  God, I'm sick of Mort always borrowing our stuff.
  He's a bigger mooch than the Mexican Super Friends.
  Hey, Mexican Superman, can I talk to you for a sec?
  When you signed the lease, you said there was going to be like
  five of you living here.
  Oh, no, they're not all living here. They're just visiting.
  Hey, Mexican Superman, I got the keys made.
  Hey, Mexican Batman, get out of here.
  - What? I got like 60 keys. - Silencio!
  - Jefe aqui! - Que?
  Evicion.
  That ought to keep Mort away.
  Peter, what the hell is that?
  Lois, I'm tired of Mort always mooching off us,
  so I made a scare-Jew.
  Peter, we're not gonna have this in our front yard.
  It's racist, and for God's sake, you ruined your best suit.
  Now we're gonna have to get you a new one...
  Shh. Lois Lois, look.
  Hey, guys, I just wanted to return your...
  Oh! Oh, my God, it's Hitler! He's back!
  He's back! Hurry, protect Jon Stewart!
  He's our most important Jew!
  Why do wo get me a suit here?
  Well, since you keep ruining them, I'm not going to buy you a brand-new
  one.
  Yes, I'll take this teddy bear, this ruler,
  this piece of string and this cardboard box.
  Oh, look, an "On The Raggedy Ann" doll.
  It's water weight, you bastard!
  Get off me! I'm not your whore.
  I'm sorry, I'm just so sad.
  Well, I guess I can still play with it three weeks out of the month.
  - Hi, there. See anything you like? - Oh, I'm just browsing.
  Say, you look like you could use an activity book
  with half the activities done.
  - That would save me half the time. - Connect the dots?
  Ha! More like set the book down and have a beer.
  You got yourself a deal.
  What... are those?!
  Oh, that's a pair of red flannel feety pajamas.
  Good Lord.
  See, they've got a flap that opens up in the back.
  Are you telling me I could be pooping and warm?
  Exactly.
  No longer would I have to make a choice between the two.
  Sir, here is a check with my name on it.
  Write down any number on this piece of paper, and I will pay it.
  All right, so we roll the dice
  and then we both have to yell "Yahtzee" really loud.
  - At the same time? - Yeah.
  And you have to flap your wrists like this.
  And you'll do it, too?
  - Of course, that's how it's done. - Okay.
  - All right, ready? - Okay, you gonna do with me?
  Oh, yeah.
  Yahtzee!
  - Gay. - You suck!
  Hey, everybody, I'm home from work.
  My God, Peter, you wore those pajamas to your office?
  Hey, at least I'm mixing it up a little bit.
  Green shirt, tan pants, that's refreshing.
  Oh, boy does it feel good to undo my butt flap.
  Ew, Dad! We don't want to sit here and look at your ass.
  Yes, I'd rather look at Meg toweling off after a shower
  when she does that butt floss thing.
  Ew, ew, that's so disgusting.
  Ugh, ugh, I hope I don't ever accidentally use that towel.
  Lois, I have never been more comfortable
  as a person than I am in these feety pajamas.
  All warm and furry.
  This is what it feels like to be a bear.
  You remember what I used to say, Lois, when we first got married?
  You remember? I used to say : "What would it feel like to be a bear?"
  Well, this is it. This is it.
  - I'm living it, baby. - No, you're not.
  You've been wearing those things for three days.
  You can wear them to bed, but tomorrow we're getting rid of them.
  Fine.
  Screw up all my fuzziness.
  What the hell was that?
  Oh, my God.
  Lois, don't get alarmed, but
  I think I might be Jesus.
  I'm Jesus.
  Peter, that's a static shock.
  Your pajamas created a charge of electricity
  when you dragged your feet across the carpet,
  and when you touched Chris, you passed it on.
  Kneel before Christ!
  Dad!
  I am not your dad.
  I am Electric Man.
  Damn it, Peter, stop it!
  I got to tell you, you're pissing me off
  worse than when I watched the O.J. verdict with my old roommate.
  We the jury find the defendant Orenthal James Simpson,
  not guilty...
  - Yes! - What the hell?!
  - What?! - What?!
  - Maybe we should get new roommates. - Yeah, maybe we should.
  Peter.
  I know you're in here.
  Yes, I am, Lois.
  But where?
  Peter, if you shock me, I swear to God I'm leaving you.
  You'll have to find me first, Lois.
  Where could I be?
  Well, there's a Quonset hut that I've never seen in this room before.
  - I got to figure you're in there. - How do you know, Lois?
  I could be in that New York style magazine kiosk.
  Peter, this all looks very expensive.
  Yes, you might say it was...
  shockingly expensive.
  I'm going to try the Quonset hut.
  I was in the bathroom.
  The hut and the kiosk... decoys, Lois, decoys!
  Glen, thank you so much for helping me tear up my carpet.
  Well, you know, Lois, I got to confess,
  when you called me I sort of misunderstood what you were asking for.
  That's why I rushed over. But, uh...
  Well, it's fine, it's fine, whatever, I'm happy to help.
  What the hell is this?
  Peter, I've had it with all your shocking.
  Since you won't get rid of those pajamas, I'm getting rid of the
  carpets.
  Hey, Lois, you want me to leave a little strip in this thing?
  Maybe a lightning bolt, unicorn, something like that?
  - No, I want it all gone, Glen. - All right, we're going Brazilian.
  Hey, what's this?
  - Some kind of really old coin. - Huh. Let me see that.
  Wait a minute, do you know what this is?
  This is an 18th-century Rhode Island ship token.
  This thing's got to be worth 50 grand.
  50 grand?! Oh, my God!
  I can finally afford that operation
  to swap my vocal cords with Patrick Stewart.
  Hey, Lois, I spent the afternoon making a list of famous Armenians.
  Eric Bogosian, Andre Agassi,
  Jerry "The Shark" Tarkanian.
  That is all.
  Peter, you've been sleeping with that money for the past week.
  Don't you think it's time we did something with it?
  Buy a bolt and shut that trap of yours?
  - What? - What?
  'Cause I had an idea.
  Remember when we first got married...
  And I said, "I wonder what it would be like to be a bear"?
  No, no, no, I'm talking about that dream we had, Peter.
  Remember? We tried to open that restaurant,
  and we never quite got it going.
  Yeah, we got shut down 'cause of my exploding cupcakes.
  Mmm, I hope these taste as good as they look.
  Gerald!
  The secret is in the frosting.
  But I'll never tell.
  Well, here's another chance to open a restaurant.
  You're right.
  - And I'll make my special cupcakes. - No, Peter...
  Oh, yeah, right, that was the problem.
  All right, everybody, only three hours till opening.
  Oh, this is going to be the coolest place in Quahog.
  All the movers and shakers and bigwigs are going to eat here...
  but not the small wigs.
  Hey, I'm hungry.
  I got a credit card.
  Oh, God, I'm so nervous. I hope it goes well.
  Oh, yes, I'm sure it will go as well as Liza Minnelli's Playboy shoot.
  Oh, God, please put your clothes back on.
  Mama... Mama...
  Do you love me now, Mama?
  Please love me, Mama!
  Good evening. Welcome to Big Pete's House of Munch.
  - May I help you? - Yes, do you accept the Discover card?
  Hey, Lois, Diamond Jim Brady over here
  just asked if we accept the Discover card.
  They're in an exclusive club called anybody.
  Yeah. No, no, no, I don't think so.
  You know, you know, I would rather take two live chickens
  than your fly-by-night credit card.
  I would rather take a jar of pennies
  that's value was less than that of your bill.
  - Look, you don't have to insult me. - No, no, no.
  You are going to sit there and listen to the funny things
  I would take instead of your credit card.
  The guy at table 7 complained there's not enough juice on his prime rib.
  Oh, did he, now?
  Let me take care of that for him.
  Tell him, bon appétit, douchebag.
  Oh, look, it's one of those early Maude episodes
  with the really long opening credit sequence.
  Lady Godiva was a freedom rider
  She didn't care if the whole world looked
  Joan of Arc with the Lord to guide her
  She was a sister who really cooked
  Madame Curie was a strong woman character
  Working all day in a science lab, yeah
  Clara Barton was a famous nurse
  Who was rapping with the soldiers and bandages, too
  Susan B. Anthony always out doin' stuff
  Marching around and holding up signs...
  And then there's Maude.
  - Pocahontas had it all goin' on - What the hell?
  An Indian guide with lots of Indian pride
  Indira Gandhi ran a whole big country
  That isn't easy even if you're a guy...
  And then there's Maude?
  - Babe Zaharias was a really good athlete - Aw, come on!
  Good at track and field and professional golf, too
  And then there's Maude!
  Amelia Earhart flew a lot of airplanes
  Except for that one time when she didn't come back
  - Cleopatra lived way out in the desert - And then there's
  Maude! Come on!
  But still found a way to keep herself looking fine
  And then there's Maude...
  There we go!
  That was an ordeal.
  Well, Peter, this has been an amazing week.
  You and I own a restaurant. Can you believe it?
  I know. I feel like I'm dreaming.
  Wait.
  Maybe I am dreaming.
  That means I can do whatever I want without consequences.
  What are you doing?
  I just adopted 30 puppies!
  You guys, I have some bad news.
  I just finished going over the books,
  and this restaurant is hemorrhaging money.
  What? Well, how is that possible?
  Isn't it obvious? We're not getting enough customers.
  This place is like a ghost town half the time.
  Yeah. Maybe somebody should have asked me.
  After all, I'm the only one in this family with any business experience.
  All right, Violet and Pigpen,
  you've been seeing each other a few weeks now. What seems to be the
  problem?
  I keep getting bladder infections, and I don't know why.
  Really?
  You don't know why?
  I don't know what to do, guys.
  The House of Munch is going down the tubes.
  Maybe you need to do a little advertising, Peter.
  Well, I tried.
  I even hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct my TV commercial.
  I have a secret to tell you.
  - What is it? - Come closer.
  I see good food at competitive prices.
  At Big Pete's House of Munch! Stop on by!
  Unfortunately, they couldn't air it,
  'cause it turns out M. Night Shyamalan was involved with September 11.
  You know, Peter, my buddies and I have been looking for a new hangout.
  Our usual doughnut shop has gotten a little...
  Puerto Ricany.
  What if we made your place our new spot?
  Joe, that's a great idea!
  Fantastic! We'll see you tonight.
  This is awesome!
  Bunch of cops in uniform hanging out in my restaurant?
  This is going to be cooler than that time
  Ben Stiller taught me how to be myself.
  But how can you leave me now, Ben Stiller,
  when I need you more than ever?
  I've taught you everything you need to know, Peter.
  Now it's time for me to go help another child.
  I guess I just fooled myself into thinking you'd always be with me.
  I will, Peter.
  I will always be with you.
  His movies are terrible...
  Lois, roll out the red carpet. Here comes Joe and his cop buddies.
  You got tables for 30?
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joe! I thought you were bringing your cop friends
  over.
  What are all these parallelograms doing here?
  You mean paraplegics. These are my friends, Peter.
  Come on, guys. Let's eat.
  Oh, God. I hope there's not one of those angry, handicapped Vietnam guys
  with the bandana on his head. Oh! There he is.
  I've seen some things, man, and some stuff.
  I wouldn't recommend it.
  Peter, isn't this wonderful? The place is packed.
  Uh... Lois, uh...
  aren't you a little freaked out by this?
  Why? Everybody's having a great time.
  Besides, think of the money we're making.
  I don't care about that. I wanted a cool restaurant,
  not the cafeteria at the veteran's hospital.
  This is weirder than that rap video by M.C. Escher.
  Going up the stairs and going down the stairs
  And going up the stairs and going down the stairs
  And going up the sideways stairs.
  And, in local news, a new restaurant is taking Quahog by storm.
  That's right, Diane. If you're handicapped,
  or know someone who's handicapped, or just happen to be a fan of the
  circus,
  then come on down to Big Pete's House of Munch,
  where the elite without feet meet to eat.
  Lois, this is insanity. I think we should shut down the restaurant.
  But... why? We're doing so well.
  Lois, let me explain something to you, all right? Cripples are not cool.
  - Hang on. I'm going to get the picture. - Oh, Peter, don't...
  - What do you see here, Lois? - Do we have to...?
  What do you see?!
  - A picture of Mark Harmon. - A picture of Mark Harmon,
  the greatest actor who ever lived.
  Do you see a wheelchair under Mark Harmon?
  - Peter... - Lois,
  do you...
  see a wheelchair...
  under Mark Harmon?
  - No. - No, you do not,
  because Mark Harmon is cool.
  I know what you're thinking. "Peter, this is just like your Gil Gerard
  speech."
  And you can stop right in your tracks, because it is not.
  Granted, it is similar to the Gil Gerard speech, but it...
  Peter, I like our restaurant the way it is,
  and if you don't, that's your problem.
  Fine. Then I'll deal with this myself.
  All right, here they come.
  Hey, Peter, we're here for dinner.
  Oh no, you're not, Joe. We have a new policy.
  Can't you read the sign?
  Peter, what the hell is that all about?
  It's a message, Joe.
  I don't want you and your kind eating here anymore.
  You're ruining what was supposed to be a cool establishment.
  Peter, you're one of my closest friends.
  Are you... you telling me that you have a problem with me being
  handicapped?
  As a matter of fact, Joe, yes. I think it's immoral.
  It's a lifestyle choice you're forcing on America.
  We handicapped are a proud people!
  Yeah, when you're not drinking and gambling on your reservations,
  which we gave you.
  Fine, if that's the way you want it,
  but we're not going to go down easy.
  Okay, that was easy.
  But I'll be back with more handicapped guys!
  Dad, look! Here they come!
  Peter, we'll give you one last chance to let us in!
  What are you going to do, Joe? I'm up here.
  And you're down there.
  Very well, Peter, you leave us no choice.
  Men, form up Crippletron!
  Help! Help! Somebody help me!
  Ben Stiller, help me.
  No, Peter. I heard what you said about my movies.
  How did you hear?
  Hello!
  Go to hell, you mutant offspring of comedy people.
  Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid he'll never walk again...
  without remembering how lucky he is
  that he'll only be in this wheelchair for two weeks.
  That leg should heal up just fine.
  Peter, you do realize you deserve this for the way you treated Joe.
  I think you owe him an apology.
  Are you kidding, Lois?
  It ain't my fault that him and all his gimpy friends
  don't fit in with regular society.
  But I'm going to be different.
  I'll be a dignified cripple, and I'll show them all how it's done!
  Don't wish it away
  Don't look at it like it's forever
  Between you and me
  I could honestly say
  That things can only get better
  And while I'm away
  Dust out the demons inside
  And it won't be long before you and me run
  To the place in our hearts
  Where we hide
  And I guess that's why they call it the blues
  And I guess that's why they call it the blues.
  Joe, uh...
  - you got a minute? - What is it, Peter?
  I, uh...
  just wanted to apologize.
  I thought you and your friends were just a bunch of gross cripples,
  but I've been in a wheelchair for 45 minutes now,
  and I see how tough it is.
  Well, Peter, it's been a rough week for both of us,
  but it means a lot to me to hear you say that.
  So what do you say? Can we put all this behind us?
  I'd like nothing better.
  Hey, Bonnie and I are watching Grey's Anatomy if you want to come in.
  Oh, boy, Joe, I... I got to tell you, that... that...
  that sounds awful.



Title: Boys Do Cry

We now return to Julia Louis-Dreyfus in "Now It's Just Getting Sad."
  Okay, okay, hear me out.
  My character is a therapist living in the city,
  but I'm married to an elephant.
  Hi, I'm the husband. Hey, honey.
  We're going to my parents' this weekend. Did you pack your trunk?
  I don't think I want to go. I don't like going to your parents.
  Why?
  Maybe because your dad's an ivory hunter?
  See, there's a lot going on here. A lot going on.
  It actually, it actually gets pretty watchable.
  Ah, damn, it's still raining.
  Lois, you mind if I go in the house?
  Fine, fine, just put the newspaper down.
  Hey, Lois, look at this.
  The church is holding auditions for a new organist.
  Really? Wow, you know, that sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
  Yeah, it's been a while since you've had the chance to play in public.
  Church organist? Ah, that's boring.
  Why don't you do something more interesting?
  Like when I had that job feeding the homeless.
  That's going to make you big and strong.
  Burping time.
  Oh, smells like someone needs to be changed.
  When was the last time you were changed, seven days ago?
  That's one week. There are seven days in a week.
  I love you, filthy hobo.
  Huh, huh! All right.
  Why do you say "organist" if you don't want...
  I don't understand the world anymore.
  Here be a jaunty sea chantey from me boyhood.
  You shake me nerves and you rattle me brain
  Too much love drives a man insane
  You broke me will, oh, what a thrill
  Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.
  I know what boys like
  I know what guys want
  I know what boys like
  Boys like
  Boys like me.
  All right, up next is Lois Griffin.
  Well, I don't know if I can compete with the rest of these people,
  but here goes.
  My word, what a fascinating man this Jesus must have been.
  I can just imagine meeting him.
  That was beautiful,Mrs. Griffin.
  Up next is Jake Tucker.
  Well, finally! Some of us have been waiting all evening for a certain
  wife
  to come home and feed her starving family.
  Peter, I told you I was going to be late. Couldn't you have handled
  dinner?
  You can't ask me to make dinner, Lois.
  That's like asking me to choose between Sarah Jessica Parker
  and Kirsten Dunst in a hotbody/weird face contest.
  It can't be done.
  Well, I've got good news.
  I'm going to be the church's new organist.
  - Hey, congrats. - Wow, Mom, that's great.
  That means you'll play the organ.
  It also means that this family is going to start going to church again
  on Sundays.
  Being there today reminded me
  of how important religious services are to the moral fiber of a family.
  And lately, this family has been lacking moral fiber.
  Especially you, Meg.
  Meg, what happened to you?
  She can't answer you.
  She can't even talk.
  Ever since she started smoking pot, she just kind of lays there.
  It's really sad.
  And a tiny bit funny.
  Oh, my God, I think I'm getting a contact high.
  Oh, now I'm messed up, too.
  Good morning, everyone.
  A reading from the letter of John to the couple with the crying baby
  upstairs.
"Obviously you hearyour kid crying
"and you're trying to break him of some habit.
"But I got news for you.
"It's not working.
"I swear to God if it doesn't stop,
I will come up thereand show him what real pain is."
The Word of the Lord.
Praise be to God.
Oh, I am so hungry.
Oh, look, they're handingout cookies up there.
Stewie, wait, don't...
Hey, there. Eat up, y'all.
Youse is good church going folk. Y'all deserve a little treat.
Give me that!
Well, aren't you an enthusiastic wafer muncher.
- What is that, punch? - Oh, don't y'all drink that.
Youse gonna get sick.
Yep.
- That baby just threw up the host! - That's a sign of the devil.
- Oh, my God,is he possessed? - He's possessed!
That baby is possessed by Satan!
Calm down, everyone. He's just a little sick.
I'll take him home.Come on, sweetie.
Oh, sweet, weare out of here.
Now I can do what I planned to do this morning...
Gladiator mice.
Yes, yes, die, die, die!
I have everything,and you have nothing!
Ugh, what a horrible morning.
You know, all I wanted was for us to share a simple Sunday church
  service as a family.
  But I guess that's too much to ask.
  Good afternoon, Mrs. Griffin.
  We're here to take custody of your baby so that the good reverend here
  can perform an exorcism and banish the devil from his infant soul.
  What?! You are not performing an exorcism on my baby.
  Mrs. Griffin,you can give him to us, or we can take him by force.
  - No! - Don't worry, Lois,
  we'll hide in the one place they can't find us.
  In Imagination Land,
  where you burp where you fart, and you fart where you burp.
  Indeed, that's how it happens.
  Where are we going?
  Who cares as long as it's away from those bloody church fanatics.
  We're going to Texas.
  We can stay at my sister Carol's place until this blows over.
  Texas? We're going to Texas in search of religious tolerance?
  That's going to be like trying to get Sneakers O'Toole to take his
  sneakers off.
  I'm not taking my sneakers off I am Sneakers O'Toole.
  Hey, take those sneakers off.
  - No! - Take them off, I said!
  No!
  Ah, let him go. We'll never catch him.
  Not in these shoes.
  I'm not taking my sneakers off I am Sneakers O'Toole.
  - Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. - And I'm Diane Simmons.
  Authorities are on the look out for one-year-old Stewie Griffin,
  a Quahog infant who is believed to be possessed by Satan.
  A substantial reward is being offered for any information leading to
  his capture.
  In other pseudo-scientific news, a local man claims to have spotted
  bigfoot.
  We've got the exclusive interview.
  I was about to bone my girlfriend out at the lake,
  but suddenly she yelled,
  so I looked up and it was bigfoot.
  - So what happened next? - Then I went back to bone her,
  but the mosquitoes were going crazy, and she said there was no way.
  All right, get your snacks and hurry out, you guys.
  Yeah, look, they have Chunky bars.
  What a God-awful mess those things are, chocolate with raisins in it.
  Yeah, yeah, that's what kids want with their chocolate-- fruit.
  Why don't you put sunflower seeds in the Ding Dongs while you're at it?
  - Is that part of your stand-up act? - I don't know, do you like it?
  I wouldn't open with it.
  Pardon me, sir. We're trying to locate a possessed child.
  Have you seen anyone who looks like this?
  Yeah, that's my son.
  He's actually inthe mini-mart right now. He'll be out in a second.
  I-I-I-I mean, I mean no, no. Never seen him before.
  Hmm. What was that first thing you said?
  Oh, I was just saying that baby in the picture is my son.
  He's traveling with us. He's part of our family.
  We're trying to avoid being found by police like you.
  I mean, I was just remarking what a nice tie you have on.
  I love this tie.
  All right, you folks take care now.
  Oh, did you hear that cashier's accent?
"Would you like some change please for you?"
Oh, you know, if it weren't for 9/11, those guys would be adorable.
Oh, my God, look.
Quick, into the bathroom.
We're going to have to come up with a way to change your appearance.
Well, I could disguise myself as Britney Spears.
I'm already standing in urine, and I hate the person I'm with.
No, see, there's got to be something in here we can use.
Boy, that was a close one back there.
Way to think on your feet, Brian.
We got lucky. How you holding up, Stewie?
Um... I feel right, Brian.
I feel right.
Are you sure Aunt Carol won't mind us using her house?
She won't care, Chris. She's off on her ninth honeymoon.
When will it work for her?
Howdy, new neighbors.
- Pleased to welcome you. - We're the Lynches.
We live next door.
Nice to meet you. We're the Griffins.
Nellie here is a homemaker. And I'm a queer chaser and beater.
Lois, I'm not sure this is the right place for us.
These Texans are socially backward and,
politically, they're all stubborn as a mule.
Nope, sorry, Kevin Bacon wasn't in Footloose.
- What ? Of course he was. - No, he wasn't. You lose.
- Of course he was, he was the star. - No, you're wrong. Look it up.
I don't have to look it up. It's common knowledge.
- He was on the cover of...Nope. - Nope.
- People magazine when the movie... - Nope. No. No.
- Everyone knows Kevin Bacon - No, no, No, No!
- was the star of Footloose. - No! No! No!
No! No! No! No! Hyan! Hyan!
Look what the Lynches gave us.
A needle point of Chuck Norris from Walker, Texas Ranger.
You know, they say Chuck Norris is so tough there's no chin under his
  beard.
  - There is only another fist. - That's ridiculous.
  Chuck Norris ?
  You know, this place may be the upside to everything that's happened.
  The people are kind and generous. They seem whole some and moral.
  Exactly the kind of influence this family needs.
  Lois, we're living in a red state with a bunch of right-wing nutjobs.
  Hey, Chris, check out my belt buckle.
  It says, "Everything's bigger in Texas."
  Belts are a great way to express opinions.
  This is Channel Five News, Texas, with Duke Dillon.
  Howdy, Texas. I'm Duke Dillon.
  At the top of the news tonight,
  authorities have called off their pursuit of a fugitive Rhode Island
  baby
  who was thought to be possessed by the devil.
  Oh! Thank God!
  This turn of events came after Vatican scientists
  announced today that the devil is not the greatest threat to salvation
  due to last week's discovery of the Superdevil.
  Religion reporter Dallas Houston has the story.
  Thanks, Duke.
  Well, let me try and give you a clear picture of what we're dealing
  with here.
  Here's a photo of the devil, and here's the Superdevil.
  Now, as you can see, there are some significant differences.
  The Superdevil is at least six inches taller,
  he has a flying motorcycle and a jar of marmalade
  that we believe forces you to commit adultery.
  Thanks a lot, Dallas.
  Looks like we all got something new to be afraid of.
  Everyone, it's over!
  We can go back to Quahog.
  Hey, Lois, you say something?
  Aw, just that I think you're going to love this cake.
  None for me, thanks. It's going to go straight to my vagina.
  That's what girls worry about, right, having big vaginas?
  Dad, why aren't you taking the car?
  Chris, we're in Texas now. If I'm not riding a horse,
  I'm going to stick out like a straight guy in a figure-skating
  competition.
  Boo-ya! Triple salchow in your face!
  Hey, you want this? Huh? You want some of this?
  Oh, man, look at your rack.
  I'd motorboat that. I'd motorboat the hell out of it!
  Right after this layback spin.
  Bottle of Jack Daniels, please.
  - There you go. - Thanks.
  What's this?
  That's your gun. Buy some liquor,get a free gun.
  Is that like a special you have on now or something?
  Nope. Texas state law.
  You have a nice day now.
  State law?
  God! This place officially sucks worse than the WNBA.
  And, at the top of the second half, it's 16 to nine.
  Easton leads the scoring with four.
  And that's why she commands $7,000 a year.
  These gals sure do make it look difficult.
  But is having this minor skill worth being so unattractive?
  That's for the fan to decide.
  Yay!
  Huh. That was kind of cool.
  Been a long day, Lois. Long day.
  Peter, what the hell?
  You can't bring that horse into our bed.
  Lois, I cannot believe you would ban the horse from our bed.
  He is a graceful, majestic creature who is a part of this family
  and only wants you to love and respect... The horse may have pooped in
  the bed.
  I hereby call this meeting of the Texas Youth Club to order.
  First, I'd like to welcome our two newcomers,
  Chris and Meg Griffin.
  Wow! This is the coolest club I've ever been in.
  Well, you're not quite in the club yet.
  You got to pass the initiation.
  What do we have to do?
  You got to sneak on to the Crawford Ranch
  and steal a pair of George Bush's underwear.
  And then bring it back here so we can bask inits Bushy goodness.
  Boy, that's even kinkier than the porn they make for senior citizens.
  Can I help you, Edward?
  Yeah. I'm here for the early bird special.
  - Are those new slacks? - What's that, now?
  - Are those new slacks? - I got these on special at Caldors.
  - Who drove you there? - My nephew.
  Oh. That was nice of him.
  I forgot why I came over.
  Are those new slacks?
  What is this? What the hell are we doing here?
  Welcome to your first toddler pageant, Stewie.
  It's what you do when you're in Texas.
  Oh, lovely.
  A first-class ticket to a semen-stained death in the basement.
  Why don't you meet the other contestants while I go register you?
  Hello. I'm, uh... Stephanie Griffin.
  - Hi, Stephanie. - What's your talent?
  I sing, I do gymnastics, and I can play seven instruments at the same
  time.
  Hmm. You could be a threat to me.
  Chuck.
  There it is... the Crawford Ranch.
  I can't believe we're actually doing this.
  What a bonding adventure for the two of us.
  Settle down, Meg.
  Okay, I see Old Man Cheney guarding the place.
  18% approval ratings.
  I'll give you 18% of my foot in your ass.
  I'd like you to meet my daughter's husband Michael.
  Wow! Look how organized he is.
  He's already got his sugar cut up into neat little lines for his
  breakfast tomorrow.
  And a razor blade to shave.
  Wow! Look at this.
  I can't believe Mrs. Bush kept all these Planned Parenthood receipts.
  Holy cow! She's been scraped more times than a fisherman's knuckle.
  Hey, what are you kids doing here?
  You tell Javier to back off. I'll have his money by next week.
  - What? - Nevermind
  Hey, you guys want to see something?
  Grab a beer and follow me.
  See this car? I restored it myself this summer.
  I was here for 12 weeks. I had to do something.
  But, along the way, I learned about honesty, integrity,
  and cold filtered Miller Genuine Draft.
  That's an adult beverage right there.
  You understand what I'm trying to say to you?
  Yes. But I have just one question.
  Can I borrow your underpants for ten minutes?
  Hello.
  - Oh. Hi, Jillian. - Brian, I'm reading TV Guide.
  Can you explain how these cheers and jeers work again?
  Well, the cheers is when they generally approve of something on
  television,
  and jeers is when they find some sort of fault with it.
  Oh. See... yeah, I'm not quite...
  We can't do this over the phone.
  You're going to have to come over.
  I can't come over. We're still on the run because the town thinks
  Stewie's possessed.
  No, they don't. Didn't you hear? They stopped chasing you weeks ago.
  - What? I have to go. - Wait, wait! I have another question.
  How do I know if I'm Jewish?
  - Are you Jewish? - No
  - There you go, sport. - Thank you.
  Hey, guys, thanks so much for inviting me out today.
  I'm psyched to brand my first cow.
  Here you are, Peter. All fired up and ready to go.
  Oh...!
  Oh, yes!
  Yes! Oh...!
  Oh, hang on a second.
  Man, Texas is great.
  Back where I'm from, a retarded guy could never have this much fun.
  - What did you just say? - What?
  Technically, I'm retarded.
  Fellas! Fellas! Can't we talk this over?
  Talking is for terrorists and blacks.
  In Texas, we execute the retarded.
  Oh, my God! So this is how it ends?
  I always thought I'd die having to sit through the Canadian Film
  Festival.
  I don't wish to cause you any harm,
  and I won't.
  The end.
  Horsey, you saved my life.
  No problem, Peter. Glad to help out.
  Wow! Gilbert Gottfried.
  - That's right! - Awesome.
  Now the final contestant for our talent portion of the competition,
  Stephanie Griffin.
  Thank you, thank you.
  Hey, what's the deal with Chunky bars, huh?
  Chocolate with raisins in it?
  Yeah, that's what kids want with their chocolate-- fruit.
  Wow, that bit is killing.
  Hey, Lois, great news. We can go back to Quahog.
  I know, Brian. Shh! We're about to see if Stewie won.
  Wait a minute. You know?
  - How long have you known? - A few weeks. Who cares?
  Wait a minute. You... you've known for weeks,
  and you've been lying about having to stay here?
  Brian, don't you see?
  This is a wholesome community with real values.
  And our firstrunner-up is...
  Miss Dixie-Ann Thomas.
  Which means that Miss Stephanie Griffin is our new Little Miss Texas!
  Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, I never expected this.
  Oh, I'm so, so honored.
  Hey, that's not a girl!
  It's Enrico Palazzo!
  No, it's not!It's one of them queerosexuals!
  Get him!
  Quick! Get on!
  - Thank you for all your help. - My pleasure, Peter. Anytime.
  Oh, fantastic. Hey, do you still do stand-up?
  - I do. I'm still touring. - Oh, wow. Can we get tickets?
  Absolutely. I'm in Atlanta next week.
  Great. Oh, well,this will be fun.
  It is so good to be home.
  You know, I wanted us to live in a place with real family values.
  But values don't come from where you live or who your friends are.
  They come from inside, from your own beliefs.
  I agree, Lois. Like, for instance,
  if you're watching a TV show and you decide to take your values from
  that,
  you're an idiot.
  Maybe you should take responsibility for what values your kids are
  getting.
  Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids watch certain shows in the
  first place
  if you have such a big problem with them, instead of blaming the shows
  themselves.
  Yeah



Title: No Chris Left Behind

We now return to How I Met Your Father.
  Oh, Barney, I'm never going to meet the right girl and get married.
  You know, Ted, don't you think it's kinda strange for a guy in his 20s
  to always be talking about getting married rather than getting laid?
  Barney,
  I'm in love with you.
  Suit up.
  All right, come on, everyone. Go get dressed. It's ballet night.
  Lois, don't freakin' put me through this again.
  Peter, a little culture is good for this family.
  Besides, you liked The Nutcracker, didn't you?
  No, Lois, I did not.
  The Nutcracker had zero physical comedy.
  And with a name like The Nutcracker I thought,
"Oh, this will be worth a few yuks," but no, Lois,
that title wrote a check that those queers on stage refused to cash.
Peter, we're going.
Well, we're not the first people to be dragged off against our will.
- Are we there yet? - No!
- Are we there yet? - No!
Are we there yet?
Damn it! I swear to God I will turn this ship around!
- That works. - It'll teach us a lesson. - Yeah, that's even better.
All right, if that's what you... Wait a minute!
You know, Meg, female ballet dancers are famous for anorexia and
  bulimia.
  And, uh, it seems to work out for them, so...
  hintity, hint-hint.
  Boy, this is gonna be long.
  So, uh, you kids develop any good pot connections at your school yet?
  - What? - Yeah. - Ah.
  Lois, we'll be right back. Meg's gonna take me outside to poop.
  Hello.
  Hey, Quagmire.
  Hey, Peter, what's up?
  I'm stuck at the stupid ballet.
  Get out of here. You serious?
  - Yeah. - So am I.
  What?
  Yeah, I got dragged here by this broad I'm trying to screw.
  Where you sitting?
  Look across at the other balcony. I can see you.
  Oh, my God! What do we do?! What do we do?! We're both here.
  Oh, my God! We should text each other! Hang up! Hang up!
  Chris, how many times have I told you no reading during meals?
  I have a history test today, Mom,
  and I couldn't study last night because you made us go to the ballet.
  Well, Chris, you're not gonna learn any history from this. This
  textbook is from 1948.
  - What? - Chapter 3:
"Youth culture rebels with Big Band music."
Let me see that.
"Israel, the brand-new country everyone's gonna love."
What the hell? Are the schools so underfunded
that they can't afford text books from this century?
Well, I am going to raise hell about this at the next PTA meeting.
Well, let me know if you need help. I can be very persuasive.
I gave the next speech after the Braveheart guy.
They can take our lives, but they can never take
our freedom!
And... and...
Let's not forget the tax they levied on properties
that are in abutment of church lands.
So, yeah, let's do it.
All right, let's get this meeting underway.
For our first order of business, we'll go to Bruce.
Well, hey, y'all said my name.
Welcome to our meeting here at the school.
We got lots of exciting topics here tonight.
We gonna have a puppet show. We gonna have some jazz.
No, I'm just kidding.
We have some business to take care of, though.
I'm sorry I pulled y'all's legs.
I'm just a little excited 'cause I met somebody today.
Someone in the bookstore.
Someone who likes the same kind of literature as I do.
Oh, and the adventure begins again.
Excuse me, Principal Shepherd
There's something I'd like to discuss.
The school has gone too far with these budget cuts.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but the "No Child Left Behind" law
cost us our federal funding because our students' test scores were too
  low.
  They cut a school's funding if it's got low test scores?
  This is not what the founding fathers had in mind.
  Okay, we're here to sign this declaration of our independence.
  Let's take roll call first.
  - Thomas Jefferson? - Here.
  - Benjamin Franklin. - Here.
  - John Footpenis? - It's Hancock now.
  - Why? - Mind your business. That's why.
  Well, somehow this school needs to raise its test scores right away.
  I suppose there is one thing I can do to raise the school's test
  average.
  Then do it.
  All right, we'll drop the dumbest student we have:
  Chris Griffin is hereby expelled.
  But if I leave now, I won't hear who's the dumbest kid in the school.
  Cool, I don't have to go to school.
  I can just pee in my bed all day.
  Chris, being expelled is a serious thing.
  Peter, we've got to find another school for him.
  I say, I could home-school him.
  After all, I taught Cleveland how to make Jiffy Pop.
  So do you think your school would be right for Chris?
  Oh, absolutely.
  Quahog School for the Deaf has great programs,
  both academic and athletic.
  In fact, you're just in time for our homecoming pep rally.
  What are we gonna do to Lincoln?!
  Kill them!
  I can't hear you!
  Kill them!
  I can't hear you!
  Kill them!
  I can't hear you!
  Kill them!
  I can't hear you!
  Kill them!
  Let's just go.
  Welcome to the Quahog Maritime School, Chris.
  Our curriculum consists of being on boats
  for long periods of time with men, just men for many days at a time.
  Up on the deck with lots of men or down in the galley with lots of men.
  Is this some kind of pirate school?
  Well, a certain kind of pirate. Yes, we've been called that.
  I don't know.
  Is there some kind of preschool program?
  You know, I have to admit I've always been a little worried about
  Chris, but
  I guess I just convinced myself things would work out for him,
  but with no education, what kind of future can he possibly have?
  What are we supposed to do, Lois?
  I mean, it's not like the high school will take him back.
  And every other school we've tried just doesn't...
  Oh, crap!
  My son got into DeVry.
  Ah, good. What'd he have to do,open the door?
  Can't you let me have anything?
  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on. Hang on.
  What are we fighting about?
  You know, I have completely forgotten.
  - Me, too. - Something about a coupon. It's all...
  - I cannot for the life of me remember. - Oh, my God, that's ridiculous.
  You know what? I-I just... I hope I didn't hurt you.
  No, no, no. I... I'm all right. I'm all right..
  But listen, you know what? Let me make it up to you.
  Why don't you let my wife and I take you out to dinner?
  Well, that sounds lovely.
  Uh, that was delicious.
  You know, I drive by this place all the time
  and I've never been inside; isn't that funny?
  Y-Yeah, you know, Nicole and I came here by accident.
  W-We had reservations at another place and they... right, right, honey?
  Yeah, they couldn't seat us for like an hour, so we ended up coming here
  - and we just loved it. - Loved it.
  I can see why. I mean, th-that halibut was...
  that, may have been the best halibut I've ever had.
  Well, glad we talked you out of the pork chops, huh?
  Yes! Thank you!
  Oh, oh, oh, lemme, lemme,let me... I-I'll get that.
  Oh, no, no, no,no, no, I got it.
  No, no, no, no, no. I'm taking care of this.
  No, no, no, your money's no good here.
  My food was more expensive. I feel bad. If I...
  We invited you. I've got this.
  - Look, just let goof the check, huh. - You let go of the check.
  - I'm not taking my hand off this thing. - Well, neither am I.
  Let go of the check.
  - Ernie, if he wants to... - Stay out of this!
  Don't you talk to my wife like that!
  Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it?
  Sorry.
  And every other school we've tried just doesn't seem to be a good fit
  for Chris.
  Well, there is one other option.
  Daddy, there's something I need you to do for me.
  Chris got expelled from James Woods High, and,
  well, I was wondering if you could get him into that fancy boarding
  school you went to.
  You want me to get Chris into Morningwood Academy?
  It would mean so much to our family.
  All right, I'll pull some strings on one condition:
  I want Peter to do something really humiliating.
  Well, what did you have in mind?
  He has to shoot and starin' a shot-for-shot remake of Liar, Liar for my
  amusement.
  Do you know why I stopped you?
  I didn't fasten my seat belt. I didn't look in my rear view mirror.
  I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb. I almost hit a Chevy.
  I changed lanes in the intersection without signaling.
  I changed lanes while running a red light and speeding!
  Well, Chris, here we are.
  Wow, this school is really nice.
  Boy, a degree from here would set you up with any job you wanted.
  Yes, I should attend this institution.
  Perhaps one day I could be more powerful than King Friday.
  I am the supreme ruler of the Neighborhood of Make Believe.
  All will kneel before my...
  What kind of freakin' king lives next to the train tracks?
  What is this, Mexico?
  Hi. Is this room 214?
  Oh, you must be our new dorm mate. I'm Rogers Chapstick,
  heir to the Chapstick fortune.
  And this is Virgil MasterCard, heir to the MasterCard fortune.
  Oh, yes, yes,how do you do, sirrrr?
  And this is James Bottomtooth, IV.
  - Uh... I'm Chris. - Let me get those bags for you. Johann?
  Um, oh, dear. Johann tells me your luggage is the luggage of the poor.
  Well... I am poor.
  Oh.
  Oh, I see.
  What the...?
  This school is not for your kind!
  Why?!
  I still don't fully understand!
  ...and that was the third time I slept with Katherine Harris.
  Well, I love her politics, but how is she in bed?
  Well, as anyone in Florida will tell you, she knows how to rig an
  erection.
  One time I picked my nose and I swear I could feel the bottom of my eye.
  - Shut up, poor kid. - No, I'm serious. Look!
  So, Chris, how's the new school?
  It's awful. I hate it!
  Everybody's mean to me because I'm not rich.
  Oh, no, Chris, that's horrible.
  All right, look,I'll tell you what.
  I'll call Daddy and I'll see if there's anything he can do.
  Well, that's enough fun for one day.
  I'm sweating more than a non-legacy applying to Yale.
  Where am I?
  Grandpa?
  What are you doing here?
  Chris, welcome to the Skull and Bones Society.
  This is where the most powerful men in the world are groomed for their
  futures.
  Every president, every CEO, every douchebag named Ryan Seacrest.
  The Skull and Bones Society has been a part of my family for decades,
  and we want you to become a member.
  Really? Wow, cool!
  Excellent. You get your own stock portfolio,
  a percentage of the 9/11 Victims' Fund,
  And the best medical care on the planet.
  You'll be kept as healthy as a horse.
  - So, how's that leg doing? - Great. Great. Never better.
  Good. Why don't you try putting some weight on it?
  Eh, sure.
  Yes! Yes! Oh, that's good.
  That feels good. Very strong.
  Sorry, Thunder, I gotta put you down.
  How's your leg, huh?!
  How's your leg?! You ready to race?!
  We now return to Japanese Girls
  Think Small Versions of Things Are Really Cute.
  Oh, look at my tiny dog. I'm gonna put it in my tiny purse.
  Tiny phone!
  Tiny everything!
  Peter, have you seen this tuition bill?
  Morningwood Academy is charging us $30,000.
  Well, looks like we're all gonna have to take second jobs.
  I guess I'll see if I can get my old gig back selling buttscratchers at
  the ballpark.
  Buttscratcher! Buttscratcher! Get your buttscratcher here!
  - Buttscratcher! - Buttscratcher.
  - Buttscratcher! - Buttscratcher!
  Buttscratcher!
  - Buttscratcher! - Buttscratcher!
  Chris, come here. You'll love this.
  The first Thursday of every month
  we go to a local orphanage, pick out a kid, fill out all the paperwork
  and then don't take him home. It's hilarious.
  That sounds kind of cruel.
  No, no, you'll love it.It's great.
  Come on. Come on in. Your family's waiting in here.
  There are toys. And a puppy.
  And food that's not served from warming trays.
  Come on.You gotta want it.
  Ah, you gotta do better than that.
  Okay, I guess you don't want a new family, toys, and a puppy.
  Hi, everybody, I'm home.
  - Hi, Chris. - Hello.Hey, how are you?
  Well, tell us everything,sweetie.
  How's school going so far?
  It's great, Mom.
  I got powerful connections now, thanks to Grandpa.
  Chris, I'd give you a hug, but I'm exhausted from working two jobs to
  pay your tuition.
  I've been selling buttscratchers.
  - Buttscratcher! - No, Peter.
  - Buttscratcher! - Peter, no.
  - Buttscratcher! - No!
  Buttscratcher...
  Dad, you...
  You got an extra job just to put me through school?
  We all did, Chris.
  Meg and I have been working nights.
  I'll take the one on the right.
  Well, once again, Meg, I'll be back in an hour.
  And I got a job following fat people around with a tuba.
  Stop it.
  Cut it out
  I have a glandular problem.
  That'll be $60.
  You wanted to see me, Grandpa?
  Yes, Chris. Your pledge period is over.
  The Skull and Bones elders are now ready to admit you to our ranks.
  As is customary with all our new members,
  you now have to spend seven minutes in the closet with our most senior
  member.
  We don't start the clock until the door closes.
  You know, Grandpa, I don't think I want to go through with it.
  We all had to do it, Chris. Now get in there.
  No, I mean, I think I want to go back to my old school.
  My family's working so hard to pay my tuition here, and I feel bad.
  Is there any way you can get me back into James Woods High?
  Well, I suppose I could pull some strings
  if that's really what you want, Chris.
  It is.
  All right,consider it done.
  Thanks, Grandpa.
  Sorry, Master Herbert.
  Sorry? You better get your ass in that closet, Pewterschmidt.
  Yes, sir.
  I am so tired of you.
  Ah, it's good to have you back, buddy.
  Thanks, Dad.
  I didn't really fit in there anyway. The rooms were only 15x20.
  If I didn't learn to laugh at myself, I'd be dead right now.
  Why don't you take your stuff up to your room, Chris?
  Okay, Mom.
  Cut it out.
  I'm just trying to live my life.
  No one taught me about carbs.



Title: It Takes a Village Idiot and I Married One

Mom, are we there yet?
  Almost, Chris.
  Now remember, kids, when we get to Mr. Quagmire's cabin, don't touch
  anything
  before I have a chance to disinfect it.
  Boy, it was nice of Quagmire to let us use his place.
  This'll be much better than that vacation we took with the Price Is
  Right yodeler.
  Okay, you can stop here.
  There's no way that microwave cost more than 300 bucks.
  Stop here. Don't listen to that fat tourist.
  She doesn't know how much a microwave costs. Stop!
  Ah, we should have gone to Plinko like Cleveland.
  Oh... Wow, Quagmire's got a nice place.
  Ah... This is gonna be a relaxing weekend.
  Hey, did you hear something?
  I think it came from upstairs.
  Oh...
  Hey.
  Uh...
  This the week you guys were coming up?
  Beautiful country, isn't it, Chris?
  God, it is peaceful, no question, Dad.
  Just be careful 'cause they got a lot of big ol' wilderness bugs out
  here.
  Oh, hey.
  Y'all best be careful or I'm gonna sting you with my stinger.
  Oh, no!
  But then I's gonna die if I sting you.
  You know what? I'm not gonna sting y'all after all.
  And that's my choice. Y'all ain't worth it.
  I'm just gonna head on over to that flower
  and suck on that stamen like there's no tomorrow.
  Brian, how many years have I been saying you and I should go
  berry-picking?
  A lot of years, Stewie.
  Wait a minute. Do you know where we are, Brian?
  This is a very special place.
  They say once every hundred years in this spot,
  Donny Most rises from the mist.
  I think that's just a legend.
  That's because you're...
  Look!
  Donny Most, Donny Most
  He was Ralph on Happy Days.
  Donny Most, Donny Most
  Now he rises from the haze.
  Actually,it's Don Most now.
  Donny Most, Donny Most
  Sunday, Monday Happy...
  Days.
  All right,here's a little tune inspired by
  one of the great legends of the Old West.
  Well, there once were two cowboys all alone out on the trail.
  And they discovered they could sleep with another male.
  Now they're having gay sex.
  Cowboy gay sex.
  Sodomy-ee...
  Come on, everybody.
  Sodomy-ee...
  Sodomy-ee.
  Sodomy.
  And when he woke up in the morning, she was still in his bed!
  - That's it? - Yeah.
  And then she wanted to make him eggs.
  And he said, "Oh,I don't have time." I've got a meeting at 12:30."
  And she said, "I'll drive you there."
  And he said, "No, no,it's at my office.
  It's, like,a half-hour commute." And she said,
"I don't mind. It's on the way to my kid's preschool."
Hey, hey, Lois,look at me. I got post partum depression.
Wah! I'm sad about stuff! Wah!
You son of a bitch, don't even joke about that!
This water feels kind of funny.
Yeah, and it smells bad.
Dad, look!
Holy crap!
Oh, my God, what the hell is wrong with this lake?!
I think it's a safe bet that that's responsible.
So they can just dump their waste into the lake?
This can't be legal.
What kind of world is this where you can't even trust the oil companies
  anymore.
  - Hey, you've got a tattoo. - No, I don't.
  - Is that Ziggy? - No.
  - You have a Ziggy tattoo? - Aw, geez.
  - Why do you have a Ziggy tattoo? - I just used to think...
  he was kind of funny. We should, uh, we should get to the hospital.
  Mom, how long do we have to wear these wigs?
  Until our hair grows back, Chris.
  Dad, you couldn't have gotten us anything more stylish?
  Oh, I don't think it's so bad. I feel rather like Mozart.
  Hey, Stewie, play Haydn.
  Now play Handel.
  Play Peter Griffin.
  Ah, now that is a challenge.
  Go ahead, mock me.
  But it wasn't Stewie who was laughing at me.
  It was God.
  What can I do for you, Mrs. Griffin?
  Mayor West, I'm here as an outraged citizen.
  The Quahog Oil Refinery is emptying all their toxic waste into the lake.
  I mean, you couldn't possibly have sanctioned
  that kind of blatant industrial pollution, could you?
  Yeah, I told 'em it was fine.
  What?
  And in return, I get free oil for my hair.
  Hey, baby, want to take a gander at some Adam West penis?
  This is unbelievable!
  Well, I am not gonna stand by while you let this town be destroyed by
  corruption.
  Mr. Mayor, I promise you this:
  Next election,I'm gonna run against you
  and I'm gonna win.
  All right ,Mrs. Griffin, you want to take me on? Fine.
  But if you plan to beat me, you'll have to...
  What is it?
  A bee just flew in through the window.
  Don't move.
  Hmm, now look who's mayor.
  First order of business, free honey for everyone.
  Yay, Mayor Bee, Mayor Bee! Mayor Bee! Ow!
  Oh, done stung myself.
  Bye, world.
  - Good evening, Quahog. I'm Tom Tucker. - And I'm Diane Simmons.
  The Quahog mayoral race is heating up.
  With incumbent Adam West squaring off against challenger Lois Griffin.
  Which leads many political analysts to ask the question,
"Can a woman really be mayor,
or will she just menstruate all over the city?" Stay with us.
Oh, you guys,I can't tell you how much I appreciate all your hard work.
It's really gonna make a difference with my campaign.
Hey, Lois, take a look. I just made 500 T-shirts that say...
Vote for Lois, unless you're queer.
No, wait, even if you're queer.
No Jews, though.
Okay, Jews.
Oh... These are wonderful, sweetie.
Chris, why don't you put these upstairs in your closet so we don't lose
  them?
  But the evil monkey lives in my closet.
  Of course, he hasn't been as evil since he became a Jehovah's Witness.
  Hi, I'm going door-to-door to campaign on behalf of Lois Griffin
  who's offering real change for the city of Quahog.
  May we count on your vote next Tuesday?
  Chris, this is our house.
  Ah, then what is for dinner?
  - Pork chops. - Excellent.
  - Chris, have you been to any other houses? - I have not.
  - Would you like to come in? - Please.
  This is Tom Tucker with some breaking election coverage.
  Mayor Adam West has widened his lead over challenger Lois Griffin.
  I'm confident that the people of Quahog will make the right choice.
  And here to help me secure the Latino vote is actor Jimmy Smits.
  Adam West likes to eat food that's grilled in foil.
  That's our guy.
  Boy, this election's gonna be a tight one.
  It's probably gonna be decided by just a couple of votes.
  And here we are sitting here like a bunch of lazy, paraplegic cops.
  - Huh? - I'm sorry, Joe. It's just an expression.
  - Ah. - We got to give Lois a last-minute edge.
  Guys, I need you to help out on the campaign.
  Oh, man, that's like making all, like, signs, and walking around or
  what?
  You know, you bastards got a stake in this, too.
  I mean, Lois is my wife, and if she's the mayor
  we can pretty much do whatever the hell we want.
  I could do cocaine if I wanted to.
  - Peter, you want some potatoes? - Yeah, how you doin'?
  I was just asking if you wanted...
  We got enough napkins? Yeah, we got enough napkins.
  That's enough. That's enough right there.
  What time is it?
  Is this-Is this straight? Is this straight right there?
  Look, wait, see... I'll fix it.
  No, no... Is this straight? I can't tell...
  Meg, sweep that up. Get-Get a broom, sweep that up.
  Sweep that up. Put it in your room, but sweep it up first.
  Suspect number two, he's the one who raped me.
  All right, all but number two are free to leave.
  Ma'am, I know that you're going through a difficult time right now,
  but I just have a few more questions.
  - Are you planning to vote tomorrow? - What?
  Are you aware that Lois Griffin has a plan
  to cut property tax in half over the next three years?
  What does that have to do with what happened to me?
  Well, you say number two did it,
  maybe I say I smell alcohol on your breath.
  You can't do that!
  Sounds like Lois Griffin can count on your vote.
  Hi. When you go to vote for mayor tomorrow, please vote for Lois
  Griffin.
  That's right. I work at a deli and I know baloney.
  And that's exactly what you'll get with Mayor Adam West.
  Ooh, sa-nap!
  Boy, you guys,I really appreciate all the help you've been giving us.
  Except for you, Quagmire, you ain't done nothing.
  What the hell are you talking about?
  Lois is gonna get the entire female vote 'cause of me.
  I've been having sex with every woman in town nonstop for the past two
  days.
  You know how many sperm I got left? One.
  He's all alone in there and he's scared, all right?
  - He's scared. - Ah.
  Welcome, Quahog, to the town hall mayoral debate
  between incumbent Adam West and challenger Lois Griffin.
  We will now open up the floor to questions from a community at large.
  Yes, Mrs. Griffin, how do you feel about those computer websites
  that put a blue square on the home of a sex offender?
  Well, the safety of our children is a very important part of my plan
  for Quahog.
  I have a 12-point program for the security of...
  I'm sorry, your time is up.
  No, no, no, no,I'm not impressed. I'm not impressed, not yet.
  Mayor West, if reelected,
  would you increase the frequency of garbage pickup?
  Well, citizen, that's an excellent question and I thank you for it.
  I think it's great we live in a town where you can ask questions.
  Because without questions, we'd just have answers.
  And an answer without a question is a statement.
  Oh, I like him. He looks me in the eye.
  I'd like to have a beer with him. I'm voting for him.
  I don't understand these people.
  He didn't even say anything and they're eating it up.
  Lois, undecided voters are the biggest idiots on the planet.
  Try giving short, simple answers.
  Sir, your question, please?
  Mrs. Griffin, what do you plan to do about crime in our city?
  - A lot. - She's got my vote.
  Because that's what Jesus wants.
  9/11 was bad.
  I agree with that.
  God, I can't believe how easy this is.
  Mrs. Griffin, what are your plans for cleaning up our environment?
  9/11.
  Mrs. Griffin, what about our traffic problem?
  Nine...
  Eleven.
  Well, the election results are poring in and it looks like it's gonna
  be a tight one.
  Which reminds me, Diane, when's the last time you... aw, forget it.
  Oh, my God,I'm an absolute wreck.
  Well, folks, this is it.
  The last of the votes have been tallied and we're getting the final
  results in now.
  Quahog's new mayor is...
  Lois Griffin.
  Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
  Oh. Were we done cheering?
  Well, Mrs. Mayor, how do you feel?
  Oh, I'm a little nervous, Brian,
  but mostly I'm excited about all the good I'm gonna get to do.
  Wow, look at you.
  All that power and you've still got that body.
  And the first thing I'm going to do as mayor is clean up Lake Quahog.
  Well, I know the people will support you, Lois, because you connect
  with them.
  Like Disney connects with it's audience.
  - You da cow! - No, you da cow!
  Wow, Disney gets us.
  Quahog Town Hall.
  And I think we all realize the importance of stopping
  the environmental damage being done to Lake Quahog,
  which is why I'm proposing a very modest tax increase that will help us
  to...
  No, no, no, that's awful. No, no, no, I'm not okay with that.
  No new taxes!
  No new taxes!
  No new taxes!
  No new taxes!
  But what about the terrorists?
  That's right, terrorists.
  We have intelligence that suggests that...
  Hitler is plotting with...
  with the Legion of Doom...
  to assassinate Jesus...
  using the lake as a base.
  Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom...
  How did she discover our plan?
  Me, Solomon Grundy, kind of dropped the ball on that one.
  And we alsohave evidence that...
  Darth Vader tried to buy yellowcake uranium...
  from unwed teenage mothers.
  Those things all sound scary.
  How much money before it can feel safe again?
  Um... a hundred thousand?
  I threw a ten. See that ten there? I threw that.
  At the top of the news, Lake Quahog is once again clean,
  thanks to the efforts of newly elected mayor, Lois Griffin.
  We now go to Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa, for her slant on the
  story.
  Thanks, Tom.
  Once again, happy locals are frolicking in the waters of Lake Quahog.
  And we're here with their reactions.
  Sir, how does it feel to have the lake back?
  Well, I'll tell you, Tricia, as a local resident,
  I feel like I can once again take pride in my community.
  I think this is really gonna revitalize tourism.
  And if you look around, I think even the wildlife is starting to come
  back.
  And, you know, that's something we haven't seen in a while.
  I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of that.
  Hey, you guys.
  Mom, everyone on TV says you're running the town great.
  Maybe you can do some damn laundry once in a while.
  - What? - What?
  Wow, Mom, is that a new purse?
  Yeah, that looks pretty expensive.
  Well, don't tell anybody, Brian, but I was a little naughty.
  I may have dipped into the tax surplus.
  Wait a minute, you used taxpayer money to buy yourself a handbag?
  It's no big deal, Brian.
  Besides, there was a lot left over after the lake cleanup
  and I figured maybe I earned a little treat, huh?
  Lois, spending even one penny of that money on yourself is incredibly
  unethical.
  Oh, come on, it was only $600.
  My God, that's more than I spent to go see that prizefight in Vegas.
  I thought you said we was going to see Hairspray.
  Bitch, I thought I said just shut up and be lookin' fine.
  What the hell's up with these rolling blackouts?
  Well, since Lois is the mayor,
  I'm allowed to reroute all the town's electricity.
  What'd you do that for?
  So I could reanimate the corpse of Jim Varney.
  Howdy, Vern.
  This is some dad-gum nicehouse you got here, Vern.
  That's Vern, V-Vern,Vern, Vern.
  Oh, wait, wait, it was John Belushi, that's who I wanted.
  Peter, how could you...?
  Way ahead of you, Brian. My mistake, I'll take care of this.
  - Hey, Jim, come out in the yard, will ya? - Sure thing, Vern.
  He got the shotgun, Brian!
  Don't ask me how he did it, but Jim Varney got the shotgun!
  - Run for your life! - What?!
  Run!
  Excuse me, how much is this coat?
  It's $4,300.
  Oh.
  Do you think you can give me a little mayoral discount?
  Well, I think you're doing a great job, Mrs. Griffin, but my boss would
  kill me.
  - How's everything going out here? - Fine, Mr. Voorhees.
  Good. 'Cause if you screw up, I'll kill ya.
  Hi. Bob Grossbeard, Quahog Oil.
  I'd like to buy you that coat.
  Really?
  All I ask in return is that you let my company do
  just a little bit of dumping in your lake.
  This guy don't sit right with me, Lois. He don't sit right with me.
  But I just cleaned up Quahog Lake.
  Do you want the coat or not?
  - I want the coat. - Excellent.
  Then we have a deal.
  Ugh, Brian's gonna be really upset when he finds out.
  Eh, I'll just take him for a ride in the car, he'll forget all about it.
  Wait a minute, I know where we are. The park is near here.
  We're near the park, Lois. Oh, that's the tree. I peed on that.
  Hey. Hey, Lois. Lois. There's another dog in that car.
  H-Hey, hey, hey! There's another dog in that car. Hey!
  Are you seeing that?! Hey! Hey! Hey!
  Other dog, fuck you!
  Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Quahog Oil Refinery,
  we would like to thank Mayor Lois Griffin for our newest waste pipe.
  Let the dumping resume.
  Hey, Jake, how long can you hold your breath under water?
  Longer than you. Check it out.
  Aah! My face!
  Lois, what the hell are you doing?
  Remembering who I am, you crook.
  Oh, I'm a crook, am I?
  What about all the money you embezzled?
  You want people to find out about that?
  You better play ball, or we'll find someone else who will.
  I'll play ball.
  You know what, West? You can have your job back.
  Politics does terrible things to good people.
  Good for you, Lois. You wised up before it was too late.
  I was so consumed by power and money,
  I became the very thing I set out to destroy.
  Hooray! I'm mayor again!
  Don't we need to have a whole new election?
  There. Now no one will have heard him say that.
  We all heard him say it.
  Anybody else hear anything?
  My wife did.



Title: Meet the Quagmires

Hey, Quagmire, how was your date last night?
  Cleveland, it was amazing. You know what I discovered last night?
  - Women have a fourth hole. - What?
  Yeah. I mean, it's only visible
  if you're looking from exactly the right angle,
  like the entrance to Hogwarts.
  But you got to believe that it's there.
  Man, I envy you single guys.
  No families, partying whenever you want.
  These are the only people I get to party with.
  That's where the fourth hole is, right there.
  Right there in the back of the knee.
  I like having a family. I got all the crazy out of my system when I was
  18.
  Not me. I was dating Lois the whole time.
  I never got to be wild.
  Except for that time I rode the mechanical bull at that bar.
  Oh, my God, how embarrassing!
  Look how much fun I am!
  It's like I missed out on half my life.
  What I wouldn't give to be 18 again,
  like those kids on spring break.
  Grim news from Daytona, Florida,
  where the remains of three female college students
  were found near a local nightclub.
  Reports suggest that all three were violated sexually
  before being brutally murdered.
  Oh, man, see that?
  Everybody's getting laid but me.
  Oh, come on!
  Hang on, I'll fix it.
  Oh, my God, is he dead?
  I think he might be dead!
  Oh, did you hear that?
  Noah Wylie here thinks he might be dead.
  Step aside, Junior.
  Nope, he's just knocked out.
  Damn, I drove all the way out here.
  I had to cancel another appointment.
  I never like to be too far away from Mike Wallace.
  Hey, Death,
  I-I got a favor to ask you.
  Could you let me go back in time and be 18 again?
  What, are you high? No.
  Coming up next on ESPN,
  - Women's Professional... - All right, you win.
  Let's go. But just for one night.
  What the hell? Where are we?
  Oh, my God, this is...
  this is Newport Country Club!
  I used to be a towel boy here!
  That's right, Peter. You're 18 years old again.
  At least that's how everyone'll see you.
  Hey, Peter, slap me five.
  Slap me ten.
  Around the side.
  And back again.
  Up high.
  Down low.
  Now over by the diving board.
  Now on the other side of the pool.
  All right, now I want you to meet me at this address
  in an hour, and we'll slap five there.
  Then afterwards, we'll hit the bars.
  That sounds good to me.
  I'm 18, and I'm ready to do some living.
  We are gonna raise more hell than Hellraiser.
  Hey, honey,
  - you want some salt for your steak? - Yeah, sure.
  Aha, gotcha!
  That's more salt than you wanted.
  Hello, boys.
  Wow.
  18-year-old Lois.
  Son of a bitch.
  I see those ivory lies in sweet Rosita's eyes
  Gonna leave them both behind
  When we 'tomaso all night
  Hi, Peter.
  I'm really looking forward to the movie tonight.
  Peter and I are going to see Zapped.
  I figured Scott Baio was androgynous enough
  that we could both fantasize about him, and no one would be gay.
  Lois, we got the rest of our lives
  for me to not hear a word you just said,
  but tonight, I got plans with Cleveland.
  But we had a date.
  Could I Wham my Oingo Boingo into your Velvet Underground?
  Stay tuned for President Ronald Reagan's weekly radio address.
  Ronald Reagan?!
  The actor?!
  He's president?!
  Peter, you're the one from the future. You should know... Ah, forget it.
  Oh, you've got to hear this new Eddie Murphy cassette I bought.
  Hey, did you ever have a barbecue?
  I have!
  Wow. You're really good at this game.
  Yeah, I've logged a lot of game hours on Menstrual Ms. Pacman.
  What?! What?!
  - Geez. - Nothing. - Bitch.
  So, uh,
  - have you seen Ghostbusters? - Save your breath, geekwad.
  I'm here with my boyfriend.
  You mean that quintessentially '80s guy with his collar turned up all
  the way?
  Are you hitting on my girlfriend?
  - That was nice. - I'll say.
  Peter, is that...? Are you...
  - Molly Ringwald? - Yeah. How's it going?
  Wow, you're the biggest star in the world right now.
  What are you doing here?
  Oh, I like to hook up with random bar guys.
  Lucky for me, huh?
  No, a hobby's good.
  All right, Peter, your time's up.
  - Aw, man, already? - Yup, come on.
  Good to meet you, Molly. I'll be back later for your career.
  Well, I hope you got your fill, Peter.
  Death, that was totally worth it.
  It was even better than the time I stumbled into
  that fat, lonely women's club.
  Uh, excuse me, could I get directions to the Providence Civic Center?
  - Do you like cake? - Yes.
  - Do you like my ass? - Yes.
  Do you want to eat cake off my ass?
  What kind of cake?
  Angel food cake.
  Well, Rusty,
  looks like we're gonna eat our way out of another jam.
  Honey, you awake?
  Morning, sweetie.
  Who the hell are you?! What are you doing in my bed?!
  Peter, it's me. Molly? Your wife?
  Molly Ringwald?
  You're my wife?!
  We've been married for 20 years. What's wrong with you?
  Hi. I'm Judd Nelson.
  I crash here once or twice a week.
  Brian, Molly Ringwald is in my bed, and she says she's my wife!
  That's not all.
  Look at this place. Everything's different.
  This is crazy.
  Brian, did you ever see that Twilight Zone episode?
  You know, where the woman wakes up in the hospital,
  and all the doctors are pigs?
  Yeah.
  I like that one.
  But what the hell is going on here?
  You know, I think I have a theory.
  It's possible that when we went back in time,
  we somehow altered the past.
  Geez, Brian, that's more ridiculous
  than the theory of why Tom Cruise runs in all his movies.
  Wow, that cameraman has nice strong arms.
  You can't catch me, gay thoughts.
  - Hey, where the hell is Lois? - That's weird.
  Looks like she's coming out of Quagmire's house.
  Lois, what the hell?
  I'm gone for one night, and you sleep with Quagmire?!
  Mr. Griffin, what I do with my husband is none of your business.
  - Husband? - Morning, Pete.
  Hope you and Molly can still join us for dinner tonight.
  Come here, baby. Let's go play Schoolgirl
  And Guy Who Has Sex With Schoolgirl.
  Brian, what the hell is going on?!
  We were only in 1984 one night, and now everything's all messed up.
  I think I can explain it to you, Peter.
  This line represents the normal flow of events.
  Here's where you met Lois,
  here's where you got married, and here's the present.
  And here's the night at the bar.
  Now, at some point during that evening,
  you did something that changed the course of your history,
  causing the time line to skew off into an alternate tangent,
  where you're married to Molly Ringwald,
  Quagmire's married to Lois,
  and for some reason, we have a chalk boarding the living room.
  Well, what are we gonna do?
  We got to figure out what happened at this point in time.
  And I'll tell you another thing that worries me.
  You ever hear the theory that if you kill a butterfly in the past,
  it can drastically alter the present?
  Well, who knows what else we changed.
  Tonight on The Tonight Show, movie star George Clooney.
  - Oh, he's good. - Comedian Dave Chappelle.
  He's funny. Like him.
  And musician Harry Connick Jr.
  Wow. What a show.
  And, now, ladies and gentleman,
  here's...
  Chevy!
  Oh, God, Brian, we messed up bad. We messed up real bad.
  Howdy, neighbors! Come on in.
  Hey, Lois, Peter and Molly are here!
  Chris, say hi to Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
  - Hi, Mr. Griffin. - How's it goin', man?
  Chris, Stewie!
  Oh, my God! All right, don't freak out, Peter.
  Don't freak out like you did when your goldfish died.
  Here you go, Lieutenant Shiny-Sides.
  It's okay. You don't have to eat it now.
  You're just sleeping.
  You'll eat it later.
  You'll eat it later, Lieutenant Shiny-Sides!
  Meg, stop staring at Mr. Griffin.
  I'm sorry, Peter.
  I'm afraid she's got her father's libido.
  What can I say? I'm a Vagitarius. Oh!
  Hey, did you guys hear on the news about President Gore
  hunting down and killing Osama Bin Laden with his bare hands?
  I know. Who would've thought Bin Laden
  was hiding out in the cast of Mad TV.
  Man, the perfect hiding spot.
  The one place no one would look.
  Oh, there's the pie.
  Lois, this is a huge mistake.
  What are you talking about, Peter?
  You're supposed to be married to me.
  We're the ones who were meant to be together. Not you and Quagmire.
  It's a little late for that, don't you think, Peter?
  I mean, there was a time back when we dated
  that I thought you might be the one,
  but as I recall, you were more interested
  in partying with your friends.
  Then Glenn came along, and stole my heart.
  When he kissed me that night at the Country Club Dance,
  I knew we'd be together forever.
  Hey Lois, I'm ready for your pie.
  And you made dessert, too! Oh!
  Oh, Glenn,
  I love all your sex jokes and your dirty puns.
  That's why I married you.
  - Let's go upstairs and do it. - Okay!
  Brian, going back in time ruined my life.
  We've got to get Death to send us back to 1984 again
  so I can undo what I did.
  Or we could just make the best of this.
  Al Gore is President.
  We could kind of just take that one and call it a win.
  I mean, with Bush, we didn't have flying cars that run on vegetable oil.
  Meet George Jetson
  His boy Elroy
  Daughter Judy
  Jane his wife
  No, no, no! No! No!
  I took this one out for you.
  You take this one, I keep this!
  You are not taking my whole wallet so you can go shopping.
  I was just going to buy some groceries.
  Bull crap.
  I don't care what it takes, Brian, I've got to get Lois back somehow.
  Well, the only one who can help us is Death,
  and he only shows up when somebody dies.
  That's gonna be tough.
  With President Gore's universal health care,
  people are living much longer these days.
  And with zero tolerance gun control
  and a strong, well-funded educational system,
  there's no street crime.
  Face it, Peter, you not marrying Lois
  was the best thing that ever happened to the world.
  I don't care! We've got to find a way to summon Death and quick.
  Well, that might do it.
  Death, oh, thank God you're here!
  Listen, you've got to send me back in time again
  so I can marry Lois.
  Man, it's been a busy day.
  Dick Cheney, the chairman of Halliburton,
  shot Supreme Court Justice Scalia in a hunting accident,
  and the bullet went right through him
  and killed Karl Rove and Tucker Carlson.
  Oh, my God, Peter, you can't marry Lois.
  I don't know who any of those people are.
  All right, hang on. Here we go.
  This is the exact moment in 1984 that I sent you to the first time.
  You've just got to manage not to screw it up again.
  Lois! Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!
  Hey, Peter, you all set to go see Zapped! tonight?
  I figure Scott Baio was androgynous enough that we...
  That we could both fantasize about him
  and no one would be gay, yeah, I know the joke.
  Hey, you know what, listen, Zapped! sucks.
  Why don't we go see Krull?
  Peter, you know I'm dying to see Zapped!.
  I would much prefer Krull.
  Well, maybe you should just go by yourself.
  - Well, maybe I will. - Fine.
  Crap. Death!
  - What? - One more time.
  Hey, Peter,
  you all set to go see Zapped! tonight?
  I figured Scott Baio was androgynous enough that we...
  That's hilarious!
  You are a delight.
  And Zapped! is one of my favorite movies.
  I look forward to watching it with you, sweetheart.
  Oh, wonderful.
  Death!
  Hey, Peter,
  you all set to see Zapped! tonight?
  - I figured Scott Baio... - Yes.
  Scott Baio, gay, blah, blah, blah, blah. Ha, ha, ha...
  I can't wait to see the movie.
  Well, terrific. I'll see you tonight.
  Oh, hey, Peter.
  Say, I was just getting ready to hit the town.
  You want to join me?
  I can't, Cleveland, I got a date with Lois.
  It's gonna to be fun.
  It is?
  Peter, what the hell are you doing? You're supposed to be with Lois.
  Aw, crap! Death!
  No. You know what? I'm not doing it again.
  Screw this. No more mulligans. You're on your own.
  Oh, damn it, Brian, what the hell am I gonna do now?
  I haven't screw up this bad since I bought Joe Piscopo that barbell set.
  All right Joe, now don't get carried away with this.
  Don't worry, Peter. I'll only work out during my downtime.
  Oh, look who it is. Only 14 hours late.
  If you don't want to spend time with me, Peter, that's fine.
  But at least don't make me wait up all night for you.
  Lois I'm so sorry.
  I promise, I'll make it up to you tonight.
  We can watch any stupid movie you want.
  Sorry, I've already got plans.
  What do you mean plans?
  I'm going to the Country Club Dance with Glenn.
  I wanted to surprise you with the invitation last night,
  but you never showed up.
  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready.
  Peter, the Country Club Dance is where Lois said
  she fell in love with Quagmire.
  If they kissed at that dance, you're finished.
  You're right, Brian. We've got to stop them.
  And I think I know how.
  - Peter! - Oh, God, sorry! Sorry!
  Sorry. You're right, let's go to the dance.
  Peter used to be so passionate.
  Suddenly he just doesn't seem very interested in me anymore.
  Lois, if I may speak freely, as a friend?
  You deserve better than Peter.
  You deserve a gentleman.
  Oh, Glenn, you're so sweet.
  - Oh! Something popped me. - It's okay, it's ok.
  It's just my wang.
  Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.
  - What? - It's a line from Die Hard.
  Hasn't been made yet. We could ride it, Brian.
  After we're done with this, we could ride it.
  Oh, my God! You just crushed Andy!
  Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
  Oh, oh, you're sorry?
  Who's gonna play guitar?
  Oh, I love this song.
  Lois, may I have this dance?
  Peter, what are you doing here?
  I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.
  And not Quagmire or any man,
  she-male, robot or sentient robot curious about its own existence
  is going to keep you from me!
  Peter, I am here with Glenn.
  You had your chance with me and you blew it.
  Now leave us alone.
  Is that what you really want, Lois?
  Yes, it is.
  Well, I guess that's it.
  Who the hell am I kidding?
  I don't deserve her.
  Come on, Peter.
  Prove to Lois that you love her.
  It's your last chance.
  - Hey, Quagmire. - Huh?
  Sorry, Lois, but I have to do this.
  Oh, Peter,
  that was so passionate.
  Why, I didn't know I meant that much to you.
  Are you kidding?
  Lois, I couldn't bear to live without you.
  I came back thinking I was missing something in my life.
  But what I almost missed was the best thing that's ever happened to me.
  Lois Pewterschmidt,
  will you be my wife?
  Yes.
  Yes, I will.
  I think they want another one.
  Uh... okay.
  Here's a song by a gay guy.
  We're no strangers to love
  You know the rules and so do I
  A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
  You wouldn't get this from any other guy
  I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
  Got to make you understand
  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down 
  Never gonna run around...
  Whoa, whoa, big guy.
  You're probably never even gonna see him again.
  Never gonna say good-bye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you...
  Hey, Rick, it's your cousin, Marvin.
  Marvin Astley?!
  You know that mediocre, generic sound you've been looking for?
  Well, listen to this!
  Never gonna give Never gonna give
  Give you up
  Never gonna give Never gonna give
  Give you up
  Never gonna give...
  I didn't like any of that.
  Wow, Peter, that's an amazing story.
  And I'm touched that you went through so much trouble just to be with
  me.
  Obviously, I made the right choice when I married you.
  Me, too, Lois.
  And, hey, let's just all be grateful
  that things are completely back to normal again.
  Who ate all the pecan sandies?



Title: Blue Harvest

We now return to Sunday Golf on CBS.
  And Mickelson here, trying to save par.
  And there's Mickelson's wife. God, is she hot.
  Look at that rack. There's a downhill lie for you.
  Oh, and they're just out there, begging to be touched.
  Pleading.
  How many golf balls do you think she can fit in her mouth?
  I'd hit that one in the rough, if you know what I'm saying.
  Who are you kidding, Greg?
  You'd **** her for a week, and then get tired of her.
  Yeah, you're right. That's what I do. That's my thing.
  - But a hell of a week though. - Hell of a week.
  Oh, my God! The power's out!
  What are we gonna do now?
  Well, we could light some candles and read.
  - Yeah, right. - Yeah, that would be great
Yeah. Read the inside of my butt.
  We could tell stories.
  Hey, Dad, why don't you tell the story about when I was born?
  Yeah, we got halfway home with the afterbirth
  before we had to go back to the hospital and swap it out for Meg.
  The end.
  Now, I got a better one.
  This is a story of love and loss,
  fathers and sons,
  and a foresight to retain international merchandising rights.
  This is the story
  of Star Wars.
  Let's begin with part four.
  You hear that?
  Sounds like we're being boarded from the rear.
  And not the, "Hey, take a deep breath, let's experiment"
  kind of boarded from the rear.
  Beep boop.
  Could you hold on to this bag?
  What if they come in a different door?
  Damn! I was two days from retirement.
  R-2?
  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  - All right, now what do I click? - Click "preferences."
  - Okay, I clicked preferences. - Now go to "default media browser".
  Okay, there's a little hourglass, and it's not letting me do anything.
  - It says "buffering." What is that? - Just give it a minute.
  All I'm trying to do is make an mpeg.
  All I'm trying to do is tell you to wait a minute.
  Okay, relax.
  Now click "import video file."
  All right.
  It's telling me I have to download RealPlayer 7.
  You know what? I'll just bring it to him myself.
  There she is!
  Do you still got that bag I gave you?
  It's gonna be a long ride.
  Hold your fire. There's no life-forms aboard.
  "Hold your fire"? What, are we paying by the laser now?
  You don't do the budget, Terry. I do.
  Hey, I'm gonna do some crosswords, but...
  - that doesn't mean I don't want to talk. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
  My God! Look at this mess!
  "Hey, Darth Vader's gonna be here. Should we maybe clean the place up?"
  "Nah. It's okay. He won't mind."
  Well, well! Princess Leia.
  Are you prepared to tell me what you've done with the stolen Death Star
  plans?
  All right, Lord Vader. You win.
  I've hidden the plans in one of these 26 briefcases.
  Ooh! Ooh! Okay, okay!
  Uh... uh... I'm feeling number 14! Let's go with number 14!
  Oh, it's okay. I'm just happy to be on TV.
  All right. Take her away.
  Okay, here's another one. Who would you rather do :
  Jabba the Hutt right after a shower or a service droid?
  My father was a service droid!
  Hey, where ya going?
  You can kiss the lower part of the back of the canister that is my body.
  Oh, man! This looks like the wrong neighborhood.
  Oh, boy.
  It's okay, R-2. Calm down. Be cool.
  I ain't done nothing to antagonize nobody.
  What? A droid can't walk down the desert no more?
  I got rights, too.
  Who's there?!
  Any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless
  gesture
  no matter what technical data they've obtained.
  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
  That is fantastic. Terrific work.
  - So, no weaknesses at all, huh? - Nuh...
  No.
  You, uh... you hesitated there. Is there something I should know?
  No. It's virtually indestructible. Like, 99.9%.
  Uh... okay.
  Wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask. What's the .01?
  Well, I... I mean, there's this little hole...
  It was kind of an aesthetic choice by the architect.
  And, if you shoot a laser into this hole...
  the station blows up.
  That sounds like a pretty big design flaw there.
  No, no, no. The hole's only two meters across.
  Well, that's no bigger than a womprat.
  Exactly.
  And even to get within range of it, you have to skim along this whole
  trench.
  It's not a big deal.
  Can't we board it up? Or, you know, put some plywood over it or
  something?
  Well, that would look terrible.
  I mean, we gotta think about resale.
  Resale? What are you talking about?
  This property is right above Sunset. The value is only gonna go up.
  Lord Vader, your inside references to the Los Angeles real estate market
  haven't given you the clairvoyance to turn a profit on that condo in
  Glendale,
  nor has it...
  I find your lack of faith disturbing.
  That property is in a prime location.
  20 minutes to the beach, 20 minutes to downtown...
  There's nothing to do downtown.
  Enough of this!
  Vader, release him!
  As you wish.
  All right, so we gonna plug up that hole?
  Yeah. We can get it done tomorrow if price is no object.
  - We'll get estimates. - Get estimates. Yeah.
  Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
  - Look, sir. Droids! - Look! A penny!
  Hey, thanks for the sex, early '90s printer.
  All right, bring 'em on out.
  Oh, God, it's a hundred degrees out here!
  If I pass out, please note that I'm wearing a Life Call bracelet
  with all my insurance information.
  Luke?
  Luke!
  Luke!
  What?!
  Tell Uncle Owen not to tell you that your father is Darth Vader.
  Aunt Beru, when are you guys gonna let me join
  the rebellion like all my friends?
  Oh, pff! Stop whining, Luke, and come have some blue milk.
  One of these days,
  I'm just gonna take off and join the rebellion whether you like it or
  not!
  Over my burned carcass!
  Hey, shut up with-a da nois-a!
  Hey, shut-up-a with-a da shut-up-a!
  You shut-up-a with-a da shut- up-a!
  Shut-up-a yo face! Now-a my dog-a won't-a shut-up-a!
  - Why you no-a shut up-a? - I make-a you-a shut-up-a!
  - You two-a shut-up-a! - Hey, I poke out-a my head!
  Someday
  I'll get off this rock and fight the empire.
  John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra, everybody!
  Now do the theme to The People's Court.
  Oh, this oil bath is going to feel so good.
  Hey, you guys think that '90s printer looked clean, right?
  Hey, there's something stuck in this R-2 unit.
  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  Whoever she is, she sounds like she's in trouble.
  Is there any more to this message?
  Intergalactic proton-powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids!
  Intergalactic proton-powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids!
  Intergalactic proton-powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids!
  Hi, I'm Darth Harrington of Darth Harrington's Intergalactic Proton-
  Powered Electrical-Tentacled Advertising Droids Emporium and Moon Base.
  Due to a garbled sup-space transmission,
  I am currently overstocked on all intergalactic proton-
  powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids,
  and I am passing the savings on to you!
  She said, "Obi-Wan Kenobi."
  I wonder if she means old Obi-Wan Kenobi.
  Well, I guess I'll go bull's-eye some womprats in my T-16.
  My God, you shoot small animals for fun?
  That's the first indicator of a serial killer, you freak.
  There's two suns and no women!
  What the hell am I supposed to do?!
  Master Luke, he's gone, he's gone!
  What?
  R-2, he took off in the middle of the night! We got to find him!
  Oh, what the phantom menace is that guy's problem?
  Hey, mind if I turn on the radio?
  WTAT, Tatooine's all-talk radio.
  My good friends, the liberal galactic media is at it again.
  They never stop.
  Now they're trying to convince us that Hoth is melting.
  Well, that's crazy. Just trying to scare us.
  And if that weren't enough to get you mad,
  we now have news that Lando Calrissian has been made the chief
  administrator
  of the Bespin Mining Facility.
  Gee, I wonder how he got that job.
  Well, let me tell you how he got that job.
  Affirmative action strikes again.
  The time is 8:50.
  - R-2, what are you doing out here? - Beep-boop-beep.
  He says, "There are several creatures approaching from the southeast."
  That's not what I said.
  I said there ain't a pack of menthols on this planet.
  Well, I see some Bantha tracks, but I don't see any...
  Wait a minute. There's Sand People, all right. I can see one of them
  now.
  Who the hell are you?
  One lucky sumbitch.
  So, Luke, what brings your muscley arms out this way?
  I'll show you, Mr. Obi-Wan.
  R-2, play him the message.
  General Kenobi, many years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars.
  We need your help again.
  And not to get too personal, but...
  you owe us after that mess you got into back on Alderaan.
  ...and we pay to keep the families of those children quiet, so...
  Oh, this is just... just like logistical stuff.
  I'll check that later.
  ...Joey Lawrence haircut,
  so I'll assume we can count on your help
  to get the Death Star plans to my father on Alderaan.
  The plans are stored inside this R-2 unit.
  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  All right now, what do I click?
  Luke, you must learn the ways of the Force and come with meto Alderaan.
  What's the Force?
  The Force is what gives a Jedi knight his power.
  It surrounds us. It penetrates us.
  Here, check this out.
  Wow! This is cool!
  Yeah, everyone in the neighborhood has one.
  Hey, why would you hang that up? It looks so tantalizing.
  You know, the Empire's gonna come looking for these droids.
  But if they find out who the Jewas sold them to, that could lead them
  back...
  home.
  Luke, wait! It's too dangerous!
  Get your fat space ass back here.
  Uncle Owen?
  Aunt Beru?
  Oh, my God!
  John Williams!
  Great, now we got to do the rest of this thing with Danny Elfman.
  Mos Eisley Space Port.
  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
  My sister Regina D2 lives here.
  - Is she single? - She's a lezbot.
  - He doesn't like you. - Sorry.
  - I don't like you either. - You don't even know me.
  You know what? That's fair.
  I'm Pignose and this is my brother-in-law Scott.
  - He's visiting from Hoth. - I don't know why they call it Hoth.
  - They should call it "Coldth." - Okay, settle down.
  I'm up after the band.
  Thank you. We're the Cantina Band. If you have any requests, shout them
  out.
  Play that same song. All right, same song. Here we go.
  Hi. My sexy friend and I
  are looking for a ship to take us to Alderaan,
  and I'm willing to pay big money.
  Well, you've come to the right place.
  I'm Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon
  and the only actor whose career isn't destroyed by this movie.
  - Is it a fast ship? - Are you kidding?
  It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.
  Um...
  Isn't a parsec a unit of distance, not time?
  No, no, no, no.
  Chewie, take these guys to the ship and get her ready.
  Always gargle before a takeoff. Waka-waka. All right, let's go.
  Greedo, as a matter of fact, I was just going to see Jaba and tell
  him...
  - Well, what do you think? - What a piece of junk.
  Thank you. This was my brother's. He died of leukemia. How do you feel
  now?
  You got any strawberry milkin there?
  No, but she'll make .5 past lightspeed.
  If you want, I'll show you around
  since no one's trying to stop the ship or blast us.
  Stop that ship! Blast them!
  Oh, now I can't show you around. Quick, get in the ship.
  Looks like we got Imperial cruisers on our tail.
  Oh, look at that one on the left. Get off your cell phone. You are
  driving.
  They're gaining on us!
  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them.
  Uh, that, thatwas your maneuver,
  moving slightly to the left?
  Well, I mean, we're not in the same place we were, huh?
  - That ought to confuse them. - Yeah, but you hardly did anything.
  You just started listinglazily to the left.
  I'm pretty sure they can keep up.
  - Where did they go?! - There they are.
  They're listinglazily to the left. Go left! Left!
  Boy, this guy knows some maneuvers.
  All right, strap yourselves in. I'm about to make the jump to
  lightspeed.
  Did he say "strap in" or "strap on"?
  Man, hyperspace always looks so freaky.
  Governor Tarkin,
  I recognized your foul stench as soon as I was brought on board.
  Um, actually, that's me.
  I made a Darth doody.
  Princess Leia, we've chosen to test our Death Star planet blower-upper
  gun
  on your home planet of Alderaan.
  No!
  She said, "No." Should we still do it?
  Yeah.
  So anyway, I says, "Forget the dental plan."
  "Forget sick leave. I just want a railing," you know?
  "One railing right here."
  Yeah, I know. I've almost fallen over that thing so many times.
  - So what did they say? - Oh, get this.
  They said they're worried we'd be leaning all day.
  - They said that? - Yeah.
  Well, none of this will matter when we're famous singers.
  - How am I doing? - Just keep your knees bent.
  Imagine you're spreading butter on a big piece of bread.
  That's it. Spread that butter...
  with the Force.
  Ha! You guys seem like crazy morons to me.
  You don't believe in the Force, do you?
  Oh, you mean that thing you just found out about, like,
  three hours ago and are now judging me for not believing in it?
  Do you believe in anything?
  Uh, yeah. Didn't you see my Kabbalah bracelet?
  - What's Kabbalah? - About a buck seventy-five.
  Honestly, I have no idea. I'm just a slave to trends.
  What the hell?
  Oh, my God, we came out of hyperspace into an asteroid field.
  Alderaan's been destroyed by the Empire.
  Maybe we should head for that small moon
  that's clearly a small moon and not anything else.
  That's no moon.
  It's a space station.
  Oh, crap, that got us in a tractor beam.
  Well, they're not gonna get me without a fight.
  You can't win.
  But there are alternatives to fighting.
  Like what?
  Like getting the hell out of here!
  No, just kidding. Can you imagine if I was like that?
  All right, just follow my lead and act real cool.
  All right, I'm gonna go knock out that tractor beam.
  And we'll go rescue the princess.
  You know Luke, this may be the last time we see each other.
  So there's something I want you to know.
  Now I've
  had the time of my life
  And I owe it all to you...
  I've been waiting for so long
  Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
  So we take each other's hand
  Cause we seem to understand the urgency
  Just remember
  You're the one thing
  I can't get enough of
  So I'll tell you something
  This could be love Because
  I've had the time of my life
  No I never felt this way before
  Yes, I swear, it's the truth
  And I owe it all to you...
  Holly smoke!
  So, whate **** we are on the first floor?
  Uh, we are on the second floor.
  No, no, no, **** here's the Banana republic and we just pass that.
  Uh...
  ... it's right back there. We, we, uh...
  we park on Macy's side, ****
  So now we must be other here by the JCPenney.
  It looks that the first floor is mostly main stuff, ****
  and there's a lady Foot Locker right other there. ****
  All right, so we are on the third floor.
  All right, let's get in the elevator.
  And hurry up, 'cause the smell of that Mrs. Fields is killing me.
  Where are you taking this... thing?
  Prisoner transfer from cell block 1138.
  You think you could get me a room by the pool?
  Is funny because you are prisoner.
  And there is no pool because is Death Star.
  We got to find out what cell this princess of yours is in.
  - There it is, 2187. - I'm on it.
  Uh, everything's under control here. Situation normal.
  What happened?
  We, uh, had a slight weapons malfunction, but
  everything's perfectly all right. We're fine.
  We're all fine... here... now...
  thank you.
  How are you?
  Uh... I've been better.
  - Well, tell me what's up. - Well,
  I'm in this relationship and it doesn't seem to be going
  anywhere.
  I like her, but... we're not really connecting.
  - How long's it been? - About ten months.
  - And how often do you see each other? - Couple of times a
  week.
  Well, why don't you try seeing each other a little more often
  and see if you connect a little more.
  And if not, it may be time to move on.
  Thanks for calling.
  This is Han Solo,
  and I'm going to be keeping you company for the next few hours,
  right here on the midnight shift.
  Something's telling me it might be you...
  It's telling me it might be you...
  Aren't you a little fat to be a storm trooper?
  Well, stay here and rot, you stuck-up bitch.
  Wait. Who are you?
  I'm Luke Skywalker.
  Me and Han Solo and Obi-Wan are here to rescue you.
  - Wait, Obi-Wan Kenobi? - Yeah.
  Suddenly I'm not so fat, huh?
  Come on, into the garbage chute.
  She's right. Come on, Chewbacca.
  Are you kidding? It's probably full of disease. I'm not jumping in
  there.
  Not even if I throw this pig's ear?
  - Oh, come on, that's not fair. - Go get it!
  Oh, boy, great idea, Princess, diving into a pile of garbage.
  When we get out of here, maybe you can show me around
  your home planet of Alderaan.
  Aw...!
  Too soon?
  Hey, it could be worse.
  It's worse.
  The walls are closing!
  Listen to them, R-2. They're dying. What do we do?
  Only one thing to do, man.
  You still got that bag I gave you?
  Man, I wish I could listen to some Tattooine, Wind and Fire right now.
  Mm...
  So you think the Empire's gonna fall, man?
  I-I-I don't...I don't know, man.
  H-How you, how you, how you, how you doing right now?
  Good. Why?
  I think,
  I think, I think I... I think I may be having sort of... a mini
  freak-out here.
  - Oh. - Just-Just...
  Just tell me I don't have to stay in this room.
  What?
  Just tell me right now that I... that I don't have to stay in this room.
  You don't have to stay in this room.
  Oh, thank God.
  Thank God we're saved.
  Look at this. Who throws out half a pizza?
  And look at this couch.
  Somebody threw out a whole couch and it's in great shape.
  Yeah, you put a little Febreze on that,
  scrub it out a little bit, it'll look great in your apartment.
  You know what?
  I know we have a dangerous job to do here, but
  I'm taking this.
  I'm taking this couch.
  All right, you ready?
  All right, one... two... three.
  - Easy, easy, easy. - Okay.
  - Stop, stop, stop, stop... - What? What...?
  - No, no, no, no... Twist it. - I am.
  No, no, no, no, no, other way. You're twisting the wrong way.
  - What do you want me to do? - Just look down, all right.
  Just look at me, look what I'm doing.
  - You see the way I'm twisting it? - Yeah.
  - Turn it that way from your end. - Okay.
  No, no, no, no, no.
  Put it down. Put it down. Just drop it.
  All right. All right.
  All right, let's...
  Just hang on and figure this out.
  Han, there are storm troopers all over the place.
  Shouldn't we be getting out of here?
  All right, okay, all right, okay.
  I got it, I know... okay, okay...
  Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna take the cushions off,
  unscrew the legs,
  take the mattress out and this whole thing is gonna be a lot simpler.
  It's easier than we're making it.
  Hey, did you hear something?
  Probably just another drill.
  You know that last drill we had?
  I was about to finally bone my girlfriend,
  and then we heard that there was this drill
  and she told me there was no way.
  So, Obi-Wan...
  we meet again.
  What part of "stay 50 yards away at all times" don't you understand?
  Uh-oh.
  Your powers are weak, old man.
  Obi-Wan!
  Boy, you got here just in time.
  No...!
  All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
  All right, twist it counter-clockwise.
  I am twisting it. You're twisting it the other way.
  I mean counter-clockwise from where I'm standing
  so... so th... so then you...
  so clockwise.
  You twist it clockwise.
  Okay... okay, go.
  You know what? Put it down, put it down for a second.
  - My fingers are killing me. - Han, they're shooting at us!
  You know what? Lift it up tall ways.
  Aw, for cr... oh, it's wedged. It's wedged.
  You know what? It's not going anywhere. Let's just take off,
  we'll deal with it later.
  You get in the cockpit and I'll just...
  I'll hang on to this thing as we go.
  Easy.
  I can't believe he's gone.
  I know, Luke, but it's true.
  He's gone.
  I mean, you saw him get beheaded.
  Nobody lives through that... Not for long, anyway.
  I mean, sometimes the brain is still active for a few minutes
  after the beheading, but...
  to be honest, I can't imagine a worse kind of hell.
  And unfortunately,
  hell is probably where he'll end up,
  because the Christians don't look too kindly on the whole Force thing.
  Come on, kid, we're not out of the woods yet.
  Here they come!
  - Hey, Han! - What?!
  - Why do they call them "Tie Fighters"? - - No idea!
  They're coming too fast!
  Oh, boy. Nickel for every time that's happened.
  Just keep shooting, Luke!
  That's how we do it in my neighborhood, bitch!
  I got him! I got him!
  Great, kid! Don't get penis-y!
  I just want to tell you both...
  Good luck. We're all counting on you.
  Mom?
  Yeah. Yeah we won.
  Yeah, we won the battle.
  Yeah, I'm calling like you asked.
  Okay.
  Okay.
  Okay, but... okay, but I gotta go...
  I got other stuff to do.
  O-Okay
  Okay, okay, but I gotta go.
  Okay.
  Okay, yes.
  Yes.
  Yes, yes, Mom.
  I-I love you too, Mom. Okay, all right, good-bye.
  P-choo. P-choo.
  Gotcha.
  Thanks to the information in this R-2 unit provided by Princess Leia,
  we should be able to mount a successful offensive on the Death Star.
  But first,
  please take a moment to watch this instructional video.
  Nothing but net.
  Hi,
  I'm Magic Johnson with a few tips on blowing up the Death Star.
  First off, never forget your objective.
  There gonna be so many folks coming at you to slow you down,
  you might feel like you got a bull's-eye on your head.
  No, but they will be trying to kill you.
  Also, don't forget you have teammates out there watching your back.
  Unless you been messing around with their wife or girlfriend.
  No, but they will be there to help you.
  Lastly,
  you wanna make sure you step back and take cover after you sink that
  bucket,
  'cause that sky gonna light up like the Fourth of July.
  No, but there will be a large explosion.
  Well, kid, I guess this is good-bye.
  So, you got your reward and you're leaving. Is that it?
  When you say it that way, I sound like a douche,
  but, yeah, that's what I'm doing.
  What'd you get for a reward anyway?
  Uh, let's see, I got 10% off a Netflix membership,
  uh...
  some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar,
  assorted lotions, and a little plastic champagne bottle full of jelly
  beans...
  and a little bear.
  See? Little bear?
  "Hey, Luke. We had fun on the Death Star."
  Well, take care of yourself, Han.
  I guess that's what you're best at.
  Oh, look, a light saber cheese knife.
  Yuck.
  All wings. Check in.
  - Red three standing by. - Red six standing by.
  - Red five standing by. - Red Buttons standing by.
  - Redd Foxx standin' by! - Big Red standing by.
  - Red October standing by. - Helen Reddy standing by.
  Simply Red standing by.
  I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins!
  Uh, having a little trouble here.
  Careful, Redd Foxx, there's one right on your tail!
  Ahh! I'm comin', Elizabeth!
  Use the Force, Luke.
  - Obi-Wan? - Yeah, it's me.
  Use the Force.
  Force that thing in there.
  Just like I showed you with those puppets.
  but don't tell anybody 'cause you'll get in trouble.
  Clark, I don't like the look of this neighborhood.
  Come on, Ellen, it's important for the kids
  to witness the plight of the rebellion.
  Kids, you noticing all this plight?
  Roll 'em up!
  The Force is strong with this one.
  **** you, you son of a bitch!
  What am I, R2-Pac?!
  The Death Star is getting closer.
  And Leia's getting larger!
  I have you now, young Skywalker!
  And with today's gas prices, not a minute too soon.
  What the deuce?!
  Look at this.
  Look how much more comfortable we are now shooting stuff.
  Luke, the Force will be with you always.
  And so will I.
  Always.
  'Course, when you get older and get some crow's feet,
  I might lose interest.
  The end.
  Well, Dad,
  thanks for keeping us entertained.
  That was a great story.
  Yeah, but
  didn't Robot Chicken already do this three months ago?
  Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Chris.
  I don't think people are even aware of that show's existence.
  Well, I don't know, Dad. I think a decent number of people watch it.
  Oh really? Define "decent."
  I think it's the highest-rated show on Cartoon Network
  and the Star Wars episode doubled that audience.
  Well, yeah, but double ten people is like 20 people,
  so, I mean, what kind of numbers are we talking about here, you know?
  Don't be glib about this stuff, Dad.
  It's a legitimate show and they beat you to the punch.
  Uh... I don't know about that, Chris.
  I mean, to me, a legitimate show is on ABC, CBS, NBC...
  You know, one of the real networks.
  I don't know about that, Dad.
  And besides, what's up with that 15-minute runtime?
  What is that? It's like 15 minutes of guys playing with Star Wars dolls?
  - Oh, yay, yay, tune me into that. - Oh, so you do know the show.
  I read part of a review online. I am not a fan.
  You know, Dad, you're a real jerk!



Title: Movin Out Brians Song

This Tuesday on Lifetime,
  Valerie Bertinelli stars in a Lifetime original movie.
  You know, Doctor, you said you were going to cure my cancer,
  but all you did was rape me!
  I'm starting to think I don't have cancer at all.
  Well, you're right, about the rape part,
  but I'm sorry, you still do have cancer.
  Valerie Bertinelli in...
  Brian, did you know that Daryl Hannah has one wooden finger?
  Really? Where did you read that?
  - In Pee-opple magazine. - Huh.
  Jillian, can you, uh, run and get me a beer from the kitchen?
  Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.
  Hey, Jillian, you and Brian got big plans tonight?
  Yeah. Brian's taking me to Disney On Ice.
  - I want to go. - Uh...
  Well, Peter, if you want, you can have my ticket.
  What? But, Brian, I thought you wanted to go?
  Stitch is going to do a skating duet with Sebastian the Crab.
  It's not really my cup of tea.
  Plus, Walt Disney was an outspoken anti-Semite.
  So, Disney, ABC, ESPN, Touchstone... these would all be things to avoid.
  Well, oh, okay.
  Um, Peter, you want to go see Disney On Ice?
  Oh, God, yes!
  I'll be right back. I'm going to go put on my Donald Duck costume.
  Ready.
  Meg, lend me 25 cents so I can ride the toy airplane outside
  and make the immigrant kids jealous.
  Look at me!
  I'm having a magical aerial adventure because my family has disposable
  income.
  Here you go.
  What is this?
  It's a pamphlet on why I'm bombing you.
  - Hey, Meg. - Hi, Carl.
  How come you're always here by yourself? Are you like a bitch or
  something?
  - No, I have friends. - Oh.
  Well, you should bring some of them in here.
  - Any of them have braces? - Yeah.
  I love braces.
  My mom has 'em.
  Well, listen, um...
  I need disposable diapers, but it looks like you're out.
  Oh, no, I got some in the stockroom. Hang on.
  Oh, Vince Vaughn's on the cover of Entertainment Weekly.
  Here's my summary of every Vince Vaughn movie:
"Oh, I'm incapable of loving another person."
"Oh, wait, no, I'm not. The end."
I don't even want to look at his face.
Stewie, what the hell are you doing?!
Oh, my God! Now I've got to clean up this up!
- Carl, I'm so sorry. - Wow, Meg,
you alphabetized all the magazines.
- Hey, you want a job? - What? Me?
- Here? Yeah, sure! - Great. You start tomorrow.
- Hey, Chris. - Hey, Meg.
I don't have any money so I'm going to have to pay
for these comic books with my poo.
Chris, how come you don't have any money? I thought you had a paper
  route.
  Well, I'm taking a sabbatical to focus on my pottery.
  Oh.
  - How's that working out? - Not good, Meg, not good.
  Well, maybe I can talk to Carl and get you a job here.
  - You could do that?! - Absolutely.
  Carl totally trusts me.
  You and I will be the best brother-sister team since Maggie and Jake
  Gyllenhaal.
  - I'm more off-putting. - No, I'm more off-putting.
  I'm more unattractive to put in a lead role.
  Well, I'm a bigger box office drag.
  Kids, kids. You're both...
  ...just awful.
  Oh, hi, Brian.
  I thought you were spending the day with Jillian.
  I was, but Peter took her off my hands.
  Perfect timing. I've been feeling a little smothered lately.
  Plus, it's given me a chance to work on my novel.
  - And I finally have a title. - Oh, what is it?
"Faster Than the Speed of Love."
That is the worst title I've ever heard.
No, it's the story of a boy who has to rescue his father,
who's a pilot, that's been taken captive by a militant Islamic country.
- That's the movie Iron Eagle! - What?
Is that, is that a recent film?
They made three sequels!
Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's gotta gather all these old World War II
  pilots
  to help him rescue his father.
  That's one of the sequels!
  Well, well, in mine,
  one of the World War II guys is Japanese, but they accept him anyway.
  I'm going to pee in my pants!
  Boy, it sure is fun hanging out with you, Peter.
  That means "thank you" in my new language I'm inventing.
  Anyway, all I was saying is, if you think about it,
  it shouldn't have been Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
  It should've been Ferris Bueller's Day On,
  'cause that was all the stuff he wanted to do.
  Yeah. And he was so "on" that day, so it kind of works on two levels.
  Well, I don't know what you mean by that, but how about that Cameron,
  huh?
  - Oh, definitely. - Am I right?
  It was his day off, too.
  That is just what I was going to... His day off...
  that is just what I was going to say. You know, you are a catch, young
  lady.
  You know that?
  I don't know when the hell Brian is going to open his eyes
  and get serious with you.
  I really wish he would.
  It'd be so great if we were at least living together.
  Well, you need to just lay it on the line with him.
  Either he commits to you, or you're gone.
  What the hell did you do?!
  Because of what you said, Jillian wants us to move in together!
  Well, I think you should, Brian. She's beautiful, she's funny,
  and she is smart as the day is wide.
  Don't you understand?! I don't want a committed relationship with
  Jillian.
  Well, it sounds like she does.
  And if you're never going to get serious, then you're not being fair to
  her.
  You don't really think I'm like that, do you?
  Prove me wrong.
  All right, I will, Lois.
  I will ask her to move in with me. and you'll see, I've got what it
  takes.
  Boy, you know, I gotta tell you, Jillian, this move is really working
  out great.
  - It just feels right, you know. - Cool!
  - Rock on, Brian! - Okay, done.
  Stewie. Hey. What's up?
  Oh, I was just on my way back from the cobbler.
  Figured before I stopped by the apothecary,
  I'd come here, and then it's off to the haberdasher.
  These turn-of-the-century business jokes doing anything for you?
  Not really.
  - Did you use the jokes? - Yeah, they're not landing.
  Got your mail. So, how's it going?
  I tell you, Stewie, it's going great.
  And that's the worst part. I can't afford the rent.
  I'll be lucky if I can make it to the end of the month.
  Sounds like you need a roommate.
  Where did you get that kind of money?
  I picked up Chris's paper route.
  Oh, OshKosh B'Gosh,
  it's a brand-new paperboy.
  That's a mighty full sack you're carrying.
  Piss off, you perverted old freak!
  Oh, we got a fighter.
  Wow, you were almost in a dirt bike race?
  Yeah, yeah, I filled out most of the paperwork, too.
  You are the coolest guy I have ever met.
  Yep.
  Hey, guys. Um...
  Chris, I need you to stack the boxes in the back for me.
  Uh, you know what, Meg? Why don't you do that?
  I need Chris up here with me.
  But the boxes are really heavy.
  Oh, that's 'cause there's a bunch of stuff in them.
  Huh? Chris?
  Yeah.
  Uh, Chris, you ever see the movie Cruel Intentions?
  No.
  Oh, Selma Blair and Sarah Michelle Gellar make out.
  It's pretty hot.
  - 47 minutes, 16 seconds in. - No way!
  Yeah, yeah. You know what's another great movie?
  Career Opportunities with Jennifer Connelly.
  I mean, that's one of those movies that...
  I mean, she's really hot in it, but
  it's also a good movie.
  She was in A Beautiful Mind, and I've gotta say,
  the direction was excellent but I was very disappointed that she, um...
  wore clothes the entire film.
  Was she hot in it?
  Yeah, in the way that, like, classy women with expensive clothing
  who never take the moff are hot, you know?
  No.
  All right. So, like, you see a hotgirl,
  and you're like, okay, I appreciate your exterior beauty
  'cause you definitely worked at it with the clothing, and the jewelry,
  and the makeup and stuff, but secretly, I'm just like, hey, man...
  where is the chase and how do I cut to it?
  Wow, you're smart.
  What?
  Listen, I hope you don't mind Stewie staying with us for a little while.
  He, uh, he just gets really lonely without me at home.
  You're so fatherly. It really turns me on.
  Brian, there's no more graham crackers!
  They're in the cabinet!
  I don't see them!
  They're right in front of you! Which cabinet are you looking at?!
  - Can't you just come in here?! - No, I'm busy!
  Oh, no!
  Oh, no, Brian!
  Oh, no!
  Oh, no! Oh, Brian, we need paper towels!
  Oh! Oh, it's going under the fridge!
  Oh!
  Just use a dish towel!
  There aren't any, Brian! You need to come in here!
  Oh!
  We are going to have ants!
  Oh-ho, a hundred points!
  Meg, clean up aisle two.
  What the hell is this?! I am not cleaning this up.
  Meg, less talkie, more sweepy.
  Shut up, Chris! You can't tell me what to do.
  Uh, actually, Meg, as your supervisor, he can.
  Supervisor?
  - Yeah, I promoted him this morning. - Promoted me this morning.
  What?!
  Carl, you promised me that assistant manager position.
  Uh, Meg, things change.
  Hey, you ever see Broken Lizard's Club Dread?
  No.
  Well, go see that movie and absorb its message,
  and you'll get the gist of what I'm talking about.
  - Carl, this isn't fair! - All right, then, you're fired.
  What?
  But...
  No, you can't...
  Don't worry about it, Chris, she'll be fine.
  Hey, by the way, you know who else is hot in kind of a screwed up way?
  Mary Stuart Masterson.
  Yeah, yeah, in that sort of "you think you could get her,"
"cause she could be your brother" kind of thing.
Like, she's gettable, you know, like, like, Elizabeth Shue.
- Oh, I remember her. - Yeah.
You know, she was in Leaving Las Vegas in addition to Adventures in
  Babysitting.
  One of those underrated actresses that was always talented and
  beautiful,
  and never quite popped, if you know the meaning.
  - Who, Elizabeth Shue? - Yeah.
  Like totally naked in, um, Leaving Las Vegas.
  And, uh, still ,still so hot.
  Like, uh...
  - I don't see art films. - Like, like, crazy hot.
  Yeah, it's about 39 minutes, 45 seconds in.
  It's a really exceptional sequence.
  I mean, Nick Cage is poisoning himself with alcohol.
  He's a failed writer who just decides that,
"Ooh, I'm going to have a big last hurrah in Las Vegas."
And then he meets a whore and pays her a bunch of money to stay with
  him,
  uh, and have sex with him while he murders himself slowly.
  And, you know, she's game for it, but
  she catches feelings midway through and the whole thing changes.
  Wow, h-have youseen Cocktail?
  - Uh, yeah, yeah. - She was in that.
  - She was in that. - Yeah.
  - Ah, ah, you like that? - Yeah, it's rad!
  Don't talk, please. Hang on, let me get a condom.
  Brian, are you guys up?
  Stewie, what the hell are you doing? Go back to bed.
  But I'm not tired.
  And I'm lonely.
  Oh, come get in bed with us.
  Ooh, all right, "Dear Penthouse Forum."
  No, no, Stewie, go away!
  Brian, don't be mean to him.
  Yes, Brian, if you're mean to me, I'll stop paying the rent.
  - What did he say? - Uh, nothing.
  That's right, I'm paying Mr. Lickity-self's half of the rent.
  Is that true?
  All right, yes, fine, it's true!
  Why didn't you say anything?
  Because you wanted me to move in so badly, and God knows, I didn't want
  to...
  Wait...
  You didn't want to move in with me?
  Well, honestly, no.
  Oh, my God! I've never felt so stupid!
  - Really? - Really?
  Well, I don't want to be your guilty burden, Brian!
  We're through!
  Jillian, wait!
  Damn it.
  I'm sorry, Brian. You'll feel better in the morning.
  She's gone.
  Jillian's gone.
  Look, Brian, I know you're upset now,
  but I think it's important to see things in perspective.
  Remember when Alex P. Keaton lost his girlfriend?
  And then he got another one, and everything was all right?
  And then he got Parkinson's.
  Yikes.
  You know, Stewie, you're right.
  This is not a loss, it's an opportunity.
  I'm free now. I've got my own place, no attachments.
  There you are. That's just the kind of can-do spirit that built this
  nation.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,"
"that all men are created equal."
- Except the Jews. - Franklin, for the fifth time,
I'm sorry you overpaid for your house, but it's not going in.
- You'll be sorry. - Noted. Moving on.
So, Meg, any luck finding another job?
No.
Hardly anybody's hiring right now.
The only job I could find was for a phone sex line, and I sucked at it.
What am I wearing?
Um...
a hat...
and...
glasses.
What kind of underwear?
Um...
I don't know.
Big underwear, I guess.
I'm sorry, what?
Oh, what would I do to you?
Well, um...
I guess maybe we'd get pizza.
And...
we could watch House.
All right, I am totally flaccid, but thank you anyway, m'am,
I appreciated your time.
Mom, check it out!
I just got my paycheck and my salary's doubled ever since Meg got fired.
Oh, shut up, you bastard!
Chris, we should have a talk about Meg.
She's really upset that she got fired.
Gee, I didn't realize working at the store meant that much to her.
You know, it would mean the world to her if she could get her job back.
And you'd be one terrific brother if you could help her.
Well, gosh, Mom, I'll sure try.
Poor Meg.
She got a worse deal than that no-armed baseball player, Bucky LaGrange.
Ground ball to shortstop. The throw is to second,
and again, the ball sails past LaGrange into right field.
The runners will score and a cascade of "boos" rain down from
  the stands
  as clearly the fans' sympathy for this scrappy, little
  no-armed man
  has run out.
  Now, granted the throw was a little wide,
  but you've got to believe that a two-armed player would've
  made the catch.
  In fact a one-armed player would have at least had a shot at
  it,
  which calls to mind the question once again,
  why, with all the two-armed youngsters waiting in the minor
  leagues,
  does this team stick with an arm-less second baseman?
  - And he hasn't had a hit in ever. - In ever, Jerry. In ever.
  What the hell?! What are you people doing in my apartment?
  Hey!
  You made it.
  What is all this? What's going on?
  You, that's what's going on.
  Come on, time for you to meet some women
  who are going to make you forget about Jillian.
  Looks like there's a lot of gay guys here.
  Yeah, everybody's having a good time.
  Brian, I want to introduce you to Joanna.
  Look out for this one, she's a bit of a card.
  Okay, here's one for you.
  What food can't make up its mind?
  This is going to be good.
  A waffle.
  This one.
  Didn't I warn you, right?
  Right?
  How are you still single?
  Hey there, buddy. Check it out. Check it out.
  I put a cruller in the Jerry's Kids' jar.
  - I thought that would be funny. - That is hilarious, but,
  Carl, I want you to hire my sister back.
  No, Chris, she's a pain in the ass. I-I don't want her back in here.
  Well, that's a shame, because
  I watched Event Horizon last night.
  No way! We have to talk about it!
  Yeah, well, my memory is, uh, kind of hazy.
  We have to talk about every scene, man!
  Hey, hey, hey!
  Remember when Jack Noseworthy's eyes explode?
  Wasn't that awesome?!
  Please agree with me that that was awesome!
  Well, if you hire Meg back, maybe I'll have an opinion.
  She's hired, she's hired!
  What do you think of it?
  - It was awesome! - Wasn't it awesome?!
  - It was totally awesome! - It was the most awesome thing ever!
  Hug me!
  Hey, how you doing, Brian?
  Lousy.
  I know who can cheer you up.
  The robot from Space Camp.
  Brian and Jinx are friends.
  Get that out of here.
  Okay, how about the robot from Rocky IV?
  Look, Stewie, get these stupid '80s movie robots out of here,
  and leave me alone.
  It's all your fault that Jillian's gone.
  My fault?!
  Brian, you've got no one to blame but yourself.
  You let the fat man talk you into moving out.
  You let Jillian walk out the door.
  Stop getting pushed around.
  Be a man.
  If you want her, go get her.
  You know something?
  You are absolutely right. It is time for me
  to take charge of my own life.
  Stand aside,
  I've got to get my girl back.
  Go get her, Brian.
  Uh, hi.
  Hi, Brian.
  What are you doing here?
  Jillian,
  look, I made a huge mistake. I don't want to lose you.
  You know, you really hurt me, Brian.
  And I can't let you do that again.
  Look, I won't. I promise.
  I don't know how to tell you this, but you're too late.
  I met someone else.
  Jillian, do you get the Oxygen Network?
  If I miss my Moesha, I get a bit crabby.
  In a minute, Adam.
  Well...
  I guess this is good-bye.
  Please don't send me away.
  I have to.
  You broke my heart.
  Well, Meg, you got your job back.
  Actually, Chris, I don't.
  I really appreciate what you did for me, but I can't work for that guy
  anymore.
  He's a freak.
  The important thing is that you stood up for me.
  And I won't forget it.
  Oh, Brian, I know you miss Jillian, but it is good to have you back.
  Kind of sucks though.
  I mean, you are never going to find a chick that hot again.
  You know what the mistake was, moving in together.
  Well, it's just another life experience, I guess.
  Hey, and look on the bright side. Maybe you got another chapter for
  your book.

  Oh, yeah, pile it on, pile it on.
  Welcome home, douche bag!



Title: Believe It or Not Joes Walking on Air

We now return to Dr. Terry Fabulous, homosexual gynecologist.
  Okay, Mrs. Robinson, let's take a look.
  Ew! It looks like a sad, old man.
  Hey, check it out, you guys, I got a new cell phone that takes pictures.
  Look, look, I took a picture of Lois's poo.
  Oh, that's hilarious, you should e-mail that to me.
  Hey, did you guys see the game last night?
  - Oh, yeah. - That offensive line is outstanding.
  Yeah, you should e-mail me that picture.
  Hey, boys!
  What the hell are you guys doing here?
  Oh, we just decided to have a little girls' night out.
  Yeah, you guys talk about this place all the time,
  we figured we'd give it a try.
  Bernice, we haven't really been dating long enough
  for you to be hanging out with my friends' wives.
  - Shut up, Cleveland. - Okay.
  Oh, check it out, girls!
  Jukebox! Huh?
  Hey, you guys want to dance?
  - Yeah, totally! - Hell yeah!
  Oh, my God, this sucks!
  The Clam's the only place we got to get away from the women.
  This is a bigger disaster than Jack Black's last movie.
  We now return to Jack Black in
  The Unconventional Butler.
  Edgar, could you bring me some tea?
  Yeah!
  Yeah!
  Wait a minute. Butlers are supposed to be fancy and well-mannered.
  This guy's screaming and waving his arms around!
  You're an old man! You don't understand the young people.
  You're right. I'll change from now on.
  Oh my God, that was so much fun!
  You know, boys, we just might make this at regular thought.
  Peter.
  Peter?
  Yeah, sorry Joe, I just had one of my Scrubs fantasy moments.
  It's the best show you're not watching.
  I hate shows that cut away from the story for some bullcrap.
  Fellas, our way of life is being threatened
  and we got to do something about it.
  Couldn't we just ask the women to leave?
  No, no.
  I got something way more expensive and time-consuming in mind.
  Well men,
  the Quahog Men's Club is complete.
  It took six weeks and cost $8,000,
  but it was worth it.
  Peter, I wish you'd get rid of this thing. It's an absolute eye sore.
  What do you care, Lois? You girls got the Clam,
  we got the Quahog Men's Club.
  Besides we not hurting anybody.
  What are you talking about?
  You ripped a whole chunk of wall out of the house!
  What is this?!
  There's something wrong with the house!
  I don't like change!
  Peter, you can't just slap together flimsy structures in the yard.
  Why not? Herbert did it.
  Y-M-C-A
  It's fun to stay at the
  Y-M-C-A...
  All right, Peter, this is a tough one. All right you ready for this?
  Okay,
  would you have sex with Cleveland.
  if it meant you could have sex with Angelina Jolie.
  Yeah, yeah, I'd probably do it.
  Hang on, hang on.
  Missionary,
  and you have to look him in the eyes,
  no closing your eyes and pretending it's somebody else.
  - I think still yes. - Thank you, Peter.
  All right, here's another one. Who would you rather have sex with?
  A very pregnant Gina Gershon
  or Jenny McCarthy after a car accident?
  Well, hang on, hang on...
  You know, I know this is a men's club but
  why does it always have to be about sex?
  Okay, look, how about this, how about this?
  Who would you rather start a small business with,
  Janet Reno after a safari,
  or the fat guy from My Name is Earl?
  That still sounds like a sex question.
  It is not.
  Well, then, what the hell does "safari" have to do with it?
  What's the guy from Earl's credit rating?
  651.
  - That's not bad. - Better than mine.
  Does he have an idea, or do I have to come up with it myself?
  He's got an idea, but it's not quite there.
  I'd have to give it to Janet Reno, 'cause I've always had this business
  plan
  for a home delivery of prescription medications,
  and that seems like it's more her market.
  This is stupid! I want to talk about vaginas!
  Well, I'd say the men's club inaugural ball is a huge success.
  Hey, guys, let's play a party game.
  Let's go stand over near Brian,
  and we'll take a drink every time he says "bonerific."
  - Bonerific? - Yeah, it's his catchphrase.
  He says it all the time.
  - Yeah, sure, I'm in. - Okay.
  Yeah, let's do it!
  Hey, hey, Brian,
  how you feeling tonight?
  Good. Having a nice time.
  Are you feeling terrific,
  or any variation on that word?
  Oh, sure. No complaints.
  My skin's a little dry.
  He's not saying it, Peter.
  What?
  No. Why would I say that? It's not even a word.
  - What isn't a word? - Bonerific.
  Did I tell you?!
  You can't keep this guy from saying it!
  Boy, great party, huh, Fred?
  Yeah. You know, Barn, I figure I ought to tell you this.
  I was walking by your house the other day,
  and, uh, I poked my head in the window
  and Betty was undressing.
  Uh, she saw me there, but she didn't stop.
  What?
  She didn't stop. I mean,
  she saw me there, looking at her and she kept undressing.
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you serious? - Yeah.
  I got an erocktion.
  I got a headache. Do you have any Anacin?
  Any what?
  - Anacin? - Yeah, Anacin.
  - Do they even make Anacin anymore? - Yeah, it's still around.
  - Why? - No, it just...
  seems like sort of a '70s medication.
  So, you don't have any Anacin?
  No.
  God, you're more worthless than Colin Farrell.
  So, uh... Got the wool cap on, huh?
  Yeah...
  Yeah, I guess, you know, whatever, it's 96 degrees out.
  Yeah, you'd better put on the old wool cap.
  Yeah.
  You got a lot going on under there, huh,
  under... under the wool cap?
  Thinking about your sideburns?
  Yeah. No, no, no, no, you're not a complete jackass.
  Oh, hey, nice T-shirt.
"Phresh"
And it's spelled with a p-h. Oh, that's fun,
'cause it's usually spelled with an "f."
Yeah.
Oh, you got a little tear in your pants, there...
Ohp, that's on purpose, though, isn't it?
Yeah, you're a bad boy.
You're a bad boy.
Society wants your pants to be intact,
but you're just not gonna listen, are you?
My God, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to kill you.
All right, one more pre-party drink, and then we'll head off to the
  Clam.
  It's cheaper to drink at your house first.
  Boy, they sure are making a lot of noise out there.
  Those idiots have done nothing but hang out
  in that stupid shed for the last two days.
  We should crash that party.
  Hey, you know what, Bernice is right.
  They're always trying to get away from us.
  We should march in there and remind them that they have wives.
  Especially if they have food, because bar food is so overpriced.
  Man, who invited Anne Frank?
  Quagmire, tell that story about the girl with the inside-out anus.
  - Oh, you mean Blossom? - Oh, that's a great story.
  All right, so I'm skulking around the intensive care unit,
  and all of sudden this smoking hot chick...
  Hey, boys! Mind if we join the party?
  Sorry, Lois, no girls allowed.
  Oh, come on, Peter. It'd be good to have some chicks in here.
  Quagmire, you nuts?
  This is a men's club.
  That's the problem. The ratio be terrible. It's a total mast-fest in
  here.
  Yeah, this is sort of lame.
  Well, we can fix that. Come on, girls, let's dance!
  Hey, hey, hey, stop it! You women can't dance in here!
  Well, I know two people who'll take my side on this.
  The stuffy parents from Dirty Dancing.
  Right, guys?
  Sorry, Peter. Even we're getting into it.
  What's the matter, Bonnie don't you want to dance?
  Oh, it's okay, Joe. I don't mind sitting here with you.
  What I mean is... I don't want to hold you back.
  Don't be silly, honey. It's just as nice watching other people have fun.
  God, I hate being handicapped.
  Sometimes I feel more useless than the head of the Maid's Union.
  And what exactly are your demands?
  We need more Lemon Pledge.
  You need more Lemon Pledge?
  Yes.
  We're not responsible for that.
  You should just bring it from your own home.
  No.
  Hello. Oh, hi, Lois.
  Yeah, last night was fun.
  Oh, it's okay, I'm used to not dancing.
  I mean, I knew what to expect after, you know, Joe's accident,
  and I'm prepared to live the rest of my life this way.
  Poor Bonnie. She deserves so much better than me.
  God, she must regret this marriage.
  If only there was some way for me to walk again.
  Wait a minute, what am I saying?
  There's nothing wrong with me. I'm no different than any other guy!
  Joe, would you put on your hand-shoes and take out the garbage?
  Thank you.
  Hey, thanks for coming with me, Peter.
  It sure would be wonderful if Dr. Hartman could help me walk again.
  I'm sorry, Mayor McCheese,
  but I'm not sure if any cosmetic surgery is even possible.
  Look, if it's a financial issue,
  It's not an issue of money, your head is a cheeseburger.
  There's no blood flow to it. It's just, it's just dead cow meat.
  All right, well, I appreciate you giving it to me straight.
  All right, then, have a tasty afternoon.
  Ah, there's a smile.
  So, what can I do for you, Mr. Swanson?
  Doc, I can't take it anymore.
  I want to walk again. I'll do what ever it takes.
  Well, there is a highly experimental new procedure.
  It's essentially a leg transplant.
  If you'd be willing to sign a waiver, I think I may be able to help you.
  You know, when you talk, you sound, a lot like my father-in-law,
  Carter Pewterschmidt.
  Oh, that's funny. He's a patient of mine.
  - Here's my urine sample, Doctor. - Thank you, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
  Oh, hi, Peter.
  You know, Peter says we sound alike.
  - Really? I don't hear it. - Actually, I think I do hear it now.
  - Really? - Yeah,
  you know, we've never really had any extended interactions,
  so I've never noticed it.
  - Hey, I think I hear it, too. - Seems lazy, doesn't it?
  Well, there's only so many voices in the world.
  Some of them are bound to be similar.
  Now, Mr. Swanson, through the magic of digital imaging,
  we'll select the legs most suited to your body from our inventory of
  donors.
  Hey, what about these?
  Ah, good choice. These are the only ones we have in stock that aren't
  hilarious.
  I'll take 'em!
  Ah, Joe. You are gonna be happier than bullfrogs on vacation in
  Ethiopia.
  Ah, this is fantastic! This is even better than they said it was in the
  brochure!
  Oh, I feel like a pig, but, come on, we're on vacation!
  Exactly, don't hate yourself, we're on vacation!
  Yeah, I hear Madonna is raising this guy's kid.
  Now, just relax, Mr. Swanson, and let the anesthetic do its job.
  - All right, Doc, I trust you. - Good.
  Now, I'll just pop in the how-to video,
  - and we'll get started. - What?!
  Hi, I'm Jamie Farr, and you're about to perform leg surgery.
  No!
  He's been in there an awful long time. I hope everything's all right.
  Gentlemen, I give you... the new Joe Swanson.
  Well, what do you think?
  - Oh, honey! - Oh, my God, you look great, Joe!
  They still got that new leg smell.
  I put his old legs in a bag if you want them.
  Oh, great. We'll take them home, we'll give them to Brian.
  Come on, Joe, I'll drive you home.
  Are you kidding?
  I've got working legs for the first time in 15 years, and I'm gonna use
  them.
  I'm walking home!
  I'm sorry, Mr. Swanson. Hospital rules, you have to leave in a
  wheelchair
  Oh, Joe, that was amazing!
  I know. I was there.
  My God, we haven't done it in so long, I had forgotten how big you were.
  I was gonna say the same thing to you.
  Coming this fall on Fox, a new reality show.
  Who Wants To Marry Corky From Life Goes On?
  You won't believe what happens!
  Come on, guys, let's go!
  Go? Where we going?
  Listen, these new legs have given me my life back.
  I want to do all the things I could never do when I was handicapped.
  And you guys are my best friends. I want you to experience it all with
  me.
  You can count on us, Joe.
  Oh, this is great! I feel so alive!
  Come on, ladies! Kick your high heels off and get moving!
  You guys are a disgrace!
  - Peter, this doesn't seem safe. - Yeah, I'm afraid I might...
  Wow. Thanks, Spider-Man.
  Everybody gets one. Tell him, Peter.
  Uh, apparently, everybody gets one.
  Bingo.
  - I don't know about this, Joe. - There is no fear in this dojo!
  Joe, we don't even know what a dojo is.
  There is no mercy in this dojo!
  Joe, why don't you take it down a notch?
  No mercy!
  All right, we're gonna do it once more.
  And this time, no mistakes!
  1, 2, 3, 4...
  Good mornin', good mornin'
  It's great to stay up late
  Good mornin', good mornin' to you
  When the band began to play The stars were shining bright
  But now the milkman's on his way It's too late to say good
  night
  - So say good mornin' - Good mornin'!
  Sunbeams will soon smile through
  Good mornin', good mornin' to you
  Nothing could be grander than to be in Louisiana In the
  mornin', in the morn...
  Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were still going.
  My God, Joe is running us ragged.
  Yeah, I haven't been this exhausted since I had that job
  as Jackee Harry's personal grocery shopper.
  A pallet?
  Am I reading this right? You need a pallet of chocolate-covered
  pretzels?
  Where the hell am I supposed to...? And what is this,
  a drum of grape jam?
  What is that? Is that like a drum like they ship oil in?
  And look at this one : "A desk of Cheez-Its."
  A desk? Where are you getting these units of measurement from?
  Mary.
  That is still funny.
  Okay, you stay right here, big funny gal. I'll be right back with...
  a "hammock of cake."
  Yeah, Dave Matthews Live. I'll burn you a copy.
  - Stay cool. - Hey, Joe. What you got there?
  Mountain bike.
  Oh, Joe, I don't know. I'm still chafed from that power walk.
  Both of my inner thighs look like those big cherry Swedish Fish.
  Don't worry. I'm not taking you pansies
  I'm taking my new friends. This is Parker, Quentin and Portland.
  - Is Portland the black one? - Portland is the black one.
  Joe, what the...
  What the hell is this?
  Well, Peter, I realized over the last few days,
  the only reason I hung out with you guys
  is that I was crippled and you were lazy.
  I decided it's time I got some friends more suited to my status.
  But, Joe, we've been friends for years.
  Hey, we all make mistakes.
  Come on, dudes, let's go exercise.
  - Exercise! - Yeah!
  I'm gonna do sit-up still I poop myself!
  I can believe it. Joe just dumped us. He's gone.
  And all we got to remember him by are his old legs.
  Okay, okay.
  Peter, I wish you'd go over there and patch things up with Joe.
  Hey, screw him, Lois.
  He doesn't need us anymore now that he's got his cool, new friends.
  I tell you, those legs have turned him into a complete jerk.
  It's like giving a monkey the keys to an amusement park.
  - How is that? - How is what?
  How is it anything like a monkey having the keys to an amusement park?
  I don't know.
  The hours would be erratic.
  Maintenance would probably suffer to some degree.
  The prizes for games of chance would all be bananas.
  Lois, don't call me on this stuff, all right?
  I'm... Just go with it. Support me in these moments.
  I'm hurt. I lost my buddy.
  Well, Peter, there have been a lot of changes in Joe's life,
  and maybe he just needed to move on.
  If I were you, I'd look for a new friend. A kindred spirit,
  like Judas found in Pontius Pilate.
  You know, sometimes I feel like someone should just...
  - Crucify Jesus of Nazareth. Oh, my God! - Crucify Jesus of Nazareth.
  Oh, my God!
  - Shut up! - No, you shut up!
  - I'm Judas. - Pontius.
  This is so weird, because just today,
  I was thinking about how I wanted to find the son of God
  and nail him to some wood.
  Well, let's go find him and kick his ass!
  That sounds swell!
  Think I'll go for a walk outside now The summer sun's calling
  my name...
  So, do you really think you're suited to be the fourth guy
  in our group, Buzz Killington?
  Yeah, I mean, we mainly just sit here in the booth and crack jokes, but
  you're kind of a buzz kill.
  Oh, on the contrary. I've quite a mastery of the humorous yarn.
  Do any of you know the tale of how corn meal came to be
  - No. - No. - No.
  Neither did the miller when he left his house that morning.
  We got to get Joe back.
  Joe, please, can't we talk about this?!
  There's nothing to talk about. I've out grown you, Bonnie.
  I need to spread my legs and fly.
  Keep the kid.
  It was awful. I mean, he just left Bonnie.
  And then the bastard completely blew me off
  to hang out with those new douche bags.
  Peter, we got to do something.
  You're right, Cleveland.
  Boys, there's only one answer.
  We got to re-cripple Joe.
  It's the right thing to do,
  like taking out Hitler.
  See? We had a plan for that all along.
  Bye, new awesome friends!
  Bonnie, I forgot my Soloflex.
  - Yo, Joe. - What the hell you doing here, pansy?
  We're gonna break your legs, Joe.
  It's for your own good.
  Come on, guys, get him!
  All right, then.
  Bonnie! What the hell?! Put my gun down!
  Not until I have my husband back!
  - Aah! My perfect ass! - Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.
  I was aiming for your spine.
  - Aah! Damn it! - Joe, I'm so sorry.
  I'm a terrible shot.
  Oh, for God's sakes, just give me the gun!
  I'll do it myself!
  Boy, we, uh, really did a number on each other.
  You know, I just want to take this opportunity to apologize to you guys.
  I was acting like a first-class jackass.
  I... hope that you can forgive me.
  Oh, it's just good to have our old Joe back.
  And once our injuries heal up, we can all go for a nice, long walk.
  All right!
  Yeah! Wait a minute!
  Joke's on you.



Title: Stewie Kills Lois

- Happy Birthday, Mom! - Oh, thank you, everybody.
  I know it's a little self-centered, but this is my favorite day of the
  year.
  Here, Mom, this is from me and Meg.
  Topol? The smoker's tooth polish?
  Take the hint.
  Happy Birthday, sweetheart.
  Lionel Ritchie's "Can't Slow Down"?
  Great album, Lois. Great album.
  I didn't know who I was until I heard this album.
  Oh, God, Lionel.
  You have been hurt.
  You have been hurt by somebody, that much is clear.
  Who hurt you?
  Who hurt you? Who hurt you?
  Who hurt you? Who hurt you?
  Oh, thank you all so much. What thoughtful gifts.
  Uh, Lois, there's one more.
  Oh, Brian, you don't have to give me anything.
  Well, give it back then.
  No, no, we have fun.
  Oh, my God!
  Two tickets for a cruise?
  Brian, this is wonderful.
  - What the hell? - Brian! - You fink!
  Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is this?
  We agreed on a $20 limit.
  We set a cap, you jerk.
  Are you trying to make us look bad, you son of a bitch?
  Peter, what are you angry about?
  You get to go on a cruise with me.
  - What? - What?
  Well, yeah, you didn't think Brian meant for me to go with him, did you?
  Great. This was a bigger waste of time than Ringo's song-writing.
  Hey, guys. I wrote a song.
  Oh, that's great.
  - Oh, good, Ringo. - Fantastic.
  You know what? I'm gonna put it... right here.
  Right on the refrigerator.
  That way we'll get to see it everyday.
  All right.
  Now, you kids behave yourselves while we're away.
  Yeah, be good till we get back, and Brian, stay out of the cat box!
  Stay out of the cat box!
  - Bye, you guys! - Bye, Mom!
  Bye, Dad!
  Farewell, Brian, I'm off to sea.
  An hour from now, I'll be surrounded by seamen.
  Sperm whales and seamen.
  Ooh, a swallow.
  Stewie, Peter and Lois aren't taking you with them.
  They've already boarded.
  Bye! Bye!
  Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye!
  Bye! Bye!
  No! No, you can't leave!
  Not without me! I'm the baby!
  Oh, I haven't been this disappointed since I saw The Lake House.
  See, the mailbox is like a time portal.
  Everything Keanu Reeves puts in there,
  Sandra Bullock gets two years later.
  Oh, my Hickory Farms package is here.
  I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to bar you
  from the aft section of the ship for the rest of the cruise.
  We are so sorry.
  Peter, what the hell did you think you were doing?
  Lois, it is called the "Poop Deck."
  That is why I pooped there.
  - You're disgusting. - And you're misleading.
  Boy, this is romantic, isn't it, Lois?
  Oh, it sure is, sweetie.
  Uh, I feel like that fat-ass British girl from Titanic.
  What girl?
  The lead in Titanic, the one opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.
  - Sweetheart, that was a guy. - What?
  That was a guy. That was Philip Seymour Hoffman.
  What? No, it wasn't.
  Yes, it was, honey. It was Philip Seymour Hoffman.
  Look at you out here on a big trip.
  What are you doing?
  I'll teach that hussy to go on a boat ride without me.
  When she returns, I'm going to put bamboo splinters
  under all her fingernails.
  Then I'm gonna strip her down and tie her to the bed.
  Okay.
  Then I'm gonna make her crawl on her hands and knees
  while I drip hot candle wax all over her back.
  Uh, and then what are you gonna do?
  Uh, let's see...
  Are you gonna shower her off after all that candle wax?
  No, I'm gonna keep her filthy.
  Yeah, she's been a bad girl.
  And then I'm gonna gag her with her own brassiere.
  - What? - No, no, nothing, nothing.
  That's all part of your diabolical plan to...
  - humiliate her. - Yes, yes, she'll be humiliated.
  Maybe you'll handcuff her? She'll hate that.
  - Then I shall do that as well! - And call her a bitch.
  Until I'm hoarse with rage!
  Maybe smack her ass with a riding crop?
  Yes, and then... What?
  No, I mean, that-that would like,
  that, that would show her.
  Are you...?
  You're getting some kind of sick sexual thrill off this, aren't you?
  Who cares? You're not gonna kill her anyway.
  You're gonna bitch and moan, and then you're gonna do what you always
  do :
  the minute Lois walks through that door, you're gonna forget all about
  it,
  beg for your apple juice, go poop and fall asleep.
  God, he's right.
  I've got the same daily routine as Dick Clark.
  Rupert, I've been all talk.
  So much time wasted.
  Well, no longer.
  Lois is a dead woman!
  I'll do to her what douche bags did to the guitar.
  This is a song I wrote last summer.
  It's called :
"Water".
My hair is growing
Growing all the time
Look how sensitive I am
'Cause my voice is so fine...
Every beer I've ever had
Is on a shelf above my bed
And sometimes I put my speakers
Facing out my window.
Peter, stop picking your teeth. We're at the Captain's table.
And that was the first time I saw the Northern Lights at their peak.
And as I gazed,
astonished, at their lustrous brilliance,
I turned to my first mate and I said,
"We are looking into the very eyes of God."
Oh, what a wonderful story.
All right, I got one for ya.
So me and Lois are driving up to Vermont to get this abortion...
- Peter! - Hang on, hang on, Lois. Don't ruin it.
All right, so we're driving up to get this abortion
and we get to the abortion clinic
and the abortionist has one hand.
- Peter, for god's... - Bah-bah. I'll tell it, I'll tell it.
So I turn to Lois and I says,
"You want to get an abortion here?"
"You want to get an abortion with the abortionist having a stump hand?"
"We can't get an abortion here."
So, we turned around and went home and two-and-a-half months later
our daughter Meg was born.
Okay, explain to me exactly what I did wrong.
Peter, that story was completely inappropriate!
Well, send me the crap to hell for being nostalgic
about the early years of our marriage.
You've totally ruined this trip for me!
I am mortified to even show my face around this ship!
Hey, the captain's the one who should be embarrassed. His story was gay.
You're gay!
Hello, Mother.
Stewie?
What the hell are you...
How did you get here?
Oh, there's a very simple answer to that.
You drove me here, Lois.
With all the indignities I've been forced to suffer
day in and day out under your matriarchal tyranny.
What are you... wh...
what are you doing with a gun?
Something I should've done a very long time ago.
I did it! I killed her!
She's dead!
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Oh, yeah, that's right.
And finally, still no word on the disappearance of Lois Griffin,
housewife and mother from Quahog
who vanished from a cruise ship six days ago.
Well folks, that's the news, and
I...
am...
outta here!
Daddy, she's been missing so long.
Do you think they'll ever find her?
God, I hope so, Meg.
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'll find her.
This is fantastic. Nobody suspects a thing.
Ooh, listen to my voice, that sounds cool.
Hellooooo!
Piiggggggssss
innnnnn
Spaaacccceeee!
Hi, Peter. Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?
What is it, Joe? Please tell me Lois is alive.
It's been six days, Peter. I'm sorry,
but we had to call off the search.
I'm afraid you're just going to have to accept the fact that..
she's gone.
No!
We now return to...
"Harrison Ford Telling Random People He Wants His Family Back."
- I want my family back! - Okay.
- Give me back my family! - Get off me!
I want my family back!
- Hey, where've you been? - Ah, I had another date.
You know, I'm glad you're finally putting yourself out there.
Lois would've wanted you to move on.
Yeah, only this one was kind of awkward.
My date was a stick figure.
So...
how would this work...
in bed.
Well, I can't do sex. But I can give you a stick job.
That a... that sounds...
Yes, it is very unpleasant.
But the freakiest was that date I had with Bonnie.
Peter...
you don't know how badly I need this.
I don't know, Bonnie, it's, it's just a little weird.
- Joe's a friend of mine. - No, it's okay.
- I promise you it's okay. - Eh, I'm not sure.
It's okay, Peter.
Just remember, whatever you do,
don't tell Chris I'm dating.
Peter, Lois has been dead for a whole year.
You're gonna have to tell him sometime.
Hi, Dad.
Did we get any mail from Mom at the health spa today?
Nope, sorry, Chris.
She said she's going straight from the spa right back to Europe.
But I haven't seen Mom since she took me back-to-school shopping.
All right, sweetie, you ready to get some new notebooks
and protractors and slacks?
- I want blue jeans. - You're getting slacks!
Here you go, Stewie.
Finish your oatmeal, and then I'll get you ready for our "Mommy and Me"
  class.
  You know, Meg has really flourished since Lois was murdered.
  What are you talking about?
  Lois's death was an accident.
  Which is just what someone who pulled off the perfect murder
  would want you to think.
  What the hell are you...?
  Stewie,
  did you...
  - Did you kill Lois? - Of course I didn't, Brian.
  Remember what you said?
  I'm all talk.
  I wouldn't possibly go through with it.
  I'll just poop and fall asleep.
  My God,
  you did it.
  You actually did it.
  Oh God, I've really screwed myself up here.
  Could you reachin to my pocket and get the number for that
  acupuncturist?
  You son of a bitch, you killed Lois.
  Good luck proving that, Brian. Seriously, that number?
  Well, I'm going to expose you for what you are.
  No matter what it takes, you are going to pay for this.
  You know, it's funny, from this position, I can hear Meg upstairs.
  I'm going to pretend you're the New York Knicks.
  Hey, put your wallets away, guys. The drinks are on me.
  Well, that's awful nice, Peter. What's the occasion?
  Lois' life insurance policy paid off.
  I got more money than Barbara Streisand.
  Honey, I'm going shopping.
  And I was going to valet park.
  I didn't know that you had life insurance on Lois.
  Did you get that right before the cruise?
  Actually, I got it on the cruise.
  Right after we had that big fight when I said,
"I wish you were dead," right before I never saw her again.
Well, see you guys later. I got to go buy hot dogs.
We keep running out for some reason.
Either of you guys think it's a little suspicious
that Peter took out a life insurance policy on Lois
right before she went missing?
You don't think...
That fat bastard murdered her, didn't he?
That son of a bitch! He's a killer, like Bernie Goetz!
You know, the subway vigilante from the eighties?
I used to do a bit about him back when I was doing standup.
Ah, what else is in the news?
Oh, oh, Bernie Goetz. Did you hear about this?
This guy Bernie Goetz shot a bunch of muggers on the subway.
Wouldn't mind having him with me next time I go see my mother-in-law.
No, but really, New York City's a great place to live...
if you're a cockroach.
- You suck! - I know.
Hey, Stewie, I found this receipt for a speedboat rental upstairs in
  your room.
  It's dated about a year ago.
  Any idea how it got there?
  Um, someone who rented a speedboat must have left it there.
  Uh-huh.
  Well, you can play innocent all you want.
  I am going to find the evidence to put you away.
  Starting by proving that you were on that cruise ship
  the night Lois disappeared.
  No, I wasn't. I was at the carnival with Rupert.
  Ah, the carnival with Rupert.
  We won! We won!
  Do it again! Now I want a pink one!
  Stewie, we've been playing for half an hour.
  Oh, okay. You want to go ride the tea bags... tea cups?
  I was hoping to keep these mementos, Rupert,
  but I can't risk it with the dog sniffing around for evidence.
  Damn! What the hell are they doing here?!
  What are we looking for, Joe?
  Well, the trail is pretty cold by now,
  but if Peter did kill Lois, we might find some clues in his garbage.
  Man, I haven't dug through these cans since Lois died.
  Can't believe it's been 12 months since I've deliberately choked myself
  by stuffing her discarded makeup sponges down my throat.
  What's wrong with you?
  Oh, my God.
  That does look like Peter's handwriting.
  There's no doubt anymore.
  Peter murdered his wife.
  This is fantastic! I'm completely off the hook!
  What the hell?
  Hey, little man, tell Chris to open his window.
  Just around the corner there's a rainbow in the sky
  So let's have another cup of coffee
  And let's have another piece of pie...
  Joe, what the hell is going on?
  You're a suspect in Lois' murder, that's what's going on!
  Don't make us go good cop, developmentally disabled cop on you.
  Um,
  we know that,
  um,
  you, um, killed Lois.
  Um,
  hello?
  Uh...
  no.
  We can, um,
  put you at the, um,
  scene where she, um, was,
  um, killed.
  Hobey's right, Peter. It doesn't look good for you.
  Joe, you got this all wrong!
  Like God did when he made Rosie O'Donnell.
  You can't put a vagina on this man!
  Why not? I'm God.
  Well, what do you want to do about the breasts?
  Ah, take a couple out of the bin we can't find matches for.
  I can't believe Dad killed Mom.
  Look, there he is!
  Dad, how could you?!
  Hey, Dad, if they put you in jail, can we go in your room?
  Look, don't you kids buy any of this for a second. Your father is
  innocent.
  Oh, he killed her.
  Just like the telephone killed the telegraph sex business.
  Hey, baby. I bet you're hot. Stop.
  Describe to me what you're doing to yourself right now. Stop.
  Oh, yeah.
  Oh, yeah...
  Oh, nasty!
  This trial is called to order.
  Defense Counsel, we will hear your opening statement.
  Hey, everybody,
  today's the big day.
  That's all, Your Honor.
  Good. Good.
  Prosecutor, call your first witness.
  Peter called me right after he killed my daughter
  - to tell me he killed my daughter. - Really?
  Well, that is interesting.
  Yes, and as a favor to the court, I've produced this simulation
  of how the killing transpired.
  I play Peter, and I hired an Asian hooker to play my daughter.
  Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid,
  and I fart at times that ruin my father-in-law's social occasions,
  and that's why I'm never invited to them.
  You pay me now?
  Chris,
  have you ever seen your father do anything bad?
  Well, now that you mention it...
  Hey, Meg.
  Proud of you!
  Mr. Griffin, do you deny killing your wife?
  Of course I deny it. I loved my wife.
  And I certainly think I'd remember killing her.
  Mr. Griffin,
  do you drink?
  I plead the fifth of Jack.
  No, no, I'm joking. Yes, I drink.
  And have you ever struck your wife?
  Only in front of the kids to assert my status as dominant male of the
  pride
  Are you a violent man?
  What are you, a wise guy?
  'Cause I know how to deal with wise guys.
  - No further questions. - You son of a bitch.
  If I had a gun on a boat, I'd shoot you.
  Mr. Foreman, how say you?
  We find Peter Griffin guilty of murder in the first degree.
  - Oh, no! - Oh, no!
  - Oh, no! - Oh, no!
  - Oh, no! - Oh, yeah!
  Okay, can I ask everyone to please stop saying, "Oh, no" in this
  courtroom?
  'Cause the ******* Kool-Aid Guy's gonna keep showing up.
  Thank you.
  Mr. Griffin,
  I hereby sentence you to life imprisonment with no possibility of...
  Lois!
  You're alive!
  - Mom, you're alive! - Oh, my gosh, Mom!
  Lois, my God, what happened? We thought you were dead!
  Mom, we thought Dad killed you!
  No, he didn't, Chris.
  But someone tried to.
  Do you remember who it was?
  Yes, I do.
  It was Stewie!



Title: Lois Kills Stewie

Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker with Channel 5 news.
  We now go live to Olie Williams
  recaping the events of the last episode of Family Guy.
  What happened last time, Ollie?
  Stewie killed Lois!
  - Then what? - Peter got blamed!
  - Then what? - Peter went to court!
  - Then what? - Lois came back!
  - How? - She wasn't really dead!
  Thanks, Ollie. And now part two.
  Oh, Lois, sweetheart, I'm so glad you're alive!
  You got to tell me everything that happened.
  I mean, not tonight 'cause I've got plans with the guys,
  but tomorrow night, I want to hear all about it.
  Peter, didn't you hear what I said?
  Stewie tried to kill me.
  Mom, Stewie's just a baby.
  No, he's not, Meg. He's evil!
  He shot me point-blank right on the deck of the cruise ship.
  I would have been dead if it hadn't been for a passing
  merman...
  who treated my wounds and carried me to safety.
  It sounds romantic, I know, but unfortunately,
  he was kind of a reverse of what you'd expect a merman to be.
  I wish to make love to you.
  Oh, uh...
  No, thank you.
  What are you talking about? I thought this was a woman's fantasy.
  Yeah, but this is sort of the opposite.
  Like if you had a man's body and fish legs, then it'd be different.
  Yeah, but then I wouldn't have a penis.
  - Well, but I... - See? There you go.
  I just poked a huge hole in your logic.
  I'm sorry. I'm just gonna have to say no.
  Maybe I feel like you owe me a little.
  Ah! Damn it!
  Unfortunately, I was suffering from total amnesia and had no
  idea who I was.
  After wandering around for a while, I discovered I was in
  North Carolina
  where I managed to get a job at a summer camp for fat kids.
  It was my job to keep the children from eating each other.
  Hey, hey! No, no...!
  Spit him out. Jeffrey, spit him out now!
  And Mike, you spit out Timmy.
  Over the next several months, I developed a relationship
  with a seemingly nice young townie named Derek.
  Eventually, he got comfortable enough with me to introduce me
  to his friends.
  That's how I found out he was a white supremacist.
  Okay, first order of business, uh, I'd like to thank Paul and Tracy,
  who have agreed to bring cookies for next week's punch social.
  Just remember, you two, Fred is allergic to peanuts.
  Peanuts and Jews!
  No, but Jews are bad.
  You know, it's remarks like that that started the Holocaust.
  And I know none of us want that to happen again.
  And after that blow to the head, it all started coming back to
  me.
  So I rushed back to Quahog, and here I am.
  So what you're saying is we've got a homicidal baby on our hands.
  Mom, Dad! Stewie's gone!
  Don't worry, Lois.We'll catch him.
  Sorry to bother you, but we have a fugitive baby on our hands.
  Have you seen this child?
  No, I haven't,officer, but I sure will keep my eyes open.
  What is it?
  That killer baby from the trial's gone missing.
  - Oh, no! - I know.
  Mr. Superman no here.
  - Well, we're lookingfor a missing... - I, I, no.
  Mr. Superman--he no is here.
  Okay, well, uh, can you just give him this flyer?
  I... No, no. I have no money.
  Just take this flyer and if you see this baby...
  No, no.
  Boy, I sure hopethey find him. Otherwise, we're all gonna be...
  So it's all out in the opennow, isn't it?
  Stewie, uh, how long you been all messed up and evil like this?
  Oh, so now you're interested in Stewie.
  Last week when I made that macaroni picture of an owl, you didn't give
  a damn!
  That was an owl?
  Yes, and now we're going to look at it again.
  - Look, look,do you like it?! - Yes.
  What do you like about it specifically?!
  I don't know.
  Pick something or I'll blow your brains out!
  I like... how it lookslike an owl.
  Thank you for the compliment!
  Hey, everything okay in there? I heard shouting.
  Dog, answer it. Tell him, "Yes,everything's fine."
  Yes, Joe, everything's fine.
  Oh, okay, good.
  Make fun ofhis wheel chair.
  What?
  - What? - Do it!
  Say, "Ha-ha-ha-ha,you're in a wheelchair."
  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,you're in a wheelchair.
  What's that supposed to mean?
  Say, "I bet you can't get a boner."
  I bet you can't get a boner.
  That's not very nice, Brian.
"Neither is your mother's ass."
Neither is your mother's ass.
Well, I'll give you that one.
Now tell him you've always thought he was handsome.
I've always thought you were handsome.
Well, I got to tell you, Brian, I'm relieved to hear you say that.
Please call me if you see any sign of Stewie.
Tell him, "Ha-ha-ha-ha, just kidding about the handsome thing."
- Oh, come on. - Do it!
Come on, that means a lot to him.
Ha-ha-ha-ha,just kidding about the handsome thing.
Ah, well, that's,uh, disappointing. I needed that boost today.
All right, I'll see you later.
All right, Lois,I'm hungry.
Take those breasts out.
Wait a minute.You could have drugged this. Well, I'm no fool. Brian,
  taste this.
  - What? - Go on. Taste it!
  You're the guinea pig!
  Lois, he's got a gun.
  Look, I'll do it myself.How about that?
  Uh, I don't know.He kind of asked me. I think we should do what he says.
  - Well, yeah, but Brian... - I'm-I'm totally willing to
  do this for the family.
  I'm not sure...
  I'll do it.
  Hey, Griffins, just checking in.
  - Holy crap! - Oh, my God!
  Stewie, you killed him! He's dead!
  Oh, my God! Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?!
  - Oh, poor Cleveland! - It's all right, Lois.
  He's in heaven now.
  I don't understand why I need to give you a credit card imprint.
  It's kind of a new policy.
  I didn't see you ask the guy in front of me.
  It's kind of brand-new.
  Do you have a credit card?
  I got a Sears card.
  Ah, they're doing pretty well, huh?
  One by my house got a Mack-Donald's right in the store.
  Won't be long before the police notice Cleveland's disappearance.
  Black man gone missing? My God, the media will be all over that.
  All right, if I see any cops following me, the dog gets it.
  Get in.
  Come on! Drive!
  Drive! Drive!
  Ooh, there's Joe. Say, "Joe, I think you're cool."
  Joe, I think you're cool.
  Well, thank you, Brian. That's gonna get me through the rest of this
  yard work.
"No, just kidding.You suck."
No, just kidding. You suck.
"Queer".
Queer
Ah, well, there goes my smile.
You know, you're not gonna get away with this.
Kidnapping me is one thing, but you killed Cleveland.
You forget I'm the one holding the gun, Brian,
and you're gonna do exactly as I say.
You mind if I ask where we're going?
You'll know soon enough,Brian.
The world will know soon enough.
I'll be as big as I should have been when I was on American Idol.
Stewie, what the hell was that?
That was "Lost in Your Eyes" by Debbie Gibson.
One of the worst I've ever heard.
Okay.
Stewie, you shouldn't actually even be alive, you sniveling little
  creep.
  I hate you so much I want to shoot you in your face.
  All right.
  Honey, I like you, but you're just not right for this competition.
  Yo, dawg, I got to tell you for me, man, that was not even half good,
  dude.
  You can't sing. What're you doing, Stewie?
  I don't even care! They don't know what they's talkin' 'bout!
  Next time they hear 'bout me, they, they's gonna be, like,
"We was wrong about Stewie," cause I's gonna be huge.
I's gonna be bigger than every one of all y'alls.
Hey, hey, you know what we should do, guys, while we're here tied up
  like this?
  What?
  We should come up with a totally bogus rumor about a celebrity.
  And then when we get outta here, we'll spread it around as much as we
  can.
  That sounds like fun.
  Actually, that does sound like fun. What'd you have in mind?
  Okay, okay, how about this?
  Hey, did you guys hear about Rob Schneider?
  Somebody told me he goes down to Home Depot
  and pays the migrant workers to go to his house
  and choke him in the shower.
  I could buy that. That sounds like something he'd do.
  Well, I think that's awful that Rob Schneider does that.
  Yeah, isn't that a disgusting absolute fact?
  Yay! We're starting a rumor!
  Wait a minute. Chris, are you clapping?
  Yeah.
  So your hands are free?
  Yeah.
  Stewie didn't tie up your hands?
  No, he must have forgot.
  You realize we've been sitting here for 14 hours?
  Well, get pissy if you want, Mom. I've enjoyed the time we've had as a
  family.
  What is it? What did you do?!
  You almost shot me, you son of a bitch!
  That's because you yelled.
  No, you shot the gun first. That's why I yelled.
"That's why I yelled..."
I'm watching you, buddy.
There's got to besome clue in here that'll tell us where Stewie might
  have gone.
  Wow! Look at all this cool stuff!
  Man, what do you think these things do?
  Huh! Guess it doesn't do anything.
  Well, that seems odd.
  Oh, my God!Peter, you're me!
  Holy crap!
  Ah! Sweet!
  Squeeze, squeeze.
  All right, pull in here.
  The CIA? What the hell are we doing here?
  You'll need CIA credentials, Brian.
  What do you want your alias to be?
  - What are you talking about? I'm not gonna go... - Pick a name for
  yourself!
  - Willem Dafoe. - Ooh! Not that one.
  I used to have a Willem Dafoe living under my bed.
  Hey. You're asleep yet?
  No.
  Just checking.
  What, exactly, are you looking for?
  According tom y schematics, it should be right in here.
  This is it, Brian! My plan for world domination is about to come to
  fruition.
  Stewie, for God's sake,th What are you trying to do?!
  Once I locate the proper code sequence, this terminal will allow me
  to take command of the satellites which control the world's power grid.
  Once they're under my control, the entire world will be subject to my
  whims.
  Go away, you paper clip! No one likes you!
  Open up in there or we're breaking down the door!
  - I love you, Katie. - I love you, too, Tom.
  Oh, my God! I'm free!
  The force field is down! Go now!
  I'd drop the gun if I were you, Joe.
  - What? It's Stan. - Oh. Sorry, You look sort alike someone from...
  Anyway, I'd drop the gun if I were you.
  I now control the entire planet's power grid,
  and unless you want me to send you all back to the Dark Ages,
  you'll do exactly as I say.
  What are your demands?
  We interrupt this program to bring you a special message
  from the new president of the world.
  Greetings, loyal minions.
  Stewie?!
  - Oh, my God! - What the hell?!
  Good gravy!
  Señor Rob Schneider! You must come see the news!
  I'm not paying you guys to watch TV. Now, get in the damn shower!
  Oh, Brian, come here.
  I want you to hear my presidential address for Saint Rupert's Day.
  I'm unveiling all the new laws I've passed.
  Screw off.I don't want anything to do with you or your damn laws.
  Oh, just take a look, will you?
  You're banning straight-to-video Disney films?
  Absolutely.I mean, look at this.
  Aladdin 4: Jafar May Need Glasses.
  Number one.Number two.
  Number one.Number two.
  Um... about the same. Number one mightbe a tiny bit better.
  Number three.Number four.
  Number three.
  Five... and six.
  Five... and six.
  About the same?
  Yeah. They're pretty much... Can I see five one more time?
  Five... and six.
  Yeah, they're about the same.
  Greetings, unwashed masses.
  The following laws will go into effect immediately.
  From this day forward,all the nation's milk must come from Hilary
  Swank's breasts.
  Hey, I don't give a damn what you want! Just get the hell off of my
  property!
  Look, Hilary, all I know is it's breakfast time, I've got this bowl of
  Corn Flakes,
  and I gotta beat work at at 9:00 So what are we going to do here?
  Not so fast.Did you know you'd have to eat 17 bowls of those Corn Flakes
  to get the same nutritional value in one bowl of Total?
  Say, that's a lot easier than eating 17 bowls.
  And it's easier on my breasts!
  Everybody wins!
  Hilary Swank Get your milk from her.
  Yeah!
  Also, as I've had quite enough of the fat man,
  anyone who sees Peter Griffin must throw apples at him.
  Yeah, I'd like to make a deposit.
  - What the hell?! - It's the law, sir.
  And, finally, anyone who uses the terms "irregardless," "a whole
  'nother"
  or "all of the sudden" shall be sent to a work camp.
  That is enough!
  Peter, I am not going to stand by
  while other people suffer at the hands of my own baby.
  I brought Stewie into this world. It's time for me to take him out!
  How the hell are you gonna do that?
  - Sorry, Dad! - That's okay, Chris.
  You're a good boy,following the law.
  But you, Meg,you're going to jail.
  All right, Peter.I'm going to kill Stewie.
  Dinner's in the oven. All you have to do is
  turn it to 350 at about 5:15.
  Yeah, okay, Lois.
  - Are you listening? - Yeah.
  What did I just say?
  Turn the oven to 350at 5:15. I heard it!
  - All right, sir. Your presidential portrait is finished. - Let me see.
  Ah! Excellent.
  Much better than the one Gary Larson did.
  Why would I even be talking to a chicken?
  Lois!
  Stewie's terror has come to an end!
  I will not stand by while you make innocent people suffer!
  Bring it on, bitch!
  Time for me to finish what I started anyway.
  Go ahead, Lois. Do it.
  Shoot me. Shoot your little baby Stewie.
  I can't do it. You're a terrible,evil child, but you're still my
  baby,and
  I could never hurt you.
  Well, that works out perfectly because I can hurt you!
  Say hi to Cleveland for me.
  Oh, and Mr. Weed.
  It's just been revoked!
  Uh... Peter, he didn't really set you up for that Lethal Weapon line.
  It... it doesn'treally work here.
  Oh.
  I'll have what she's having!
  That's... better?
  SIMULACION FINALIZADA
  Hey, Stewie,we got a postcard from Peter and Lois on the cruise.
  What are you doing?
  Oh, hello, Brian. Well, you recall my complaining
  about Lois and the fat man not taking me with them?
  Yeah.Yes.
  Well, you said I didn't have it in me to kill Lois,
  so I was just running a simulation to find out exactly
  how killing her and taking over the world would play out for me.
  Yeah? How did that go?
  Not well, Brian. Not well.
  I suppose I'm not ready to kill Lois or take over the world...
  yet.
  So, what you're saying is that what you experienced in the simulation
  didn't really happen or even matter.
  Yes. That's correct.
  So it was sort of like a dream.
  No. It was a simulation.
  Yes, but theoretically, if someone watched the events
  of that simulation from start to finish,
  only to find out that none of it really happened,
  I mean, you don't think that would be just like a giant middle finger
  to them?
  Well hopefully, they would have enjoyed the ride.
  I don't know, man. I think you piss a lot of people off that way.
  Well, at least it didn't end like The Sopranos,
  where it just cut to black in midsent-



Title: Padre De Familia

Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.
  And I'm Diane Simmons, reporting live
  from the 35th annual Quahog Veteran's Day celebration.
  And here comes the parade.
  First up, a float from the Veterans of Future Wars.
  And here comes whackadoo film director Oliver Stone.
  Oliver's here promoting his new movie
  Born on the Fourth of July II:
  Born on the Fifth of July,
  which he promises will be even "July-ier"
  than the original.
  A dangerously insane human being.
  And here comes the next float, honoring uninjured veterans.
  - We rock! - Our wives stayed with us!
  - Think fast! - We did!
  Mom, how come, when we see these guys on the street corner,
  you tell me not to stare a and today that's all we're doing?
  Because Chris, as Americans,
  we owe our lives to these veterans.
  Hey, look, Lois. The John McCain Experience.
  I want to be president!
  Mais qu'est ce que c'est ? What is that?
  And I'm proud to be an American
  Where at least I know I'm free
  And I won't forget the men who died
  Who gave that right to me
  And I'll gladly stand up
  Next to you and defend
  her still today
  Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
  God bless the U.S.A.
  Oh, my God. That was beautiful.
  I am proud to be an American,
  and I am going to love my country like never before.
  Anybody want to see my Purple Heart?
  We now return to Superman V: The Broken Condom.
  - Hey, Lois, ready to go to dinner? - Yeah, sure, just let me grab my
  purse.
  Okay, ready.
  Ooh, on second thought, I got something I got to do back on Krypton.
  - I thought Kryptonwas destroyed. - I think we should see other people.
  Good morning, my American family.
  Peter, where did you getthat suit?
  My God, you look like the Statue of Liberty's pimp.
  This is how a patriot dresses, Lois.
  Boy, I never knew it would feel this good to love my country.
  It's like loving God or a stepparent.
  You never really feel them love you back, but
  that's okay because
  they got other stuff going on, and you understand.
  Peter, you do realize there's a difference between
  loving America and being swept up
  dans la parano post 9/11.
  Brian, are you suggesting that 9/11 didn't change everything?
  - What? No, I was just... - Because 9/11 changed everything, Brian.
  9/11 changed everything.
  Peter, you didn't even know what 9/11 was until 2004.
  Peter, what the hell are you doing?
  Lois, I am doing my duty as a patriotic American.
  I'm sacrificing a goat to Toby Keith.
  Peter, Toby Keith doesn't want to be fed.
  Toby Keith wants to hunt.
  Hey, listen, don't tell me what Toby Keith wants.
  I think I'm perfectly capable...
  You're all doing such a great job,
  I wanted to play youa song I wrote
  about what America means to me.
  When you say U.S.A.
  I just say hooray
  And if you're not from here
  God's gonna hunt you down and give you AIDS
  U.S.A.
  Wow, Peter, you're really becoming quite the patriot.
  You bet I am.
  I just had my penis tattooed to look like the space shuttle
  and my nads tattooed to look like launch exhaust.
  That bastard! That was my idea; he stole it.
  I was going to do that to my penis.
  Oh, well, maybe I can do something else
  like-like... like the Space Needle
  or a banana...
  or a Sharpie.
  Ah, I'm boring myself.
  Guess I'll listen to some music.
  Man, that reallymakes me mad--
  illegal immigrants coming into this country,
  taking all the good jobs away from Americans.
  Well, I am goingto make sure people like that
  stay out of Quahog from now on.
  We are going to patrol the borders
  and keep this townas clean as a Jewish porno.
  I own four apartment buildings.
  I have central air.
  And a well-funded 401(k).
  Oh... we are going to have sex at some point.
  All right, guys, it's going to be a long night of border patrol,
  so I brought along Michael McDonald to help us out.
  How's he going to help us?
  He's going to do backup vocals for everything we say.
  How's he gonna know what we're saying? - How's he gonna know
  what we're saying
  - Is he gonna do it for all of us? - Is he gonna do it for all
  of us?
  Yeah, I hired him for the night. He costs like $250 an hour,
  - so don't skimp on the conversation. - So don't skimp on the
  conversation.
  That sounds nice.
  Peter, why did you have my acupuncturist arrested?
  Because he was an illegal immigrant
  and a threat to our national security.
  He was an 85-year-old Korean Buddhist.
  Or was he supreme leader of al-Qaeda?
  I guess we'll find out if he ever gets a trial.
  Peter, America was founded by immigrants.
  Everyone here is the descendant of an immigrant.
  They're a vital part of our society.
  They are part of theRebel Alliance and a traitor.
  Take them away.
  Peter, have you seen Stewie's Speedy Gonzales video?
  He won't go tosleep without it.
  - I threw it away. - What?!
  What the hell, man?! I don't throw away your stuff.
  - And where's my goat? - Peter, why would you do that?
  Because Speedy Gonzales is an immigrant
  and a bad influence on our children,
  so I created his Americanequivalent
  Rapid Dave.
  - I got you now, mouse. - Yeah?
  Well, up your ass, cat. Quickly, quickly,quickly, run fast!
  Run fast, quickly!
  Hey, Fuad, can I buy you a cup of coffee?
  Oh-ho-ho, yes!
  Is funny because is free.
  - Anyone can have. - That's right.
  - That's the joke. - Oh... yes.
  Why, you son of a bitch.
  - Angela, I have a complaint. - What is it, Griffin?
  I think Fuad is an illegal immigrant,
  and I cannot stand by while he steals wages
  and opportunities from citizens.
  I mean, this is an American company.
  You don't see Nike or Microsoft or General Motors
  or Ford or Boeing or Coca-Cola or Kellogg's
  profiting from non-American labor.
  Is funny because they all do.
  You have a point, Griffin.
  Maybe we should run a company-wide check
  to make sure all our personnel are legal citizens.
  Now you're talking, Angela.
  This country needs more immigrants
  like my cousin, Peter the pig, needs a new house.
  Uh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
  - What? - I said, I wouldn't do that.
  - I said knock it off! - Why?
  Because I just made stool in there,
  and if you blow it down, the whole woods is gonna stink.
  Do you understand?
  Do you understand me, sir?
  Peter, what brings you here?
  Hi, Mom.
  Hey, uh, there'sa new policy at work
  where everyone has to prove they're an American,
  and I need my birth certificate.
  Oh. Oh, dear.
  Peter, sit down.
  I don't know how to tell you this,
  but you weren't born in America.
  You were born in Mexico.
  - What?! - When I found out
  that your real father was a drunken Irishman,
  I went to Mexico to terminate my pregnancy.
  But God had other plans,
  and you were born right there.
  You were so beautiful, and I loved you.
  But when I got back home,
  I was so afraid of being judged by the community
  that I never filled out the paperwork to make you a citizen
  Mom... what are you saying?
  Peter, as far as the US government is concerned,
  you're an illegal Mexican immigrant.
  Holy crap!
  Looks like I've got myself in a bind.
  How will I get out of this one?
  Stick around,
  'Cause we've got Cleveland And Quagmire,and Joe, and Mort
  And all your cartoon pals...
  Peter, how come you're not at work?
  I got fired for being an illegal immigrant.
  Oh, dear.
  You know, Peter, you can always take a citizenship test.
  I mean, if Wilmer Valderrama passed, it can't be that difficult.
  Well, by that logic, Lois,
  it can't be that difficult to nail Lindsay Lohan
  I don't think it is.
  Well, good news there.
  All right, you want to head down to the INS?
  So, give me the good news-- did I pass?
  I'm afraid it doesn't look good for you, Señor Griffin.
  So far, you've failed everything,
  including the "Behaving like an American at the airport" test.
  No, it wasn't bad.
  Yeah, I'm on the way to the next plane now.
  Yeah, I got a middle seat, so I'm gonna see if I can switch.
  Ooh, a Subarro.
  I'm gonna get a big, fat piece of pizza
  so I got something to stuff in my face
  while I'm reading USA Today.
  The only thing remaining is the oral test,
  which I will administer here.
  Now, question number one, "Who discovered America?"
  - Dick York? - No.
  Dick Sargent. It was Dick Sargent.
  Question number two, complete this sentence:
"The land of the free and the home of the blank."
- Home of the Whopper? - You've got to be kidding me.
Mr. Griffin, if you were truly an American, you would know our national
  anthem.
  Now, wait a minute, he is too an American.
  We've been married for almost 20 years.
  Well, we hear that one a lot around here.
  Of course there's a very easy way of detecting fraud.
  Mr. Griffin, what is your wife's birthday?
  Uh... eh... Gim-gim-gimme another one, gimme another one.
  Where is your wife's hometown?
  Uh... uh, uh,one more, one more.
  What is your wife's favorite outdoor activity ?
  Uh, things an overcoat would say.
  Um, I'm covered with water.
  - Things an umbrellawould say. - I'm-I'm...you wear me.
  Uh, uh, uh, things a festive bow tie would say.
  You wear me to keep you dry.
  Uh, uh, things Speed Stick would say.
  - I keep your head dry. - I said umbrella.
  It's not umbrella.
  Peter, what if I said
  I keep your head dry, you wear me in the bathroom?
  Shower cap.
  - There you go. - Oh, man.
  - Did you have fun? - I had fun, yeah.
  All right, we'll be back after this.
  Peter, what are you gonna do without a job?
  We can't just keep eating into savings.
  I'll just have to find a job for an illegal immigrant.
  I can't believe this is happening to our family.
  It's taken us all by surprise, Meg.
  Like that realistic original ending to Dirty Dancing.
  Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
  I do, because I'm her father and she's 16.
  - What are you, like 38? - Forty-one.
  With these
  Hungry eyes.
"Hotel maid wanted." Ah, sweet, I could do that.
Housekeeping.
- Housekeeping. - Come back later, please.
- Housekeeping? - Not now.
- Housekeeping! - Go away.
- I come in anyway? - No. Go away.
I come in anyway.
- Oh, my God! - I said no!
- Okay, I clean? - No! Get out of here!
- I clean now? - No!
- I stay and watch? - No!
- I get involved? - What?
I get involved with lady?
- What doyou think? - Turn around.
- I don't think so. - Okay.
- You lend me money? - No.
You drive my grandmother to doctor's appointment?
- No! No, I'm not doing that. - I stick finger in your mouth?
Housekeeping?
- Okay. - Okay.
"Nanny wanted."
Well, that sounds like a good job for an immigrant.
Michael, did you hear the good news?
We're getting a new nanny.
Oh, Jane, I'm ever so excited.
Do you suppose she'll be everything we've dreamed?
Oh, I do hope so.
I've always imagined the most beautiful...
Damn it!
Oh, Peter, you look exhausted.
I am, Lois.
Life as Mexican immigrant is brutal.
Even after seven jobs and joining Menudo,
I only made 25 bucks.
Now look, don't get upset,
but I've been so worried about you that I asked someone for help.
- Who? - Hello, fat ass.
Lois, immigrants don't take handouts.
They just takeone DVD a month from the house they're cleaning
until they have a respectable collection.
It's not a handout, it's a job.
Daddy employs lots of immigrants,
and he said you could work at the mansion.
Really?
Well, thanks lot, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
I promise I won't let you down.
Well, they all do eventually.
Except for Noriega. God bless him and his drug money.
I wish he were here today.
Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Oh, look who it is! Come hereso I can give you a hug.
Come here so can give you a hug.
- Ah, there they are. - Hi, Mom.
Hi grandma.
- Grandma. - I've missed you.
Peter, I'm using you as a house immigrant,
so take my family's luggage to their rooms
and then go get settled down at the servants quarters.
Right away, Mr. Pewterschmidt, sir.
Daddy, we don't want any special treatment.
We're here as a family, and we're gonna live as a family.
Are you serious?
We come to a mansion, and you want to live with the help?
Ugh, that's like going to a strip club on a Tuesday afternoon.
Is there anyone here who hasn't had a C-section?
Oh, no, that boy's ball fell out of the cup.
Oh, but it's okay
because the ball is on a string and attached to the cup.
Hola! You must be the Griffins.
I am Gerardo, the head groundskeeper.
You must be exhausted.
Come, come, let's get you to your new home.
Hey, Senorita!
You got nice bread dough legs!
I got a blank prescription pad!
See, this isn't so bad.
Not so bad?
We're sharing a toolshed with seven other families.
They're making the best of it.
Good morning, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
It's 8:00 and I'm ready for work.
Good. Have a seat. Drink that.
- What is it? - My blood.
I'm a diabetic, and I need you to test it.
- Isn't that dangerous? - I don't know. Probably.
- I don't want to. - You work for me.
- Now, drink it. - No.
Drink my diabetic blood, Peter, or you're fired.
Aw! I can't believe you really did that.
Aw, that's nasty. You're nasty.
Peter! How was your first day?
Horrible. I never worked so hard in my life.
How the hell do you guys do this every day?
Immigrant life sucks.
But, Peter, life in America is wonderful.
That is why we risk everything to come here.
I don't know, Cheech. It seems like a lot of work for no respect.
Peter, America is theland of opportunity.
There are tall buildings, cheeseburgers
and Fox's many hit comedy series,
including That '70s Show,
and, uh...
But let me ask you something: Don't you missyour home?
Of course.
We come to America for financial opportunities, Peter,
but someday we will return to Mexico
because our heritage is rich and glorious.
Wait-wait, hang on a second.
Are you saying there's more to being Mexican
than working hard and lusting after big asses?
There is, Peter.
In fact, we are preparing our Cinco de Mayo celebration.
As a Mexican, you must experience it with us.
Well, kids, enjoy yourselves.
Cinco de Mayo is as Mexican as it gets.
Wow, this is awesome!
And later, I'm gonna go lift free weights in a parking lot!
Oh, Peter, I'm so proud
that you've embraced these people as your own.
You've come a long way from hating foreigners.
Well, Lois, life can surprise you if you open your mind a little.
For example, I used to hate the Japanese,
but then I saw Lou Diamond Phillips in Young Guns
and now I don't hate them anymore.
Peter, I don't think that Lou Diamond Phillips is Japanese.
Eh, Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees, look at these.
Hey, what do you say we get some of them burritos?
Oh, muñequita.
I would love to feel your mustache on my mustache.
Really?
Well, there's a lot more body hair where that came from.
Oh, well, then no, thank you.
What the hell is going on here?
Why aren't you people working?
It's Cinco de Mayo, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Look, I don't care what day it is Mexico,
in America we work on weekdays.
Now, do your jobs
or I'll deport your lazy asses back to the Third World.
Wait a minute, hang on, everybody.
What he just said does not represent the America that I know and love.
This country used to welcome our kind with open arms.
But men like Carter Pewterschmidt use us for cheap labor,
and then-and then try to punish us
when we demand to be treated like human beings.
Well, no more!
Immigrants built this country,
and I say it's time for us to take it back!
Who's with me?!
Could you say whole speech again in Spanish?
What the hell is that?
Get out, the way, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
We are here to take what's ours.
Well, I mean, technically it's yours, but
we don't feel like you deserve it,
so, we're calling it ours and taking it anyway.
But, Peter, why would you want to harm a fellow American citizen?
- What?! - All I have to do is
make one call to friend of mine in Washington,
and he can push your paperwork through.
You'll officially be an American citizen.
Not good enough, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
I want citizenship for everyone here.
Peter, you do not have to do this.
Yes, I do, Gerardo.
This great land should be everything to you that it is to me.
A land where a man is paid a wage he can live on.
A land where we flush every time.
A land where 17 miles is not walking distance.
A land where meals are not purchased from a truck
and then eaten in a different truck.
All right, all right, you make your point.
It's getting a little offensive.
That's my only offer. Take it or leave it.
Peter, you must go.
We will find our own way.
I'll never forget you, Gerardo.
Boy, I sure am gonna miss Reynaldo.
But I'm glad I'm finally an American again.
Being an immigrant is areal pain in the ass.
I'm glad too, Peter.
But I did enjoy learning about another culture.
Yeah, you know, so did I.
Well, I guess everything's back to normal.
Oh, man, not this guy again.
Fa-art!



Title: Peters Daughter

Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker
  with a Channel Five News Special Report.
  And I'm Diane Simmons.
  A flash flood warning is in effect
  as rain continues to pound Rhode Island.
  Let's go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa,
  Who's gonna tell us all about the rain.
  Tom, residents all over Quahog
  have been affected by the heavy rains,
  although some are doing their best to ride it out.
  For example, I'm here with
  Rides-a-Ten-Speed- Everywhere Guy.
  Sir, why are you riding your ten-speed in the rain?
  I don't mind-- a little drizzle never hurt anybody.
  I like riding the ten-speed because it's fun,
  it gives me energy, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
  What do you do for a living?
  I work in accounts receivable at Quahog Insurance.
  Uh, it's not too demanding, the pay is good,
  and it's a great way to stay in shape.
  Well, we should wrap this up-- you're getting wet.
  I'm living life before the cancer I have
  kills me so I don't mind the rain.
  Water feels good on my skin. It's cool, refreshing,
  and it's a great way to stay in shape.
  - What kind of cancer? - It's rectal cancer.
  It's slowly eating away at my lower insides.
  It's a quick process, both painful and untreatable,
  and it's a great way to stay in shape.
  Thank you, Tricia. Some local residents
  have even been evacuated to Quahog Stadium
  for their own protection.
  - Why do I have to stay here? - We just think you'll be safer.
  - But my house is dry. - Here's a blanket.
  If you're looking for a bathroom, it's all around you.
  Oh, crap, Peter, it's a flash flood!
  Oh, man, I better save my autographed picture of Dean Cain!
  You know, from before he got all desperate for attention.
  Hey, is that Dean Cain on that park bench?
  Oh, God!
  Lois! Uh, you may want to come down here!
  - Oh, my God! - I know--about the water, right?
  Wow! Cool!
  - Hey, Chris, come here. - What? Why?
  Just come here.
  What is it, Dad?
  Does it feel like the water suddenly just got warmer?
  That's right, it's pee that makes it warmer.
  Peter, the water's rising fast! We got to get out of here!
  Hang on, Lois. There's a case of beer in the fridge.
  I can't leave that behind!
  Meg, you're a goodswimmer-- go get it.
  What?! But, Dad...
  And for God's sake,do not be afraid
  to make me a sandwich while you're in there.
  Peter, Meg's been in there a long time.
  Boy, you cannot wait to criticize her at every turn, can you?
  Go get her!
  Well, Lois, I am sorry for snapping at you earlier;
  You were right to critizise Meg.
  She could not even handle this simple task.
  She's in there right now taking a nap underwater.
  For God's sake, save her!
  My God, we better get her to a hospital. She doesn't look too good.
  Yes, she looks worse than Andy Garcia when he had his conjoined twin.
  I had a great time with you tonight. You're really amazing.
  Thanks, Andy. I had a great time, too.
  How about some love for shoulder guy over here?
  Shoulder guy wants to get in on this.
  - Just ignore him. - Okay...
  So, do you maybe want to go in the other room?
  Sure. Sounds good.
  And shoulder guy's going with ya.
  - Rick, shut up. - Hey, bitch, want to suck on my tooth?
  Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid your coma's in a daughter.
  I mean... I mean, your daughter's in a coma!
  What... Oh, my God,did you...
  did you hear what I said?
  Brain freeze!
  Oh, my God!
  That one's going in the Christmas letter.
  Oh, my God, Peter,
  - what if she doesn't come out of it? - I know, Lois.
  I never realized until now how much I've taken her for granted.
  I mean, she's my only daughter, and I
  feel like I've never treated her as well as I should've.
  Hey, Meg, you got something on you shirt.
  Hi, Dad.
  Aw, don't be too hard on yourself, Peter.
  We all do things that we're not proud of.
  Well, I am gonna change.
  You hear me, Meg? If you come out of this,
  I am gonna treat you like a princess for the rest of your life.
  'Cause I been a worse father than Abraham.
  You want to tell me what the ... that was?
  Excuse me, I'm Dr. Milano. I'm the intern for this floor.
  You know, you guys can probably go on home.
  We let you know if there's any change in your daughter'scondition.
  Wow, you'rea real doctor?
  Hey, does Scrubs work here? I love that guy.
  I want to meet Scrubs, and I want to meet black Scrubs, too.
  Well, hello, sleepyhead. I'm Michael.
  Hi, Michael.I'm Meg.
  - Meg! - Oh, my God! Meg, you're OK !
  Oh, Meg, my beautiful daughter!
  Oh, thing sare gonna be different.
  No more will I treat you like some kind of alien.
  Three minutes to minimum safe distance.
  Stop. Not so fast, y'all.
  You think you can just up and run away, you crazy.
  I like to eat people from other planets,
  especially y'all.
  I likes to eat you with my little mouth, too.
  Oh, now, y'all get back up inside me, little mouth.
  I wants to play, too.
  Get back inside-- I'll get you when we's eatin' em.
  - So, what is ityou wanted to show me? - That, Brian.
  What? It's a rundown old house.
  Well, yes, I-I suppose to the untrained eye
  that's what it would look like. Walk inside with me, Brian.
  This is disgusting--it smells, it's falling apart,
  and you can hear the mice humping in the wall.
  That was so awesome!
  That's why we can get it for a steal, Brian.
  We fix it up and sell it for a huge profit!
  You're crazy. No, I'm not gonna buy this house with you.
  Fine, I'll just give the profits to another investor.
  - Plenty of others interested. - Oh yeah, like who?
  Mort Goldman, for one.
  Says it's a smart investment. But what does he know?
  He's only Jewish.
  All right, I'm in.
  Oh, there's my little angel!
  Here, let me get that for you, sweetie.
  Thanks, Dad!
  Wow, Peter, I got to say,
  you've really been true to your word about treating Meg better.
  She's my only daughter, Lois.
  She needs to be protected, like a rare gemstone,
  or the herniated scrotum of an older gentleman.
  Well, I think you've been wonderful.
  Like when you took her to that new movie,
  I'm Rich and You're Poor, but Let's Dance Together.
  I'm rich and you're poor, but let's dance together.
  - Society won't like it. - I don't care.
  Good for you, good for you.
  Yeah, and I can't believe
  how you stood up to Connie D'Amico for me.
  - Hey, Meg. - Uh, hi, Connie.
  I can't fit all my booksin my locker.
  Can I put the rest of them on your giant enormous ass?
  Hey, Connie, hi. Peter Griffin,Meg's father.
  Say, uh, can you do me a favor?
  You see that fire extinguisher there?
  Dad, that'senough!
  Dad, that's enough!
  That'senough, Dad!
  I just want youto know, Meg, if there's anythingyou ever want,
  - all you got to do is ask. - Really?
  Well, there kind ofis one thing.
  There he is now!
  Hey, Meg.You ready to go?
  Dad, you remember MichaelMilano, from the hospital.
  He's my date.
  Say, Michael, can you do me a favor?
  You see that fire extinguisher there?
  Stay away from my daughter, you possible rapist.
  Dad, stop it. Michael's my date.
  Meg, I almost lost you once, I'm not gonnalose you again.
  This guy may look harmless on the outside,
  but on the inside he could be a complete bastard,
  like Fred Flintstone.
  So, why exactly do you want this separation?
  Well, Mr. Stoneberg, in a nutshell, the cat put me outside,
  I was bangin' on the door for like 20 minutes, shouting "Wilma!"
  I didn't hear you.
  Oh, there's no way you didn't hear me.
  I was in the shower.
  Oh, she was in the shower.
  The elephant's trunkwas on full blast. I couldn't hear you.
  - And besides, you're always - All you do is spend my money
  - on expensive clothesand hairdos. - when to pay attention?
  But when I want to get my rocksoff, you're nowhere to be found
  you passive-aggressive bitch.
  Meg, can I talk to you in the kitchen, please?
  Dad, what the hell?
  Lois, did you know that Meg had a date?
  Yes. With that nice boy from the hospital.
  - What's the matter? - We don't know him.
  Maybe he's not even a boy.
  Maybe he's two dwarves in an overcoat
  wanting to see what sex is like with a big person.
  Is that what you want?
  Two crafty dwarves in your house, after your daughter--
  wait, do dwarves grant wishes?
  No, Peter, they're people, like you and me.
  Well, good-bye phonein the bathroom,
  but I still don't like Meg dating that boy.
  Guy-guy-guy's that age, all they care about is
  putting their thing in everything.
  I'm not gonna let Meg turn out like my Nerf football in the hall closet.
  Dad, didn't you say you'd give me whatever I wanted?
  Well, I want to go out with Michael.
  Peter, you're being overprotective.
  Look, why don't youjust talk to him? You might find outhe's not so bad.
  All right, Lois, but I know what my gut tells me.
  And right now it's telling me I have...
  Indigestion.
  But I'll suck it up and talk Michael. en though I've also go...
  Diarrhea.
  So, you are here to take out my daughter.
  What are your intentions?
  I just think Meg is really cool, and I want to get to know her better.
  You know, Michael,my daughter's womb
  is not a wild firefor you to douse with your adolescent seed.
  - I understand. - Do you, Michael? Do you?
  We'll see. Let me ask you a question.
  You ever sit on your arm till it falls asleep,
  and then play with yourself and pretend like somebody else is doing it?
  Honestly... yes.
  Not anymore you don't.
  'Cause you're going out with my daughter.
  Morning, Brian. Here, put this on.
  - How long have you been here? - 7:00 a.m.
  All right, here's your hammer, here's your walkie,
  and here's your stud finder.
  Oh. Oh, well, it's working.
  All right, joke time is over. Work time has begun.
  You get started with this dry wall
  and I'm gonna start pulling out those old floorboards in the kitchen.
  Hey, Brian, knock, knock.
  Who's there?
  Two friends building a house together.
  Hey, Meg, I, uh, got you something for our three-week anniversary.
  Wow, a Maroon 5 CD.
  Yeah, I remember how you told me you liked terrible music,
  - so I thought you might appreciate it. - You're so thoughtful.
  - Wh-what the hell? - What's wrong?
  Uh, Meg, I'm not sure, but I think
  dad is sitting at that table over there.
  What? Where?
  Well, I-I can't tell if it's him.
  I think he's wearing some kind of disguise.
  Oh, my God, Dad.
  - What do you think you're doing? - Peter? Who Peter?
  I didn't say "Peter." I said "Dad."
  Have you been spying on us the entire time we've been dating?
  Meg, it's only because I want to make sure this guy
  treats you right and doesn't try anything funny.
  Meg, this is more than I can deal with.
  If your father is this opposed to our relationship,
  I don't see how it can work out.
  - But, Michael... - I'm sorry, Meg.
  I promise I won't forget you.
  See, look, Meg, he just walked out on you. He's a bad man.
  Like Jodie Foster.
  Oh, no, Jodie! It's my husband!
  He's home from work early!
  Don't worry, baby. He had to findout sometime.
  All right, Brian, I'm going to go up to the upper level
  and run this wire down through the wall.
  Grab your walky I'll call you when I get up there.
  - Brian, pick up. Over. - What?
  Brian, please say over when you've finished talking. Over.
  What? Over.
  - Do you see the wire yet? Over. - No.
  No... what? Over.
  No. Over.
  Okay, I'm going to start feeding it through. Over.
  Wait, if you haven't started feeding it, why'd you ask me if I could
  see it?
  Didn't copy that. Over.
  I said why'd you ask me if I could see it,
  if you haven't started feeding it? Over.
  Oh, that's better. I can hear you now. Over.
  Do you see it yet? Over.
  You know,you're a jackass.
  For the record, I don't want to hang out with you anymore
  when this is over.
  When this is what, Brian? Over.
  I said I don't want to hang out with you anymore
  - when this is over. - When this is what?
  You've got to finish your sentence. Over.
  That's it. My sentence is over.
  Your sentence is what, Brian? Over.
  My sentence is...
  Wait a minute. I have to say "over"
  even if the sentence ends with the word "over"?
  Ends with the word what, Brian? Over.
  - Oh, I see the wire. - You see the wire what? Over.
  Over!
  Tonight's movie presentation is brought to you by Sanka.
  Don't you want a, want a Sanka?
  Don't you want a, want a Sanka?
  It doesn't keep me up at night,
  but it helps me poo!
  Meg, sweetie, it's been, like, two
  Don't you think it's time to forget about that boy?
  Yeah, Meg, he was a bum anyway. You'll find another fellow.
  I could set you up with one of my friends.
  Oh wait... I don't have any friends.
  I could set you up with Dad.
  Dad, would you be interested in dating Meg?
  I certainly would.
  There, Meg, everything's fine.
  - It's not Michael I'm upset about! - Well, what is it then?
  I'm pregnant!
  Dad, I swear to God
  I didn't know that when I set you up with her.
  Oh, I can't believe this! My baby's pregnant!
  - How could this happen? - I don't know.
  But regardless of how it happened, it happened.
  You're pregnant, Meg, and there's only one thing to do.
  Meg, can you turn over? I gotta get that thing out of there.
  You're sitting on my shirt; I gotta put it on this hanger.
  Now I'm going to Michael's house to force him to marry you.
  Dad, please don't do this!
  - You can't make him marry me! - I just want to talk to him.
  Why do you have a shotgun?
  I just wantto talk to him.
  - Dad, this is ridiculous! - I just want to talk to him.
  - I just want totalk to him. - It is not his fault!
  - I just want to shoot him. - You can't shoot him!
  Wait, what... what are you doing?
  You got my Meg pregnant!
  What?! Oh, my God!
  Meg! Why didn't you tell me?
  I didn't think you wanted to see me.
  But this changes everything. I want to be there for you, Meg.
  I love you.
  Will you marry me?
  Yes! Of course!
  Ah, now see? That's an even more beautiful sight
  than 72 virgins waiting in heaven
  for a suicide bomber.
  Here I am!
  We're playing Magic: The Gathering. Want to join?
  Osama!
  - You know something, Brian? - Yeah?
  I'm starting to think maybe
  we bit off a little more than we could chew.
  Yeah.
  Well, we're in it and we're going to finish the job.
  Should we get started on the upper level?
  No.
  What the hell are we gonna do?
  We've sunk all of our money into this place.
  I've, um... I've got an idea. I'll be right back.
  So, listen, we're going to want to be leaving now.
  Why ?
  Because I just emptied a full tank of gasoline and lit a match.
  We've got about five seconds.
  Didn't we have an electrician in there today?
  He left. Pretty sure he left.
  Isn't that his truck?
  Well, by God, Brian, we're murderers.
  I guess this means you'll be going to doggie hell.
  Hey, what do you guys think of this one?
  Meg, are you sure you want to go through with this?
  You know, there are other options.
  Mom, I'm not getting an abortion!
  I'm not saying an abortion, per se,
  maybe you just drink and smoke a lot.
  What ?!
  Just don't stop doing it
  and then chicken out halfway through the pregnancy,
  because then you'll wind up with Chris.
  Well, Lois, I got the cake.
  Oh, and they were all out of the bride and groom figurines,
  so I got the Iron Giant and a courtroom doll
  that kids use to show where the molester touched them.
  All right, Meg, enjoy your bachelorette party.
  I'm out of here
  'cause I don't need to see what you crazy girls
  are going to do while I'm gone.
  But just remember, this is a residence
  and should be treated as such.
  And if you girls drink anything,
  there's recycling under the sink in the kitchen.
  Okay, have fun.
  So... what are we supposed to do?
  Yeah, this doesn't seem like much of a party.
  Hey, what's with all the noise?
  Got some complaints from next door.
  I might have to take you girls... downtown.
  Which one of you is the lucky bride?
  - What's your name, sweetie? - Dad, you know my name.
  It's Officer Nasty.
  Careful, I might be carrying a concealed weapon.
  - Hello. - Hi. Name, please?
  - Neil Goldman. - Goldman, Goldman...
  - Sorry, no Neil Goldman. - Oh, I beg your pardon.
  I meant to say Chris Griffin.
  Griffin, Griffin... Oh! here it is.
  Says you're supposed to be an usher.
  Well, you need this.
  - Name, please? - Chris Griffin.
  Griffin, Griffin, hmm.
  I'm sorry, sir, Chris Griffin has already checked in.
  Well, that's impossible!
  Meg, are you ready?
  Sweetie, what's wrong?
  Mom, I can't do it. I can't get married.
  What?! Well, why not?
  Because... I'm not pregnant.
  What do you mean? How do you know?
  I got my period.
  I must've read the test wrong.
  What am I going to do? Michael's out there waiting for me.
  Well, Meg, the best thing you can do is be honest.
  Just tell Michael the truth.
  If he cares about you, he'll understand.
  I'll try. Thanks, Mom.
  - I love you. - I... you too, honey.
  God, look at Meg's fat shoulders in those spaghetti straps!
  It's like bread baking around twine.
  - Meg... you look beautiful. - Thank you , Michael.
  I have never been more in love
  with someone than I am with you right now.
  Oh, Michael, I love you, too.
  And I have some wonderful news:
  - I'm not pregnant. - What?!
  Dad, I'm sorry about this whole mess.
  You know what, Meg? It's all my fault.
  I never should've dragged you into this, anyway.
  I guess sometimes a father
  just gets a little over protective of his daughter, but
  you got to know I was only thinking about your happiness.
  I know, Dad. And I appreciate it.
  The problem now is that these people are expecting a show.
  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty.
  Hello, again.
  Nice to see you
  It's been a long time You're just as lovely
  As you used to be
  How's your new life? Are you happy?
  Hope you're doin' fine
  Just to know it
  Means so much to me...



Title: McStroke

Mom, where's Dad?
  Over across the street.
  He's collecting Cleveland's mail while he's out of town.
  Black guy mail.
  Peter, you're just supposed to pick up Cleveland's mail,
  not go through it.
  Lois, black people are different than you and I.
  And me, I find that hilarious.
  Boy, Cleveland gets a lot of magazines.
  Grape Soda Today.
  Orange Soda Quarterly.
  The Fruit Punch Reader.
  Hey, what you got there, Stewie?
  Ooh, Mustache Aficionado.
  Wow, look at these men.
  What class, what grace.
  And all because of a little upper lip hair.
  Lois,
  I am going grow a mustache.
  Then I'll have it made like the Monopoly guy.
  Except when he goes directly to jail.
  I wish I could tell you that the Monopoly guy
  fought the good fight and the Sisters let him be.
  I wish I could tell you that.
  But prison is no fairy-tale world.
  Hey, Rupert, what if the refrigerator
  was a monster that talked like this?
  I am a monster.
  I am going to bite your fingers.
  Here I come.
  I'm going to get you.
  Ah! I don't want to play anymore
  Normal voice, normal voice!
  The refrigerator can't hurt me.
  Okay?
  Oh, my God, Dad, what's on your face?
  It's a mustache, Meg.
  Oh, I think it's sexy.
  I think it's gay.
  It's not gay, Brian.
  If I'm gay, then Freddie Mercury was gay.
  Freddie Mercury the lead singer of Queen?
  He was incredibly gay.
  He was not!
  He had a mustache which is praal like wedding ring
  I imagine you're going to be much more of a stern father,
  now that you have a mustache.
  Well, Chris, there may bemore lap sitting than there'sn.
  And I might answer most of your questions with a story.
  But, mostly,my mustache tells people
  that there is a 90% chance that I am poorly educated,
  that I keep upscale pornziou the open
  and that I listen tothe Little River Band with giant headphones.
  Ugh! That's the ugliest thing the Fatman's grown since that horse leg.
  Hey, Peter, have you seen my...
  Aw, Brian, I'm sorry, but what do I keep saying?
  Do not stand behind me, because I will get scared.
  And now back to One Tree Hill.
  Dude, let me tell you something:

  Oh, my God!There's somebody trapped inside!
  Wait, if I go in there,I could get hurt.
  No! No, with great mustachecomes great responsibility.
  My mustache!
  Nooooo!
  God bless you, sir,you saved my life.
  But at what cost?
  At what cost?!
  Peter, have youseen Brian?
  No, Lois, I have not.
  Well, I haven't seen him since this morning and I..
  What isthat on your head?
  It's a mustache, Lois.
  What, you never seena mustache before?
  Lois, would you mind callingthe police or something?
  Quiet, mustache!
  Oh, my God!
  Peter, I know you're upsetabout losing that thing,
  get a grip on yourself.
  Let Brian down.
  No. I'm not living my life without a mustache.
  Even if, sometimes,my mustache has Alpo gas
  Mustache fart.
  Hello, I'm lookingfor Peter Griffin.
  I'm Peter Griffin.
  Mr. Griffin, my nameis Todd Meyers.
  I'm the man you rescuedfrom McBurgertown.
  Oh yeah, you're the guywho cost me my mustache.
  What, you come over here to rape my daughter?
  No, I own the restaurant, and to show my gratitude,
  I'd like to offer you a lifetimesupply of McBurgertown burgers.
  Free burgers?
  Oh, man, this isa way better offer than the one I gotfrom Helen Hunt.
  You wanna have sex?
  No...
  No, no, no, no...no..
  no..
  Peter, you shouldreally slow down.
  You've already hadlike 30 hamburgers.
  Shut up, Brian.
  It relieves the painof mustachelessness.
  And it's working.
  I no longer feel the pain.
  Come to think of it,I can't really feel anything
  on the left half of my body.
  Really?
  That doesn'tsound good.
  Peter, are youwinking at me?
  Oh, my God, someonecall an ambulance!
  Doctor, what happened?
  Is he gonna be okay?
  Mrs. Griffin, your husbandhas had a stroke.
  The left half of his bodyis completely paralyzed.
  Oh, my God!
  Peter, sweetheart,how do you feel?
  Uh... had better days, Lois.
  Had better days.
  Mom, it's beenthree months.
  When is Dad gonnaget better?
  Chris, I've alreadyexplained this to you.
  Your father had a stroke and it may take him along time to recover.
  Lois!
  Bring me anotherbeer, please!
  Uh, Lois, you mind telling me
  what the hellyou think you're doing?
  I'm handing you a beer.
  You are handing itto my stroke arm.
  This is my good arm! Bring the beer over here!
  That's better.
  So, I'm shaving last nightat this make-out party.
  I took a bunch of pictures.
  You can see them onmy MySpace page,
  along with my favorite songsand movies and things
  that other people have created,
  but that I use toexpress my individualism.
  I have a MySpacepage too.
  Yeah, I havemine ironically.
  Hey, why don't youguys get lost.
  I have to talk to Connie.
  - Hey, guess what? - What?
  That's what.
  No, but seriously,
  there's something I wantto talk to you about.
  Sure, Zac.Anything for you.
  You wanna go out toAnal Point this weekend,
  see what all thebuzz is about?
  OMG!
  That'd be so awesome! Sweet.
  We're gonna havea real ragin' time.
  Before you know it, we'll belike an old married couple.
  - Uh, Lois? - Yeah?
  Uh, Peter's getting in the car.
  ...baffled, trumped,tethered, cropped
  Look at that low plane,fine then, uh-oh, overflow
  Population, common food,but it'll do
  Shave yourself,serve yourself
  World serves its own needs,listen to your heartbeat
  Dummy with the rapture and therevered and the right, right
  Your vitriolic, patriotic,slam, fight, bright light
  Feeling pretty psyched
  It's the end of the worldas we know it...
  Stroke, stroke,stroke!
  Stop mocking me!
  Well, Brian, you'velost your bet.
  I- or rather, myalter ego, Zac Sawyer-
  am currently the most popular boy at James Woods High.
  Well, Stewie, you got the best of meon this one.
  Congratulations.
  I guess you'll behanging up your wig now?
  Oh, no, Brian.
  I'm enjoyingmyself to much
  Do you know thatI've got a date
  with Connie D'Amico this Saturday night,at Anal Point?
  Ah, I've heardabout that place.
  Really?What's it like?
  'Cause I haveno idea.
  Well, uh, I supposeif you imagine it like a parking spacethat you think,
"Gosh, there's no way I'm gonna be ableto fit in there."
But then you fold inthe sideview mirrors and
sure enough,well, look at that.
Well, in that scenario, it sounds like I'd rather be
the parking spacethan the car.
Yeah, that's whatI've always guessed.
I hate being all strokey.
This is all your fault,McBurgertown.
You and your delicioushamburgers!
I swearI'll get back at you someday
for what you did to meand what you did to Wimpy.
I would gladlypay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
If only there were some way I could belike everybody else again.
How long was I in there?
About five minutes.
Why are we notfunding this?
Sweetheart, that's incredible.
And it only took five minutes?
Five minutes.I went in there they injected me
with a little bitof that fetal crap,and bam
good ol'gambling man Peter.
And now I can take my revengeon McBurger Town.
Wait. What?
It's their fault I had a stroke, Brian.
And I'm gonna sue 'em for it.
Peter, you ate 30 hamburgers.
It was your own fault.
Yeah, besides, Peter,
those companies have huge legal divisions.
You can't fight that.
I'll find a way with the help
of my snarky cat lawyer
Meowsy McDermott.
You've got to be kitten me!
Ha!
This court finds in favor of the defendant,
McBurgertown Industries.
What?! Hey, come on! That's not fair!
Mr. Griffin, what did you expect?
They have a hundred lawyers,
and you tried to bribe me
with a subscription to Grape Soda Today
which I already have.
Case dismissed.
What did I tell you, Peter?
One man can't take on a
multinational fast food conglomerate.
Oh, yes, I can. This ain't over, Brian.
Those people are bad and
I'm gonna prove it to the world.
How do you expect to do that?
Are you kidding?
I've tackled tougher jobs before.
Remember that time I was Robin
Williams' jumping-off point?
- Okay... religion. - Oh, religion.
You kill me, I kill you, we both go to heaven.
72 virgins, huh!
You might have to help me out
with the last ten or so
because Mr. Happy gets tired- religion.
Politics.
Well, we're gonna come down there and take all your oil.
But this is our oil.
Yee-haw! Well, here's my missile.
Okay, take it, take it. Politics.
Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna take a five-minute break.
Huh, five-minute break.
What are you, a construction worker?
Hey, baby, I'm not gay.
Does this yellow hat make my ass look fat?
Five-minute break.
You enjoyed the movie, baby?
Yeah, but I think I'm gonna
enjoy this even more.
Ugh! No, thanks. I am stuffed.
So, we just gonna sit here and talk
or are we gonna do it?
All right, baby, those are the magic words.
Now check this out!
Oh, my God!
Yeah, I am ready for sex.
I drank eight gallons of water today.
This baby's ready to explode.
Is..
is there more underneath of is that it?
I'm sorry?
Zac, just get the hel lout of my car.
That's it? That was sex?
What a rip-off.
I should sue her.
Be careful you're not held in contempt of cat.
Pardon me.
We're two Asian businessmen
looking to invest
in McBurgertown Industries
and we'd like a tour of your facility.
You don't look Asian.
Well, I guess we'll just take
our millions of Dongs elsewhere.
Wait, wait!
Let me get our general manager.
Peter, what the hell do you expect to accomplish here?
Evidence, Brian.
I'm gonna find just the right piece
of incriminating evidence to bring down this company.
Over here is a menu from our first
McBurgertown restaurant in 1952.
At that time, our value meal
consisted of a hamburger,
a cup of coffee and a Lucky Strike.
Wow. How much did all that cost?
Back in the '50s, one straw penny.
- A whole strawpenny? - Indeed. Follow me.
Hey, what's in there?
Oh, I'm sorry. That's off limit.
Now if you'll excuse me for a second,
I have to go to the bathroom
for about 30 minutes
as I eat a lot of meat.
Please give me your word that
you won't go in that door.
Okay.
Good. See you in a half hour.
Peter, this is your chance!
Brian, I gave him my word.
The hell with that.
Let's see what's behind this door.
My God, what is this?!
This must be the McBurgertown slaughterhouse.
Sir, you are correct.
But in here, we call it "DaCow."
- DaCow? - DaCow.
Except we spell the "chau" part C-O-W,
Like "cow," so it's kind of a... eh, sort of a dark joke.
Yeah, yeah, it's a Holocaust joke.
That's, that's really funny.
Unfortunately, life in a
slaughterhouse is no laughing matter.
They have killed a great many of us,
including my beloved wife.
Peter, this is it.
This is the evidence you've been looking for.
If we can get you out of here, would you be willing to testify
publicly about these atrocities?
Oh, absolutely.
But how do you intend to escape?
You leave that to us. Come on.
Hey!
There they are! After them!
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday

Charcoal burning everywhere
Another Pleasant ValleySunday
Here in status symbol land...
Hey, hey, what's up, Lucas?
What the hell's your problem?
Hey, Logan, what's going on?
What the hell is going on here?
Nothing, baby penis.
Well, yes, I have a baby-
Well, for your information,
I don't want a big penis.
I think they're messy.
Well, you've effectively ended
my reign of coolness, haven't you?
You're a disgrace, you know that?
Hey, you're the one with the tiny penis.
You know, Connie, look, you're right.
I behaved like a fool. And I apologize.
But, before I go,
could I maybe have one last kiss?
Well, I guess so.
Look, this girl is making out with a baby!
A nude baby!
Hey!
That's right. To hell with you all!
I am who I am.
Here comes the story of The Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done...
Quiet, everybody, this is it.
The McBurgertown franchise suffered
a publicity setback today from which it may not recover,
thanks to testimony regarding
its practices by a very brave cow.
I have revealed to you, today, these horrors
in the hope that you will see the need for change.
But always remember what I have done here today
is not a courageous act.
The courage lies with a man who has the guts
to say no to a fast food restaurant
and eat a salad instead.
To say, "I will eat this salad with pride.
I don't care if I look like a gay person."
So to all of you salad-eating homosexuals,
I say thank you.
And thank you, Peter, for all you've done
to help expose this grave injustice.
Where will you go now, Mr. Cow?
I cannot stay here?
Peter said I could stay here.
Oh... gosh...yeah, I don't,
I don't really see how that's gonna work out.
Oh. Well, as I said, Peter just promised...
Yeah, I should stop you there.
I didn't really promise anything.
I just said "Maybe, if it was okay with Lois."
Boy, it just it seems like a real burden to me.
Well, this is pretty awkward.
Ciaoooo...

  What...?
  Oh, my God.
  Right.
  It's like you...
  Don't even have cancer!
  - I know. - Oh, my God.
  No, but I still have pretty aggressive cancer.
  Come on, Peter.
  We're gonna be late for lunch with Mom and Dad.
  Oh. Right.
  You didn't forget, did you?
  No, no, I didn't forget.
  Let me just go change out of this fishing gear.
  Hey, Peter, what's up?
  Come on, come on, we got to go now.
  We got to go now. Come on, Joe! Joe! Quagmire!
  Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!
  Pull the car around. Come on, let's go.
  Hello?
  Lois, this is Peter.
  I'm afraid that on my way to the bedroom to change,
  I took ill.
  You'd best go to lunch without me.
  Why do I hear an engine?
  Uh... because my stomach is rumbling in a way
  that sounds like the engine of Joe's fishing truck.
  Peter, are you lying?
  Oh, now she's a doctor, guys.
  Hey, Lois!
  Quagmire says hi.
  Damn it, Peter, you're going fishing, aren't you?
  You promised you'd come to lunch with my parents today.
  Well, Lois, until we get an appointment secretary,
  things like this are gonna continue to fall through the cracks.
  My parents are not gonna like this, Peter.
  You know they're still angry at how you behaved at our wedding.
  You may now kiss the bride, Kiss her?
  I am gonna destroy her.
  Mom, are you still mad at Dad about yesterday?
  Well, sort of.
  I mean, we planned that lunch two weeks ago.
  But he promised he'd go with me
  to put flowers on my grandmother's grave
  this afternoon, so i guess it's all right.
  Peter, are you ready...?
  Oh. Right.
  So, uh, a lot of tension with Peter lately, huh?
  Ugh, that's an understatement, Brian.
  He's been incredibly thoughtless lately.
  Even more so than usual.
  But tonight is our sex night,
  and a little physical release will do us both some good.
  Peter, are you...? Oh, come on!
  Lois, I know it's late, but me and the guys were going beekeeping.
  Oh, my God, what the hell is wrong with you?!
  Whoa, someone just yelled themselves
  out of honey with breakfast.
  I don't need honey, Peter, I need a husband who wants
  to spend time with me.
  Can I make a suggestion?
  All you two have done is argue about stuff
  for the past two weeks.
  It's my guess you could use a vacation.
  Why don't you come out to Martha's Vineyard
  and watch me accept my award.
  Wow, does that sound wonderful.
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, that sounds expensive.
  Can't we just do something fun here at the house?
  It's just as relaxing.
  Hey, guys, I've decided I'm gonna take up the drums.
  I'll start packing.
  Look, Quagmire, we're only gonna be on Martha's Vineyard for a couple
  days.
  Can't you just watch the kids?
  Aw, man, you're more of a letdown than Fruit Stripe gum.
  What are we gonna do, Lois?
  re out of town.
  Well, what about Cleveland?
  He's on the road touring with Black Box.
  Everybody, everybody Everybody, everybody
  Well, wait a minute, what about that
  nice old man who lives up the street?
  Oh, yeah, maybe Herbert could watch the kids.
  He seems like a responsible guy.
  So it would only be till Monday and we could pay you for it.
  Yeah, and it's real easy, I promise.
  I mean, you've spent time watching children, right?
  Uh, yes, sir. Yes, I have.
  Wonderful.
  Brian, this is wonderful.
  I feel like one of the Kennedys.
  You know, the overprivileged drunk ones,
  not the socially responsible dead ones.
  You know, this resort offers some wonderful amenities.
  They have bird watching, wine tasting, horseback riding.
  Yeah, they also have stork startling.
  Squawkety, squawkety, squawkety, squawkety, squawkety, squawkety!
  Your bird intelligence is no match for my people intelligence.
  All right, children, your mammy and pappy
  asked me to look after you for the next couple days.
  So I want to lay down a few ground rules.
  No cussing, clean your plates,
  and only a half hour of radio and then it's off to bed.
  Well, that sucks.
  And don't you mouth off to me
  or I'm gonna slap you right in your penis.
  No offense, Mr. Herbert, but I'm a 17-year-old girl
  and I don't need you here.
  Well, no offense to you, Meg,
  but you're a 17-year-old girl and I don't need you here.
  What do you think's keeping Peter?
  I hope he gets here before they give you your award.
  Well, you're here, Lois.
  That's enough for me.
  Oh, you always know just what to say.
  And now, reading a passage from his grand prize-winning
  short essay, "Amazing Grace," tonight's guest of honor,
  Mr. Brian Griffin.
  Thank you very much.
"She was grace in name and in essence.
"To those she loved, she exuded strength,
"life, laughter and light.
"And to me, also sorrow.
"For circumstance had bound her to my best friend,
"through whom we met in the warmth and serenity of her home.
"Nothing from the first day I saw her
"and no one that has happened to me since
"has ever been as frightening and as confusing.
"For no person I've ever known has ever done more
"to make me feel more sure, more insecure,
more important and less significant. "
That was beautiful, Brian.
Well, you know what they say-
write what's in your heart.
Hey, oh!
Oh, did-did I miss Byron's reward?
Brian's award.
And, yes, you did, Peter.
You've been a good son, Brian.
And I'm sorry you're so sick.
What?
Peter, where the hell have you been?
Every time that we go to a hotel,
you hide the key to the minibar from me.
But I found it.
Found it.
You're a piece of work, you know that?
An hour late and you're drunk.
You had an opportunity to share a beautiful moment with Brian
and you wasted it, wasted it like the Osmond family wastes water.
Who's in the shower? Is it Donny?
No, I showered earlier. It could be Meryl.
Meryl's right here.
Well, where's Jimmy?
Jimmy's running through the sprinklers in the yard.
Is it Marie?
No, no one's in there.
So the shower's just running with no one in there?
That's right.
Well, I'll be a son of a gun.
Hey. Good morning.
Oh, good morning, Brian.
Ooh, that's a lovely fragrance you're wearing.
What is it?
Oh, this?
This is Hartz-Mountain flea dip.
Kills ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes.
It's very potent.
Almost as potent as the inspiration you give me
to plumb the deepest fathoms of my soul
for a literary bounty of truth and loveliness.
Aah! That's so much better.
Ah, morning, Lois.
I'm sorry about last night.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
Well, if you really mean that,
I was hoping we could go paddle boating today.
Great, but can we do it after 5:00?
There's a ballgame on.
Oh, well, then, maybe Brian and I can hang out.
Do you mind, Brian?
No, not at all.
Good, now can you move, please? You're blocking the screen.
We now return to
Damn, Nature, You Scary on BET.
Damn, look at that son-bitch go.
He hauling ass.
That thing come by my house, I kill it.
That little rat looking thing just got ate.
Damn, Nature, you scary!
Y'all know what day it is?
No.
It's bath day.
I don't want to take a bath.
Not for you, silly. It's bath day forme.
But I can't wash myself.
Know anybody with a pair of strong, young hands
to help me in and out of the tub?
Aw, rats!
Oh, I had so much fun today, Brian.
So did I.
Hey, you feel like grabbing something to eat?
Oh, I'd love to, but Peter and I
were gonna get dinner at that little place by the...
Lois...
Went to...
Well... looks like lamfree.
Hey, you know what might be fun?
How about we just order room service
and watch a couple of bad movies?
Yeah, that does sound like fun.
I'll go rentVanilla Sky.
I said a bad movie, not an abortion.
Ah, this is gonna be great- a whole evening with Lois!
We are gonna have such a fun time.
Lois, my darling!
Couple of steaks, some wine, maybe a couple of sundaes...
Lois, my darling!
...little music, some candlelight.
Lois, my darling!
What am I doing? This is Lois, Peter's wife.
H- How can I even think about trying anything?
Hello?
Hey, Brian, it's me. I got a question for you.
Herbert and I are playing Scattergories.
Would you count Nyquil as a beverage?
- No, right? - No.
Yeah, not gonna fly, old man. Thanks, Brian.
Damn it! I'm missing Boy Meets Worldfor this?
This is so much fun, Brian.
Well, it's a Saturday night-
sorry the video store pickings were a little sparse.
Hope you like Roman Holiday.
Tee-hee! I lied.
I was a princess the whole time.
You bitch!
I'm gonna punch you in the face!
Ah, that was a lovely dinner.
I saved all my scraps in a bag for you.
Thanks. You know, Lois, I'm sure you've already
figured this out, but...
that essay I wrote- I wrote it about you.
Aw... I had a hunch. Thank you, Brian.
I'm glad you shared that with me.
Well, you know, Lois, you mean a lot to me.
I mean, things you say and things you do
resonate with me in a big way.
When you drive away to go to the market,
I just don't know what to do with myself.
And then when I hear that car
coming up the driveway, I just go berserk.
I mean, you know, half the time, when you go to the market,
I just assume you're leaving forever, and when you get back,
I realize I have no idea how long you've been gone, and I...
Well, you know what, I'm-I'm rambling. I...
Would you like some more champagne?
I'd love some.
Ah! My head is swimming.
Oh, my God! Brian, no!
Now, stop it!
What are you doing?!
I can't help myself, Lois!
I know you're married to Peter, but I love you and
I can't stand it anymore!
Brian, no!
No! Get down! Get down!
This is a good sweater!
Brian, I think you'd better go.
Lois, I'd really like to talk about this.
No! Stop scratching the door!
Oh, my God, I attacked Lois!
What the hell was I thinking? I'm a rapist!
I'm-I'm no better than...
Kobe Bryant or Mike Tyson or Reagan!
Hey, Brian, another Scattergories question.
The category is "Type of Pet. " Herbert put "Cambodian. "
That's not right, right?
Look, Stewie, I can't talk about this now, all right?
Geez, what's yourproblem?
I- I just...
I did a bad thing, and I don't know what to do about it.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Ugh! That's howlfelt at that Grateful Dead show.
Does anybody want to buy my shirt?!
I'll trade you my shirt for a grilled cheese!
So, what happened, sport?
Come on, talk to your pal, Stewie.
All right, but only because
I've got to tell somebody.
I- I pretty much just threw myself at Lois.
So, you finally did it, huh?
Well, look, Brian, as your friend,
I- I should tell you
that that vagina is ground zero, man.
I mean, I-I just...
I wrecked that thing on the way out.
And just to be a jerk,
I carved "Brooks was here" in the wall.
Did-did you see that?
Did you see "Brooks was here"?
We didn't have sex.
'Course, what with Chris going before me,
I pretty much just walked out of there.
Didn't even have to stoop over.
There was even room to
twirl a cane as I strolled.
You're exaggerating.
Only a little bit- that's the messed-up thing.
Morning, Lois.
Peter, there you are.
Were you down at that hotel bar all night again?
I was, Lois- and you know who's staying at this hotel?
Nathan Lane!
We got wasted at the bar, and he ended up
asking me to marry him.
So I convinced this minister to do the job,
but the joke's on Nathan Lane,
'cause gay people can't get married!
They can in this state, Peter.
Well, in that case, we're registered at Filene's.
God, you've spent half this entire trip intoxicated!
Oh, I'm intoxicated all right, Lois-
by the beauty and magic
of Martha's Vineyard.
Nantucket, Cape Cod,
and all the great destinations
that make Massachusetts
the wondrous place it is.
The spirit of Massachusetts
is the spirit of America
The spirit of what's old
and what's new
The spirit of Massachusetts
is the spirit of America
The spirit of the red, white and blue.
I am so glad Brian
brought us out here, Lois.
He's a real pal, you know that?
Well, it's actually Brian
I need to talk to you about.
Boy, he's a hell of a guy, isn't he?
He's the one guy I know I can trust.
Brian tried to have sex with me.
Was he bigger than me?
"... and they told Peter
to stay away from the wolf.
But he didn't listen to them... "
'cause he's his own man.
And he knew that sometimes the things that seem
the most dangerous turn out
to be the most fun!
Yes, sir, it was a good day
for young Peter.
Are you a pedophile?
Hey, uh...
Lois told me there was
some funny business.
Yeah, what of it?
Well, it's just...
I can't help but feel a little betrayed, Brian.
Lois is my wife, and... well, I mean,
all the dry food I've bought
for you over the years?
Yeah, well, you don't deserve her, you know that?
Say what, now?
You don't deserve her.
She does nothing but give and give and give,
and you repay her
with selfishness and neglect.
I mean, you've barely spent
any time with her at all on this vacation.
Well, who the hell are you to
tell me how to run my marriage?
You can't even hang on to a girlfriend
for more than a couple months!
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Oh, you're a freakin' train wreck with that crap, Brian.
You couldn't even get Gillian to take you back,
and she was dumber than Lou Ferrigno.
Stop it! Stop it!
Get off my husband!
Wait a minute, Brian.
Nathan Lane is right. What are we doing?
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
It's just... wh-when you have feelings for someone
that are strong enough, you just...
I don't know, lose sight of the rest of the world.
Brian, she's my wife.
And you're my best pal.
So what are we gonna do about this?
I promise, Peter, nothing like this will ever happen again.
Thanks, old buddy.
Yeah, blah, blah, blah!
That's all well and good, Peter.
Now, get ready, we're having
dinner with my parents tonight!
Oh. Right.
I just feel terrible about this whole thing, Lois.
Can you ever forgive me?
Yes, Brian, I can.
But there's something
you deserve to know.
What's that?
Well...
it's not like I haven't thought about it.
Really?
Well,yes. I mean, you and I have a lot in common,
and we've spent so much time
together over the years, and...
of course, that essay you wrote, oh, it really touched my heart.
Well, to be honest, Lois, I ripped off
most of that speech from Summer of '42.
Well, it was still nice.
Let me just ask you this.
When these thoughts about you
and I have crossed your mind,
is it... good?
What do you mean?
Well, uh, uh...
Yeah.
Well, a lot of times when Peter and
I are having sex, I feel suffocated.
But with you, I imagine
it would be like doing it
with a stuffed animal.
Everybody ready to go?
All set, Peter.
Good.
Well, we may be leaving Martha's Vineyard,
but the spirit of this wonderful place
will stay in our hearts
all the way home.
'Cause after all...
The spirit of Massachusetts
is the spirit of America
The spirit of what's old
and what's new
The spirit of Massachusetts
is the spirit of America
The spirit of the red, white and blue
The spirit of Massachusetts
is the spirit of America
The spirit of what's old
and what's new
The spirit of Massachusetts
is the spirit of America
The spirit of the red...
White...
And blue!



Title: The Former Life of Brian

Hey, Stewie, you ready to go home?
  About an hour ago.
  This party sucks.
  What happened to your face?
  I'a ttcat.
  Stupid face-painters apparently never heard of Darth Maul.
  This party's worse than a Mexican funeral.
  Es con mucho dolor que digamos adios a Javier..
  y Pepe y Carlos y Lupe, y otra Lu
  ,lvor Faan, Jesus, Maria,
  Vincente, y los perros de Vincente.
  Come on. Let's get out of here, Ban.
  Wait. Hang on a second.
  Who's that?
  That's Jared's mom.
  Her husband died in Iraq.
  Really?
  No, wait. He was either wounded or killed.
  don't remember.
  Well, which is it, Stewie, wounded or killed?
  I can work with either.
  No, no, he's dead. He's dead.
  Just like the Pink Panther.
  What's wrong with him, Doctor?
  Well, it seems his lungs are completely filled
  with Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.
  What?!
  Will he be okay?
  Noheon bok.
  One-third of his body weight is Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.
  llth'st.
  But don't worry, he won't burn in hell thanks to all that
  Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.
  How about at gianhu Yeah, he's great.
  I love magicians.
  I don't know why, but I've always found magic very sexy.
  I'm a magician.
  You are?
  How long have you been doing magic?
  Oh, long time.
  I used to work with Doug Henning.
  Wow.
  Yeah. Want to e Dg nng?
  Welcome to the wonderful world of magic.
  Hope I don't get AIDS.
  Oh, God, that is so my humor.
  You know, my son's birthday party is next weekend.
  Any chance I can hire you to do your act?
  Absolutely!
  I think the magis arngo pp already.
  Brian, this is painful.
  It's like listening to those two foreign guys
  down at the coffee shop o' bn vi ithU.
  almost long enough to sound American.
  Oh, man, what a good bunch of partying at that discotheque.
  eylad e mauence requests.
  Way awesome.
  I myself drank, like, five liters of beer.
  Any more and I would have ended up in hospital, man.
  Ohyosa ifrnd to stay 'cause I almost hadsex on this girl.
  Oh, yeah! But itwas soxpsive.
  Each drink was, like,x lls.
  And if I've donethis right,
  then this isyour car Swi
  Really, Brian?Card tricks?
  That's what's gonna closethe deal with this woman?
  Well, yeah.Why not?
  You need more than t u need an act.
  Listen, I'll beyour assistant, and we'll put on a whole big show.
  Really?
  Yeah, we'll doall the great tricks.
  You can evensplit me in half.
  What?w iha.
  Well, I am still a little shaky onsome of this stuff.
  I guess I coulduse the help.
  Great. And we'll get youa wand, a top hat and a cape.
  In fact, you can usePeter's cape from last year'sHaeen costume.
  Hi, Brian.
  I'm Count Crotchula,the bulging vampire.
  I'll bite your neck, but also look w gamowthe.
  That costume doesn'tmake any sense.
  Don't stiflemy creativity!
  See that bulgedown there, Brian.
  Whats atWh iit
  Can't be my pointy teeth, 'cause those areall the way up here.
  I'll let you inon a little secret.
  Happy Halloween.
  Okay, kids, it's time forthe magic show.
  Hoabt birod applause for The Amazing Brian?!
  Yay!I love magic!
  I can't believe I agreedto four costume changes.
  Oh, who am I kidding?I insisted on it.
  Brian thanks so muchfor doing this.
  Paul and I are so excitedto see your act.
  Oh, thank...Wait. What?
  Paul, my boyfriend.
  Paul, this is Brian.
  Boyfriend?!Oh, come on!
  I id80foalth crap!
  You have a boyfriend?!
  Yeah.
  And I'm a great guy.
  I'm unemployed, but that makes her feel usefulin the relationship.
  m nnfihi
  Our relationshipwill do fine on that basis.
  If he had his life together, I wouldn'tbe into it.
  But I don't.
  God! I am so sickof this crap!
  Is this the show?
  You know what? The hell withboth of you!
  I'm outta here!
  Are we doing this thing or what?
  Brian? Brian?
  Well, this was a lot of effortfor nothing...
  like trying to tellMatthew McConaughey how much he sucks.
  You know, Matthew, I-I may not ever getotr an to say this,so I
  just want to get this offmy chest.
  You are just awful.
  You're one of the worst actors t hto ofi..
  ...and I think that you needto go away.
  Oh, thanks, man.
  The truth is I spendat least 90% of my year going away
  exploringexotic places, having sex with mybeautiful
  girlfriend,just doing sit-ups.
  I mean, I really...And then counting money.
  Money that I made off thteib fmsat I put out into the American
  populacebecause they just love to see me
  doing whatit is that I do.
  Yes, but you'renot hearing me.
  Dazed anCous wathonthgthat was passable.
  After that...Oh, thanks, man.
  That actuallylaunched my care
  After that, everything elsewas awful.
  Contact, they didn'teven need u tt vi They could have donethe
  whole movie without you.
  I know. I know. I saidthe same thing.
  but they're just, like, "Oh, we need agood-looking guy "
  with a greaasanso thtbs "to just provide
  some down-home enthusiasmin this picture.
  Something to counterbalanceJodie Foster."
  They took her to be,uh, slightlyd,, apoaab, you know?
  So they put mein there.
  I said it didn'tmake any sense.
  Said the, saidthe same thing about that Bill Murrayelephant movie,
  but they were just, like,"Oh, theudnc nd u.
  You make me physicallysick to my stomach,
  and I wish that you would get aheart attack.
  I totally feel you, man.
  Truth of the mte isI n'li my movies either, but, man, they
  justkeep offering me money
  and I do it and I getto go around the world.
  I mean, didyou see Sahara?
  te you whatthe move gave me was an opportunity to take an
  Airstreamall across the country
  and sell that pictureone person at a time.
  You suck donkey ass.
  Now, you can'tprove that.
  That was so humiliating!
  I mean, look atall the stuff I t se toujust to get laid.
  Oh, don't worry,my friend.
  One day you'llfind your soul mate.
  The sad thing is I already did...years ago.
  Try anan She was the greatest girl I ever met,and I blew it.
  You should look her up.
  Oh, am I boring you?
  No, it's just...long day.
  Well, I supposeI could look her up.
  I just wonder if she'd evenwant to see me.
  I wasn't exactly the nicestguy in the world.
  And then, inghchl, I was violated sexuallyby my father.
  It happened onnumerous occasions, and I was too idto tell
  anyone because I felt likesomehow it w mfat.
  So... you do goall the way.
  Well, here goes.
  Uh, Tracy?
  acFlag?
  Oh, my God, Brian Griffin, is that you?
  Uh, yeah, it's me.
  Analheanis to kiss you just one more time.
  Wow, you sure look...different than the last timeI saw you.
  ahhacu
  So to get out of hereI just make a left out
  of the driveway and drive as fastas I can?
  Wait. Brian, I'm actually gladyofod.
  There's someoneI've wanted you to meet for a long time.
  From the lookat those toenails,
  I bet it's thatlittle Lamisil monster.
  Brian, this is Dylan.
  He's... your son.
  Oh, no way!
  Jey!er! rr
  Gosh, this is alovely home, Tracy.
  That's so weird.
  It smells likethere's a cat, buI t ersno cat.
  I wanted you to meet Dylanfor a long time, Brian.
  Well, Brian, a son.
  How about that?
  Myodth imounmftable than the good-byein The Wizard of Oz.
  Good-bye, Tin Man.
  Good-bye, Doro Good-bye, Lion.
  Good-bye, Dorothy.
  I think I'll miss youmost of all, Scarecrow.
  Oh, okay.
  That's kind of anodd thing to say.
  Yeah, sort of a weird commentrit fntf
  l u Kinda thoughtthis was a team effort.
  Yeah, yeah.Really, really glad I risked my lifeand everything.
  Yeah, you're, like,five minutes from gone and you leave with that?
  You know, it's likecutting a huge fart and then walkingout of the room.
  And that's how we'll remember you,as a big fart.
  Good-bye, big fart.
  So, Dylan, um, shouldn'tyou be in school?
  I doknow.
  It's Wednesday.Up yours!
  Nice kid. Say, Brian,now that I think about it,
  how can you possible havea 13-year-old son enouourselfare only seven?
  Well, those are dog years.
  That doesn't makeany sense.
  You know what, Stewie?
  If you don't like it, go on the Internetand complain.
  Oh, it was awful.
  That kid was acomplete thug.
  I'm telling you, I couldn't get outof there fast enough.
  Boy, Brian, youdodged a bullet not having toraise that kid.
  Your life would havebeen more miserable
  than a lonely old widow
  livingin a downstairs apartment.
  Quiet! Keep itdown up there!
  What did I just say?
  I'm callg e li!
  I don't know, Brian.
  Don't you think you havea responsibility to your son?
  Hey, Lois, I didn't even knowI had a son until today.
  Anbede is t keTracy ever asked for my help.
  Yeah, it seemed likethey're all set without you.
  She's done a fine job creating a child-friendlyenvironment...
  Great parenting.
  I don't know, Brian.
  Raising a child is a veryrewarding experience.
  You know what elseis rewarding, Lois?
  Shuttin' your vag.
  What?Wh?
  Dylan! What are youdoing here?
  My mom wanted meto give you this.
"To Brian from Tracy.He's your obm w.
"P.S. Will you write mea letter of recommendation for the
Universityof Phoenix?"
No. No, I'm not gonna t se othli like that.
But Dylan, my God!

Dyn gnae ayingwith us for a while.
Dylan, it's so niceto meet you.
Shut up, bitch!

That's it. I'mtelling Brian he has to reign Dylan inonce and for all.
Hey, where isBrian anyway?
Oh, thanks, Lois.
Dylan put this paperbaony ad and I could not,
for the life of me, figure out howto get it off.
The kid's a sociopath.
Well, it's time yoiddown the law with him.
I couldn't agree more.
I am gonna kick himout of this house faster than NASA kicked
outthe Cocoa Puffs bird.
Okay, your physicalexam was within range.
You aced theflight simulator.
I guess all that's left isthe psychological screening.
Okay.
How do youfeel about this?
Ah, oh, my God,Cocoa Puffs.
No, that's not me anymore.
I'm just here to fly, sir.
All right, Dylan.You know what?
This isn't working out Alrit? don't carethat I'm your father,
and you don't care that you're my son.
We don't have anything in common.
I think it's best if you just get out of this house.
Fine. I hated you anyhow.
Get out of my way.
- My pot! - My pot!
- Your pot? - Your pot?
And then in chapter 28 of my novel,
the other pilots finally trust the Japanese
pilot and let him, let him into...
their group.
Dude, that is an amazing story.
Hey. Hey, what if, um, there were a Korean pilot?
Yeah. Um, I'm not really looking for notes,
but you know, Dylan, I gotta tell you something.
I'm sorry I wasn't around when you were growing up.
Don't. Just, just don't.
If-if I had known having
a son could be like this...
- How dare you? - I didn't know!
You had no right, man. No right.
- It wasn't my fault. - You weren't there for me.
Damn it, don't you think I wanted to be?
Shh. Shh. It's okay.
It's okay. Look, I know I wasn't there
for you man, for all those years,
but...that's gonna change.
It's gonna be different from now on.
And I'm gonna make you into a better person,
starting first thing tomorrow.
Just passing through.
See anything you like, speak up.
Hey, there, everybody.
Was somebody looking for a son
with a bright new path to
adulthood and his very, very proud Dad?
Oh, Dylan, you got a haircut.
Aren't you handsome?
From now on, I plan on being
a real father to Dylan,
and together, we are gonna turn his life around.
Right champ?
You said it, Dad.
All right! You ready for school?
Yeah. Hey, can I drive today?
Oh, this kid! He's only 13.
I know. I was just kidding.
Oh. We got a young Adam Sandler here, I think.
Right?
- Right? - Yes.
- Bye, Mom. - Bye!
All right, kids. Have a good day at school.
Hey, Dylan. Have a great day at school.
Thanks, Dad.
Hey. Knock-knock.
Who's there?
You're there.
I'll always be there, Dylan.

Hi! I'm Al Harrington of
Al Harrington's Wacky Waving
Inflatable, Arm-Flailing Tube-Man
Warehouse and Emporium.
As an unwanted result of a recent lawsuit,
I am now in possession of
hundreds of palettes of crudely
painted, not-so-funny plywood
cutout folk art, and it's just
waiting to transform your uncut,
trash-strewn lawn into a living canvas that tells
passers-by, "Hey, everyone, a real funny bugler lives here."
Your neighbors will chuckle warmly,
and motorists will slow down
and applaud when they cast
their eyes on such favorites as...
Sort-of Ben and Jerry's-Looking Cow,
Black Silhouetted Cowboy Leaning on Barn
and everybody's favorite,
Fat Woman Bending Over Tending to her Garden in Big,
Polka-Dotted Bloomers.
Most of this stuff is price to move
and until it does, it's an enormous fire hazard,
so please, come see me,
on Route 2 in Weekapaug.
Look for the Sort-of Ben and Jerry's Cow out front!
We interrupt this program to bring
you grim news out of
LaGuardia airport, where a 767 has been
forced to make a crash landing.
Oh, man, I tell you, now that I'm a parent,
I can't even watch stories like that.
I just think, you know, I just think,
"Oh, my God, what if Dylan were on that plane?"
Oh, my God, oh, I just don't know what I would do.
I don't know what I would do.
Yeah, yeah, I understand.
That'd be tough.
Oh, oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no. No, no, no.
Quagmire, no. You do not understand.
Until you have a child... Until you have a child,
you do not understand. Okay?
Damn it.
It's been like this all week.
Watch this: Hey, Brian, what would you
do if Dylan fell out a window?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God I don't even want to think about that.
I don't even want to think about that.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, no.
Brian, what would you do if Dylan was in a fire?
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, that's...
Oh, God. Oh, no, no,no.
Knock on wood. Knock on wood, Knock on wood.
Oh, I can't hear any more of this.
Peter, your dog is giving me diabetes.
Oh, boy, you're not kidding.
I tell you, I wish that old hag of Brian's
had never even told him he had a kid.
Well, wait a minute, Peter.
Maybe that's the answer.
You just gotta get his mother take him back.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
She's an idiot redneck, Peter.
Tricking her should be easier than
escaping from Canadian Alcatraz.
Can I go through here?
Just be back by bedtime.
Okay.
Lunch is ready, everyone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa. Lois, Lois.
This is, this is white bread.
Yeah. So?
Well, don't we have any of that whole-grain stuff?
No. This was cheaper.
I just, I just, I don't want Dylan eating white bread.
Brian, there's nothing wrong with it.
Lois, Lois, I do not want
Dylan eating white bread.
Brian, I promise you, it's fine.
Lois. Lois, Lois I will decide what is best for my child, all right?
Look, will you take it easy?
And, and, I do not want to have
this conversation in front of my son.
Okay, you know what? That's it, Brian.
Feed him whatever you want.
Tell, tell you what.
Go up to my jewelry box,
take my gold jewelry.
Melt it down. Make it into bread
and feed him that.
That good enough?
Gold bread good enough for your Dylan?!
Hey, everybody!
Look at who's back to pick up her son.
This isn't The Price is Right.
You said we were going to The Price is Right.
Peter. What the hell is this?
Mom. What are you doing here?
Tracy wants Dylan back.
Don't you want Dylan back, Tracy?
What a joyous family reunion.
Isn't this great, Brian?
Now Dylan can go back with his mom,
and you can stop acting like
such a jackass.
So that's what this is all about, huh?
I must say, you have been a little
insufferable lately, Brian.
We just want the old you back, that's all.
Look. All right. Okay, maybe I have
been acting different lately, all right?
But that's only because I've truly
connected with the one bit of
flesh and blood that I have on this earth.
And I have no intention of giving that up.
Who wants a half-and-half?
Oh, I'll throw my hat into that ring.
Wait a minute, Dad.
I think maybe I should go with her.
What? Dylan, why?
Look at her. She needs me-
a lot more than you do.
But we were just starting to make a real connection.
Listen.
I'll always be grateful to you for
turning my life around, but
now, thanks to you, I finally
have a chance to transform
my mom's life in the same way
you transformed mine.
You know, I guess a dad couldn't
ask for more than that.
I'm proud of you, Dylan.
My life will never be the
same for knowing you.
Good-bye and...
good luck.
Good-bye, Dad.
Come on, Mom. Let's go.
Bye. Thanks for coming.
I'm gonna miss that boy.
You know, I just finally figured it out.
She looks like a really hot Tim Russert.
Right?
- Right? - Yes.

Hey, Stewie, you ready to go home?
About an hour ago.
This party sucks.
What happened to your face?
I'a ttcat.
Stupid face-painters apparently never heard of Darth Maul.
This party's worse than a Mexican funeral.
Es con mucho dolor que digamos adios a Javier..
y Pepe y Carlos y Lupe, y otra Lu
,lvor Faan, Jesus, Maria,
Vincente, y los perros de Vincente.
Come on. Let's get out of here, Ban.
Wait. Hang on a second.
Who's that?
That's Jared's mom.
Her husband died in Iraq.
Really?
No, wait. He was either wounded or killed.
don't remember.
Well, which is it, Stewie, wounded or killed?
I can work with either.
No, no, he's dead. He's dead.
Just like the Pink Panther.
What's wrong with him, Doctor?
Well, it seems his lungs are completely filled
with Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.
What?!
Will he be okay?
Noheon bok.
One-third of his body weight is Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.
llth'st.
But don't worry, he won't burn in hell thanks to all that
Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.
How about at gianhu Yeah, he's great.
I love magicians.
I don't know why, but I've always found magic very sexy.
I'm a magician.
You are?
How long have you been doing magic?
Oh, long time.
I used to work with Doug Henning.
Wow.
Yeah. Want to e Dg nng?
Welcome to the wonderful world of magic.
Hope I don't get AIDS.
Oh, God, that is so my humor.
You know, my son's birthday party is next weekend.
Any chance I can hire you to do your act?
Absolutely!
I think the magis arngo pp already.
Brian, this is painful.
It's like listening to those two foreign guys
down at the coffee shop o' bn vi ithU.
almost long enough to sound American.
Oh, man, what a good bunch of partying at that discotheque.
eylad e mauence requests.
Way awesome.
I myself drank, like, five liters of beer.
Any more and I would have ended up in hospital, man.
Ohyosa ifrnd to stay 'cause I almost hadsex on this girl.
Oh, yeah! But itwas soxpsive.
Each drink was, like,x lls.
And if I've donethis right,
then this isyour car Swi
Really, Brian?Card tricks?
That's what's gonna closethe deal with this woman?
Well, yeah.Why not?
You need more than t u need an act.

Really?
Yeah, we'll doall the great tricks.
You can evensplit me in half.
What?w iha.
Well, I am still a little shaky onsome of this stuff.
I guess I coulduse the help.
Great. And we'll get youa wand, a top hat and a cape.
In fact, you can usePeter's cape from last year'sHaeen costume.
Hi, Brian.
I'm Count Crotchula,the bulging vampire.
I'll bite your neck, but also look w gamowthe.
That costume doesn'tmake any sense.
Don't stiflemy creativity!
See that bulgedown there, Brian.
Whats atWh iit
Can't be my pointy teeth, 'cause those areall the way up here.
I'll let you inon a little secret.
Happy Halloween.
Okay, kids, it's time forthe magic show.
Hoabt birod applause for The Amazing Brian?!
Yay!I love magic!
I can't believe I agreedto four costume changes.
Oh, who am I kidding?I insisted on it.
Brian thanks so muchfor doing this.
Paul and I are so excitedto see your act.
Oh, thank...Wait. What?
Paul, my boyfriend.
Paul, this is Brian.
Boyfriend?!Oh, come on!
I id80foalth crap!
You have a boyfriend?!
Yeah.
And I'm a great guy.
I'm unemployed, but that makes her feel usefulin the relationship.
m nnfihi
Our relationshipwill do fine on that basis.
If he had his life together, I wouldn'tbe into it.
But I don't.
God! I am so sickof this crap!
Is this the show?
You know what? The hell withboth of you!
I'm outta here!
Are we doing this thing or what?
Brian? Brian?
Well, this was a lot of effortfor nothing...
like trying to tellMatthew McConaughey how much he sucks.
You know, Matthew, I-I may not ever getotr an to say this,so I
just want to get this offmy chest.
You are just awful.
You're one of the worst actors t hto ofi..
...and I think that you needto go away.
Oh, thanks, man.
The truth is I spendat least 90% of my year going away
exploringexotic places, having sex with mybeautiful
girlfriend,just doing sit-ups.
I mean, I really...And then counting money.
Money that I made off thteib fmsat I put out into the American
populacebecause they just love to see me
doing whatit is that I do.
Yes, but you'renot hearing me.
Dazed anCous wathonthgthat was passable.
After that...Oh, thanks, man.
That actuallylaunched my care
After that, everything elsewas awful.
Contact, they didn'teven need u tt vi They could have donethe
whole movie without you.
I know. I know. I saidthe same thing.
but they're just, like, "Oh, we need agood-looking guy "
with a greaasanso thtbs "to just provide
some down-home enthusiasmin this picture.
Something to counterbalanceJodie Foster."
They took her to be,uh, slightlyd,, apoaab, you know?
So they put mein there.
I said it didn'tmake any sense.
Said the, saidthe same thing about that Bill Murrayelephant movie,
but they were just, like,"Oh, theudnc nd u.
You make me physicallysick to my stomach,
and I wish that you would get aheart attack.
I totally feel you, man.
Truth of the mte isI n'li my movies either, but, man, they
justkeep offering me money
and I do it and I getto go around the world.
I mean, didyou see Sahara?
te you whatthe move gave me was an opportunity to take an
Airstreamall across the country
and sell that pictureone person at a time.
You suck donkey ass.
Now, you can'tprove that.
That was so humiliating!
I mean, look atall the stuff I t se toujust to get laid.
Oh, don't worry,my friend.
One day you'llfind your soul mate.
The sad thing is I already did...years ago.
Try anan She was the greatest girl I ever met,and I blew it.
You should look her up.
Oh, am I boring you?
No, it's just...long day.
Well, I supposeI could look her up.
I just wonder if she'd evenwant to see me.
I wasn't exactly the nicestguy in the world.
And then, inghchl, I was violated sexuallyby my father.
It happened onnumerous occasions, and I was too idto tell
anyone because I felt likesomehow it w mfat.
So... you do goall the way.
Well, here goes.
Uh, Tracy?
acFlag?
Oh, my God, Brian Griffin, is that you?
Uh, yeah, it's me.
Analheanis to kiss you just one more time.
Wow, you sure look...different than the last timeI saw you.
ahhacu
So to get out of hereI just make a left out
of the driveway and drive as fastas I can?
Wait. Brian, I'm actually gladyofod.
There's someoneI've wanted you to meet for a long time.
From the lookat those toenails,
I bet it's thatlittle Lamisil monster.
Brian, this is Dylan.
He's... your son.
Oh, no way!
Jey!er! rr
Gosh, this is alovely home, Tracy.
That's so weird.
It smells likethere's a cat, buI t ersno cat.

You know what, Stewie?
If you don't like it, go on the Internetand complain.
Oh, it was awful.
That kid was acomplete thug.
I'm telling you, I couldn't get outof there fast enough.
Boy, Brian, youdodged a bullet not having toraise that kid.

livingin a downstairs apartment.

Don't you think you havea responsibility to your son?

Oh, man, I tell you, now that I'm a parent,
I can't even watch stories like that.
I just think, you know, I just think,
"Oh, my God, what if Dylan were on that plane?"
Oh, my God, oh, I just don't know what I would do.
I don't know what I would do.
Yeah, yeah, I understand.
That'd be tough.
Oh, oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no. No, no, no.
Quagmire, no. You do not understand.
Until you have a child... Until you have a child,
you do not understand. Okay?
Damn it.
It's been like this all week.
Watch this: Hey, Brian, what would you
do if Dylan fell out a window?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God I don't even want to think about that.
I don't even want to think about that.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, no.
Brian, what would you do if Dylan was in a fire?
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, that's...
Oh, God. Oh, no, no,no.
Knock on wood. Knock on wood, Knock on wood.
Oh, I can't hear any more of this.
Peter, your dog is giving me diabetes.
Oh, boy, you're not kidding.
I tell you, I wish that old hag of Brian's
had never even told him he had a kid.
Well, wait a minute, Peter.
Maybe that's the answer.
You just gotta get his mother take him back.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
She's an idiot redneck, Peter.
Tricking her should be easier than
escaping from Canadian Alcatraz.
Can I go through here?
Just be back by bedtime.
Okay.
Lunch is ready, everyone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa. Lois, Lois.
This is, this is white bread.
Yeah. So?
Well, don't we have any of that whole-grain stuff?
No. This was cheaper.
I just, I just, I don't want Dylan eating white bread.
Brian, there's nothing wrong with it.
Lois, Lois, I do not want
Dylan eating white bread.
Brian, I promise you, it's fine.
Lois. Lois, Lois I will decide what is best for my child, all right?
Look, will you take it easy?
And, and, I do not want to have
this conversation in front of my son.
Okay, you know what? That's it, Brian.
Feed him whatever you want.
Tell, tell you what.
Go up to my jewelry box,
take my gold jewelry.
Melt it down. Make it into bread
and feed him that.
That good enough?
Gold bread good enough for your Dylan?!
Hey, everybody!
Look at who's back to pick up her son.
This isn't The Price is Right.
You said we were going to The Price is Right.
Peter. What the hell is this?
Mom. What are you doing here?
Tracy wants Dylan back.
Don't you want Dylan back, Tracy?
What a joyous family reunion.
Isn't this great, Brian?
Now Dylan can go back with his mom,
and you can stop acting like
such a jackass.
So that's what this is all about, huh?
I must say, you have been a little
insufferable lately, Brian.
We just want the old you back, that's all.
Look. All right. Okay, maybe I have
been acting different lately, all right?
But that's only because I've truly
connected with the one bit of
flesh and blood that I have on this earth.
And I have no intention of giving that up.
Who wants a half-and-half?
Oh, I'll throw my hat into that ring.
Wait a minute, Dad.
I think maybe I should go with her.
What? Dylan, why?
Look at her. She needs me-
a lot more than you do.
But we were just starting to make a real connection.
Listen.
I'll always be grateful to you for
turning my life around, but
now, thanks to you, I finally
have a chance to transform
my mom's life in the same way
you transformed mine.
You know, I guess a dad couldn't
ask for more than that.
I'm proud of you, Dylan.
My life will never be the
same for knowing you.
Good-bye and...
good luck.
Good-bye, Dad.
Come on, Mom. Let's go.
Bye. Thanks for coming.
I'm gonna miss that boy.
You know, I just finally figured it out.
She looks like a really hot Tim Russert.
Right?
- Right? - Yes.



Title: I Dream of Jesus

Family Guy Season 7 Episode 2 "I dream of Jesus"
Corrected Subtitles !
You know kids, there's a lot of history here. These 50's diners were very popular in the 80's.
Boy, Am I gonna enjoy this meal.
Not like last night when I didn't have time to poop before the guests arrived.
Do I have time? You know what, I'm gonna go for it.
Son of a bitch! Looks like I'm gonna have to pile all dinner on top of... He guys how are you!
Look at  this place. They don't serve any of this 1950's food anymore.
Hamburgers, french fries, cokes. He-he, you kids don't know what I'm talking about.
I love how all the service look like celebrities from the 50's.
Marilyn Monroe. Elvis. And look there's James Dean after the accident.
Can I tell you about tonight's specials?
Oh, look, Cleveland finally made it.
Oh, hey there Griffins.
Oh, that takes me back.
Hey! What are you, a robot?
No son. It's the 1950's and I have polio.
Wow, I've never heard of that before.
Oh yeah Chris. Polio back then was like AIDS today. Except people who have polio get in to heaven.
Oh my God! This is Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen. This is my favorite song of all time.
Chris don't you know about the bird?
Meg, everybody knows that the bird is the word!
Hey, guy behind the counter, the bird is the word!
Hey, frightened little child, the bird is the word.
Lady on the toilet, the bird is the word.
Hey, don't you know about the bird?
Sure, everybody knows that the bird is the word.
Again, Again, I love repetition.
Hey what's the big idea?
This song from the 1960's, it shouldn't be in this jukebox.
Wait wait! Can I have that record? I love that song.
I'll let you have sex with my daughter.
I don't know, let's see what you daughter looks like.
She's... er... right there.
Okay. I'll do her. But can you tell her to cry and beg me to stop?
I think that can be arranged.
Peter will you give this song a rest? You've been playing it ever since we've got home.
No way Lois, it's my new favorite thing in the world.
Argh...
Lois... I'm gonna ask you this only once
Do you or do you not know about the bird?
Oh God!
'Cause everybody's heard that the bird is the word...
Aw...
Oh God! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Look, just go to sleep all right?
Peter, I have a mammogram in the morning.
Brian, can I see that paper for a sec?
Huh... That's odd I thought that would be big news.
You thought what would be big news?
Well there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece.
A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avion variety
What are you talking about?
Oh, have you not heard?
It was my understanding that everyone had heard.
heard what? Brian, don't!
Brian don't you know about the bird?
Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird.
Oh my God! Peter you all right?
Peter I was just at the bank and they told me you withdrew six thousand dollars cash from our savings.
That's almost everything we have! What the hell was it for?
I bought some local TV air time, Lois, and I did a public service announcement of vital importance.
Thank you.
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.
You know there's an issue facing many americans today that I know concerns a great number of us.
According to Gallup polls one in twelve americans is unaware that the bird is the word.
I've for one dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word.
My God! Is it possible.
Have the boys at the lab confirmed this?
Sir! Our math shows that the bird is equal to or greater than the word.
Check it again!
Brian? Yeah.
I don't feel so good.
All right, that's it! We gotta do something about this.
We have got to get that record and destroy it.
Just like that fat person surgery destroyed Star Jones's arms.
I look so good. I lost all this weight.
TAXI!
Coming to show to people how I said how I look.
WHO!? GET IT!?
Who did what, pop?
Yes Peter, what has you upset?
Surfin' bird is gone!
I took it to bed, had sex with it. It fell asleep in my arms and this morning it's gone.
Well Peter, nobody here would steal from you.
Oh, no one had a motive Lois?
You all had a motive, every one here.
You knew that I changed my will and left everything to the record.
And that's why you wanted the record out of the way.
Meg wanted to get a passport for her twin sister to get her out of the country but the record wouldn't allow it.
But Meg didn't count on me discovering she has no twin sister.
And Meg itself was recently released from the sanitarium.
And that's where Chris came into the picture.
So you got it all figured out, do you?
You couldn't leave well enough alone.
You won't fire Chris, you don't got the stomach for it.
I'm sorry dad, I've no idea what  you're talking about.
Well, it sure is odd. A record doesn't just get up and walk away.
Except for my old Allen Sherman record.
If you ain't gonna play me, don't complain when I try to split.
There's a lot of jews out there still get a laugh of a "hello mother, hello father".
Whoo, such heat this morning I don't need this jacket.
Well, a hell with all of you. I'm going downtown and buy another copy of Surfin' Bird.
Peter that's not necessary. I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.
I wouldn't count on it Lois.
Do you have Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen?
No, I'm sorry. A dog and a baby came in and bought all 63 copies.
Damn it, this is third used record store with that same story.
You are... You look familiar. Do I, do I know you?
Did you go into North Providence high school?
No.
You friends with Gary who owns the drycleaners?
No.
Are you Jesus Christ?
No...
Oh my God! You are, you Jesus Christ!
No, I'm not. I'm just a guy working at a record store.
Huh! Well if you're not Jesus Christ, then you won't mind if I pee on this Amy Grant CD's.
Don't...
Aha, you are Jesus.
Yes. I am.
Oh my God! Jesus Christ, the Messiah, you've returned.
You've returned to bring us the good word!
What word?
Jesus Christ has returned to earth. I can't believe it.
The Second Coming.
Will you keep it down? It's not the second coming.
Okay, so what are you doing here?
Well, believe it or not, I pop in every hundred years or so.
Kinda incognito. Just to get away from the family.
Plus the timing seemed good, 'cause my dad just quit smoking and is a little on edge.
Who took my checkbook? Helen! Why is there a pen cap and no pen?
You're the first person to recognize me in two thousand years.
You seem like a nice guy. Hey won't you come over to my house for dinner tonight?
Okay. But I don't get off until 7.
Great! We'll have a blast. After we eat we can watch that youtube footage of xx xx calling moviephone.
Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW.
xxxx.
I'm sorry I didn't catch that.
Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW.
xxxxx.
You have selected "300"
If this is the movie you'd like to see, say yes NOW.
NO!
You have confirmed "300"
Wow! Jesus Christ at our dinner table. I still can't get over it.
I'm actually glad you're all here tonight.
I wanted tell you that one of you will betray me.
Just kidding.
He's doing that thing he did in this story book.
So Jesus finish that story you were telling us.
Oh, all right. So there I was. They just beaten me senseless. Stuck thorns in my head.
Nailed me to the piece of wood. Shoved the spunch full of vinegar in my mouth and killed me.
Then they put me into a hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days.
And come sunday BAM, I rise from the dead.
Okay, that sounds like a naughty weekend but I can top it.
So me and Cleveland and Joe are just wrecked on southern comfort right?
We know we gonna puke but Joe says "Hey let's go see Chronicles of Riddick"
Sat through the whole thing without puking and then I get home wouldn't you know I lost my glasses.
Huh? Peter 1 - Jesus 0
Ah, you know Jesus if I go get myself on, would you mind talking to my friend Mariel Goldman?
I really just want to rub her jewish nose in this.
All right, I'll be the one to say it. How do we know you really Jesus?
Can you perform miracles?
Sure. How about this?
Oh boy! Sundays! I love you Jesus.
I love you too fella.
Hey Jesus can you do something for me?
Sure Peter, what is it?
Say listen Jesus, I know you're trying to keep a low profile but
there's one person I really want you to meet.
Oh yeah, who's that?
The American people may have turned against the war but I answer to a higher power.
I answer to the power of Jesus Christ.
Oh, that's funny, because I happen to have Jesus Christ right here.
I've heard what you were saying. You know nothing of my work.
How you ever got to be president of anything is totally amazing.
Wouldn't it be great if life were like this?
Hey listen Jesus, thanks for coming by tonight and hanging out with us.
You may look like a bum but you've got a lot of talent, young man.
Yeah, I've forgotten how great it is interacting with other people.
Well, I better get some sleep, I gotta open the store tomorrow.
Ah, you don't wanna get back to that record store. You gotta get back out there.
Coloring eggs and hiding them for kids.
What? You mean reveal myself?
Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus. It needs you like the guy who can't get it up needs a distraction.
I'm so ready to have sex with you. Oh, hey is that my phone?
I don't hear anything.
Is that John Aston?
I don't see anyone out there.
Oh, well now, there's so much going on.
You know you're right, Peter. It may be time. But how do we do it?
Everyone, may I have your attention please. I would like to introduce you to the one, the only... Jesus Christ.
That's right. That's Jesus Christ. Right here.
Jesus Christ Yeah right.
Look at these idiots, they don't even listening. You know what, we gotta prove it to them.
Listen, I'm gonna go to that supermarket and get some water and you gonna turn it into wine.
Okay, cool. Can you get me a Cracked magazine?
Cracked?
Yeah.
Jesus Christ unbelieveable. All right, I'll be back.
Ah, crap!
Don't worry, I'll get it.
Ah... Woo... Oh my god... Jesus... It's Jesus Christ...
And his best pal Peter, ah-ah... wow...
15 minutes Mr. Christ.
Wow, Jesus, can you believe you gonna get to meet Jay Leno.
Mom, why is it there when Jesus revealed himself to the world, he became famous and when I did, I've got suspended for 5 days.
You know, I owe this all to you Peter. You gave me the confidence I needed.
Ah, never mind about that pal. You just go out and knock 'em dead.
Now, who are you? Jesus Christ.
Who are you?! Jesus Christ!
WHO ARE YOU?!! JESUS CHRIST!!!
NOW GO GET 'EM!!!
My face again to Dave Coulier. Season 3 of Full House is out on DVD March 5th.
My next guest died for our sins and now it looks like he's back on the scene.
Please welcome from the Bible, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus.
Oh well, Jesus, welcome to the show.
Thanks Jay, glad to be here.
So, Jesus, so what've you been doing since you've been back?
Oh, you know kinda bumming around, playing a little color duty for even a lot of pinkberry.
blah-blah-blah
I've been sampling the night life out here.
I raised River Phoenix from the dead then we went out to the Viper Room and he OD'd again.
blah-blah-blah
Jesus Christ everybody. Will be right back with Joss Stone.
Did you see that? He made Jay Leno laugh. This guy is gonna be huge.
Now back to the MTV Movie Awards hosted by Dane Cook.
Hey everybody what's up? Dane Cook here in da house. At the MTV Movie Awards. what's up?, what's up?.
Hey you know what I hate? When you eat an ice cream cone and it's all like cold.
And you like "Why didn't you warn me that`s so cold?"
And he's like "It's ice cream, dude".
And you like "Oh, man". But chicks don't do that because they use a spoon.
Argh. Watsup. Sufight. Poo. MySpace.
Is he saying something funny?
I don't know but he's moving around a lot, so I guess.
Ha-hah. He was on the internet Neumann college. Ha-hah.
And now to present the award for sickest on screen gangsta pimp bound  ? parisness
Jesus Christ and the pussycat dolls.
Hey Jesus. That's my buddy Jesus.
Boy. Who would've thought, me, Peter Griffin, the guy you just two weeks ago drew a smily face on his own testicle to make his son laugh.
Well, I've lost my train of  thought. But yeah, that's my buddy Jesus.
Hey, It's a pleasure to be here with you, six interchangeable women.
Last time I was down here on earth I only hung around with one whore.
C'mon guys, let's head over to my crib.
Hey, you guys mind scooting over  a little bit?
Oh, sorry Peter, doesn't look like there's any room.
What? What do you mean?
Well, there's only one space left and I promised it to that cow.
This is gonna be so much fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof and wave my arms and go "Whoo, I'm in Hollywood!"
Whoo, I'm in Hollywood! Gee, I've said I'll do it.
Peter, would you put that thing away, we're trying to eat dinner.
I can't believe Jesus hasn't called me back. I left him a message like 4 hours ago.
Well, maybe he doesn't have his phone with him.
No, no, I rang twice and then a voice mail picked up.
If it gone straight to voice mail that means the phone was off.
If I rang like 6 times that means he didn't hear it but I rang twice Lois.
That means a phone rang, he saw it was me and then he pressed a button and sent it straight to voice mail.
You know what, give me your phone, I bet he'll pick up.
Hehey Lois.
Hey you. It's Peter. What the hell we were supposed to do something today.
Ah... Forgot to tell you, I have a doctor's appointment today, I'm actually there now.
Hey look, Lindsay Lohan just took her top off.
Heeey, I just drink a beer, who wants to do me?
I do. Me too. I just did you, but I'll go again.
I gotta go.
Can you believe the way Jesus has treatened me?
I thought he was my friend.
Fame and success do crazy things to people Peter.
I'm sure deep down he's still that same old Jesus.
He may just need to figure that out in his own way.
Maybe. But one thing's for sure Lois.
None of this would've happen if somebody haven't stolen my fucking Surfin' Bird record!!!
Tonights top story: Local record shop employee Jesus Christ was found
in Mary-Kate Olsons apartment this morning face down and unconscious.
Police revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus who was quoted to saying:
"Jews are responsible for all the world's wars"
Brian, you think that's our Jesus?
Griffin's residence, Peter speaking.
Oh yeah?.. Why should I?..
Yeah, well, get someone else to bail you out, 'cause it ain't gonna be me.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do about it?
All right, I'm coming.
Jesus Christ look at you. You've had it all: money, fame, eternal life. And you blew it. You let it all go to your head.
I know Peter. I guess it turns out I'm just as human as anyone else.
Yeah, well, what are we doing now?
You want the truth? I think it's time for me to go.
This world's not ready for me yet and I'm not ready for it.
I don't know. Maybe I'll try coming back in another thousand years when I'm a little more mature.
Well, that's a very mature thing to say right there.
I think you're on your way.
Well, before I go Peter, there's something I wanna give you.
Hold out your hands.
Well, I guess that's it then. Jesus is gone.
I sure am gonna miss him.
Me too. Although he did give me something right before he disappeared.
What?
Something very special Lois.
What is it dad?
What? You haven't heard?
Crap!



Title: Road to Germany

Okay, everyone. Hurry up and hand in you oscar picks before it starts.
Ladies and gentlemen, Scarlett Johanson and for some reason Stewe Bushemi.
Man, look at this Stewe Buscemi.
Everyone of his teeth is in business for itself.
You know, Stewe, the artdirector's job
is never an easy one.
That's right, Scarlett, but this year--
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going to the Elton John party.
What the hell? I told you, we're staying for the governor's ball.
And I told you, Tim, we would see how the evening plays out.
Peter, may I use your restroom?
I took a lots of any stool hardner (?), ooh.
And they're fighting it out in there.
Yeah, it's upstairs, Mort.
Oh, boy! I hope there's scale in there.
I'd like to have before and after on this one.
I'll be out in a minute. I really need to go.
She said she'll be out in a minute.
Oh, I hope there's another bathroom in there.
Oh god!
Oh, thank god, a porto party (?).
Dad, mr. Goldman never drank his Ensure.
Can I have it even know it's dinner time?
Sure Chris. Drink Ensure as a meal. Or inbetween meals.
Or when you're on the go.
- Is Mort still in the bathroom? - I'll go see if he's all right.
Mort?
Hello? Mort?
Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey! What are you doing in my room?
Don't touch my stuff with you dirty walking on the streets paws.
I'm looking for Mort. He came up here an hour ago and never came back down.
- O-oh. - What?
My time machine. It's been activated.
Time machine? I didn't know you've had a time machine.
Yeah, built it after I got bored with that european "see and say".
The pig goes-- Wank!
The cow goes-- Shazoo!
It most certainly does not.
The ruster goes-- Kikkery-gee!
Where? Where does the ruster say that?
The monkey goes-- Ma-kak!
Oh, no-no-no! It does not.
The elephant goes-- Fuamp! Oh yeah, kinda.
Stewie, do you think Mort might have accidently stumbled into the time machine?
Yeah, I suppose it's possible.
Let's ask Rick Moranis and the backup singers from "Little Shop of Horrors"
Da-rum. I saw a red-headed guy come up here about an hour ago.
Mort ...
He seemed to be in a rush and had a pain look on his face.
Had to poop...
And he stepped into that box there and suddenly there was a big flash of light.
That's when he get back in time.
- Oh my god! Stewie we have to get him back. Where did the machine sent him? - I don't know.
How- How can you not know? It's a time machine.
Doesn't it have like display that tells the year or something?
Oh, I'm sorry Brian, is my time machine not as good as your time machine?
Oh, yeah, oh. You probably got a way better time machine. Yeah.
Stupid dog!
Well then-- Can't you just press a couple of buttons and bring him back?
No, he can't just come back. He needs the return pad.
Oh, we can't just leave Mort back in time.
That'd be more irresponsible that silent movie porn.
All right. We'll go get him. But remember Brian, don't touch anything when we're in the past.
Even stepping on a mosquito could create a chain reaction that drastically alters the present.
- Really? - Nah, you can do whatever you want. C'mon!
Okay. If everything worked properly this should be the exact time and place that Mort was sent to.
- Now we just got to figure out where we are. - Or when we are.
Oh, that's such a douche time travellers thing to say.
Shazoo!
Okay. We're somewere in Europe.
Aha! Look Brian! This trail of used tissues should lead us right to Mort.
Or to Quagmire.
Aha-ha-ha-ha. Oh, he's gross.
Warsaw. Well, at least we know where we are.
And so we had encrucified. But this doesn't leave this room.
Anyway, the point is, may Haim and Sarah have many wonderful years together. Amen.
Oh, excuse me! We're looking for mr. Goldman.
Mr. Mort Goldman.
He's a small business owner. Tends to wine a lot. Kinda of hypochondriac.
Oh no, you can't put you hand back up after you put it down. You know-- Never mind.
Stewie look at this. September 1st, 1939.
There's something about that date.
I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazl tov! Now step on the glass.
Oh, but be careful though. At my wedding I cut myself on the glass.
And when I've got to Palm Beach for the honeymoon I had to put a wonder bread bag on my foot to keep the sand out.
Mazl tov!
Oh, Mort, thank god.
Brian and Stewie? You're in heaven too?
Mort, this isn't heaven. You've time travelled into the past.
What? How is that possible?
Just trust me, we're here to bring you back home.
But it's got to be heaven, Brian. Look!
There's my frugal aunt Ruth, my drifty(?) uncle Isaac, my bogen hunting aunt Flo,
and my great aunt Vera, who didn't like to spend a lot on anything.
C'mon Mort, we gotta get out of here.
But Brian, when am I gonna have another chance to see my grandpa Haim's wedding with my own eyes.
Yes, you know, he's right, Brian. Besides, I've never been to hebrew wedding.
Well, I guess we could stay a little longer.
Oh, wonderful. I wanna be hoisted up on the chair and see what it feels like to be top jew.
O-oh.
I knew there was something about this date.
September 1st, 1939. This is the german invasion of Poland.
It's also the exact day and year that Rene Russo was born.
Stewie, we gotta get out of here fast.
- Quick, set up the return pad and let's get back to our own time. - Right.
- What's wrong? Why we're still here? - I don't know.
Stewie, it's not working.
Yeah. And you know what's not gonna fix it? Your shouting.
Aw god! Should we ask somebody for help?
Yeah, right. How many pollocks does it take to fix the time machine? Let's find out.
No, we can't stay here. We'll have to get Mort to England. It's the only place he'll be safe from the nazis.
Oh dear, awful those nazis. If they catch me, they'll beat me unmerciful
and rub dirt my assneck(?) all over my assy nipples.
What?
Juden. Ruber der schmutzen auf deine assneck.
All right, there's the checkpoint. If we can get past it, we're out of occupied Poland.
Right. Mort, you're set?
Oh god. I hope this works.
Hello. We'd like to leave Poland now.
And we'll be bringing our friend, who's absolutely 100% not jewish.
Hey, how about the Jesus, huh? What a guy!
Father, we are so glad you're here.
We needed to conduct last right for our friend over there.
Oh-- Well, ah-- I suppose, eh--
Dear god! Um-- Non jewish god, be a mensch--
I mean a good guy, 'cause it says in the old book-- Not so old though.
You know still good, still good-- Uh, still something good thing to say--
We pray in the name of you and of your son, who died
in a freak accident, that you can't really blame on anyone.
Take this man up to your retail pain place.
Are you sure you are real priest?
Yeah, I can vouch for him, he's real.
He's molested me many-many times.
Sorry, I'm late. I was busy doing-- am--
innocent non-molested things.
Wait a minute. Two priests? That is impossible!
This collier comes right off.
This is a filthy jew!
Oh boy, you, you are, you, you, you should be glad, your HR person was not around here then.
Run!
Hey, poppy, I need to borrow this.
Das poop!
Well, nazis, that's refreshing.
All right, on three we make to the closest U-boat.
Ah, unsere untersee-boot sind stielen mit eine dog und baby und ardga(?) fonkel.
Everybody hang on.
We're being pursued by two objects.
Looks like one's another U-boat.
The other appears to be Terence Trent D'Arby.
Fire!
- O-oh. - What?
Hold on to something.
Brian, I've got an idea.
It's a long shot but it just might work.
- See that newspaper? - Yeah.
Staff it in the waist-tube.
Oh my god! It's England. We've reached England. We're saved.
Ah, London in war time.
This is history right here, Brian.
And look, there's Winston Churchill.
Maybe we'll get an upclose look at his legendary wit.
Ah, Winston, drunk again, I see?
Yeah, well, and you are fat bitch.
Wickedly funny!
Hm, I guess history is just wittled it down to the gyms.
Why isn't the time machine working?
I'm working on it Mort, all right?
- Aw, here's the problem. - What? What is it?
The transfer circuts are powered by uranium and this thing is taped out.
Wait a minute, are you saying we need to find some uranium?
I'm afraid so. But where do we find uranium in WW2 Europe?
There's only one place. At the top secret atomic research facility.
In Berlin.
Wait a minute, germany is building weapons of mass destruction?
Why doesn't it matter then to go there and kick their asses?
I don't know. Maybe because they don't have any oil?
Aw, clap-clap-clap-clap-clap.
I don't know. I don't wanna do this.
Mort, Berlin is the closest place we're gonna find uranium in this time.
It's the only way to get home.
Men, as officers of the royal airforce, you're the very best in the world.
However this mission to Germany will not be an easy one.
Four and a half of every five of you will not return.
Half of Jenson there, I can tell you, it gets pretty sticky(?).
But I've never lost me good spirit sir ever.
So let's get up there, be safe and get back to the big fat pigs of wives we have waiting at home.
Pardon me, sir. I'd like to join.
What are your qualifications?
I have british accent, I'm possibly homosexual, I've never brushed my teeth and my wife is grossly(?).
Bombs away.
- Talk to me, Gus. - Please don't call me that.
You're my eyes, Gus. Keep an eye out for this crowds.
O-oh, germans dead ahead.
Oh no, it's another wave of fighters. We're outnumbered.
Oh no, we're not.
Stand by, my hohmen(?). DIE!!!
Oh my god and baby Jesus, we're going down.
Quick, get the parachutes.
There are no parachutes, all I could find was this.
A raft? We're not sinking.
We're crushing!
There it is. Berlin.
So, this is Berlin, huh? Doesn't seem so bad.
Dear god, this place is nightmarish. Look at the offencive way they draw a jewish people.
It's here. The uranium lab is in here.
Hey, psst, fellas. You wanna get free caricature?
Whooo-- Yeah! I want to be a shcateboarder.
Eh, there's something on here.
Huh, that's weird.
All right, c'mon. Let's get inside that lab.
Hey guys!
- Hitler! - How is it going, mr. Hitler?
Oh, it's a doggy-dog rike(?) and I'm wearing a bacon pants.
So, how's the atomic bomb coming?
It's coming, it's coming. There's some problems,
we have much better luck developing this impressive collection of luftballons.
Oh damn!
Well, I guess we'll just get you back to work.
Oh, I almost forgot, I can suppose you boys have some uranium I could borrow?
Oh, of course. Give him some uranium, Min Joe Green.
Likee. Catch.
Thanks, Min Joe.
He's not really Min at all.
Nah, he's a nice guy.
Okay, the time machine is refuelled.
Let's find a safe spot and make the trip back home.
Arrest him! Arrest all sree.
Zis fills are making a mockery of our Reich. Execute them.
- Unless-- - Unless what?
Unless they can sing a charming musical number.
[sings] Dammit, what are you do? Just get in the fucking time machine.
We did it! We're home. Everything's fine.
- Uh, well, not quite. - What do you mean?
Don't you a little nervous that Mort knows all about this stuff?
Ah, I'm one step ahead of you, Brian.
You see, we've arrived thirty seconds before Mort came up to use the bathroom.
Only this time things are gonna play out a bit differently.
- Can I poop in here? - No!
Too Late.

You guys are gonna love this spa. They give the best massages.
Your whole bodies will feel like Joes legs.
- Wow! - That would be nice for a short period.
I tell you, I need this. I've had a really stressfull morning.
Wait a minute, Doc! Are you telling me
that its 8:25?
- Precisely! - Damn... I'm late for school!
That's the power of love.
Okay. Why don't you just get yourself settled up on that table.
- I'll give you a minute. - Eh... What am I supposed...
- You ready in there? - Yep.
Oh, ha-ha, you put some fake poo on the floor.
Oh no! Get out! Get out! Scam!
Huh, this is more like it.
Is the music okay?
Actually, would you mind tuning it to 97.1?
You listening to the Quiet Storm. Up next the music of the eyes list
Teddy Pendergrass and right now here is some Marvin Gaye
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
Ohhh, this is long overdue.
There's nothing like a good suit massage.
Focus on the lapels. That's where I carry most of my stress.
Okay, here's one. If you were gay
and you had to have sex with either
John Forsythe or Sean Connery, who would it be?
- Oh, that's easy, John Forsythe. - Yeah, John Forsythe.
- John Forsythe, absolutely.
That's so funny, I would also say John Forsythe, I was just curious.
Yeah, I mean Sean Connery is just so... O-oh...
Oh God, I am so sorry!
It's too late. The damage is done.
Hey Chris, you know what I just got?
The boxset of Lord Of The Rings. It's awesome.
Yeah, but you remember the giant eagle they rode in the first one
and then rescues them at the end of the third one?
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, why didn't they just fly the eagle to Mordor
instead of spending three movies walking there.
That's not what it's about, Chris. It's about the quest.
Oh, I'm not arguing that with you, I'm just saying there's hole in the story.
- Huh... Have you ever seen Krull? - No.
Yeah, you don't need to see Krull.
All right guys, the best thing you can do for your body after a massage
is hot coffee, alcohol and slim jims.
Oh, dad, I'm glad you're here.
- There's something I need to ask you. - What is it, Chris?
- Well, um... Today in gym class
I've noticed one of my testicles went up inside my body
and hasn't come back out yet.
And I'm a little scared.
Uh, Sir, this employee just made a sexual remark to me.
No, dad, I'm really worried.
Look, is that normal?
Ah, ah! Sir, sir! Your employee is exposing himself to me!
- But dad! - You got a lawsuit on your hands, mister.
Whoa, whoa, okay, look, look.
If you'd be willing to forget this whole thing happened,
I'll give you this gas card.
Unlimited Free Gas for a year?!
Just 'cause I threatened to sue you?
Well, that and you're not the worst looking guy who's ever come in there.
That's what I wanted to hear!
Wow, Peter, a free gas card!
This could save us a lot of money.
Yeah, everyone except Brian 'cause he bought a Prius, what a dumbass.
What? What? What I miss? Are we laughing at Brian?
Ha-ha, Brian, you're suck!
What the devil is in here?!
Oh, I threw out all your apple juice, Stewie. We're a gas family now.
You put gasoline in Stewie's bottle?!
You damn fool! You're more useless than Aquaman!
Help! Somebody help me! Rape!
Scream all you want, nobody can hear you out here.
I can!
Aquaman, help!
Hey! Hey! Hey, let her go!
Or what?
Or... Or... I don't know man, but...
but you're lucky you're not doing it over here... in the ocean.
Or else... I would stop you.
For God's sake! Help! Do something!
Ah, if you don't like starfish you're gonna be mad about what I just did.
Oh God! Help!
Ah, you're in for it now, buddy. I've got like five fish coming to help.
Aw, aw, here they are.
Help, he's hurting me!
Well, maybe you shouldn't of let him on.
Peter, what the hell is that?
It's a space shulttle, Lois.
I figured, with unlimited free gas I can finally afford to go into space.
Why is it every time I open this door
you seem to be in some ridiculous vehicle you inexplicibly acquired?
I've got this at a NASA auction for next to nothing.
They were gonna scrap it cause of some minor mechanical problem or something.
Instead they sold it to me. Very simple explaination.
I do not want you trying to fly that thing...
you're not even a trained astronaut!
Relax, Lois, nothing bad ever happens to space shuttles.
Now stand back!
[3 days later]
I'm back from space, everybody.
You got lucky, Peter.
How was it, dad?
Oh, mind-boggling, Chris.
Barrelling around the Earth at 5 miles per second.
Watching the sunrise over the Sea of Japan.
It's indescribable.
Plus I've had a lot of time to rub one out which in space is great,
except after a while it's like living in a snow globe.
Peter, instead of wasting your free gas on a series of comedic
stunts why don't use it more constructively?
I mean we can take a family vacation.
That's a great idea, mom.
Hey, maybe we can go to the island from Lost.
No, I don't wanna listen Matthew Fox's heavy breathing.
Keith... You don't get it.
We are the island!
Hand me that paper bag.
Jack, that's got my poop in it.
I know... I know.
It's got a hit of coconut in it.
And something else.
But that's part of the mystery.
All aboard for the Grand Canyon!
I know you're tired, Stewie, but you sleep all you want in the car.
Uh, 6 am. I shouldn't have stayed up all night listening to persian radio.
Hey, that was Roxette with You've got the look.
It's 21 o'clock and still 27 Centigrade out there.
Huh, that's hot.
So, if you're cruising along the left side of the road at a 120 km
per hour in zis kheavy desert, turn up the decibels
'cause it's Shaleb Mame with Zeheh Maleh
on 103.2. The Hukh!
What's with all those birds?
My tropical bird collection... Just in case.
Just in case what?
We're not gonna need a dozen tropical birds.
Oh, I was not aware that you can see the future, Lois.
Can I go ahead and get tomorrow's lottery number?
Stupid woman.
Peter, you are not putting those birds in the car.
Oh, well then I guess we're not going on vacation.
Oh, good, then I'm going back to bed.
All right, Peter, you can bring this stupid birds.
Yeah, you're letting me be myself.
All right, everybody, let's go!
All right, everybody, off we go!
We are gonna have such a great time...
- Hello. - Hey, Peter, what's up?
Hey, Quagmire, just taking the family on vacation.
Oh, that's good.
Oh, hang on a second, I'm stuck behind some fatass driving too slow.
C'mon stupid, move it!
Hang on, Quagmire, some jerk behind me is honking his horn.
Oh, you should totally flip him off!
Oh, hang on a sec, some fatass just flipped me off!
Hey, up yours, you jerk!
Hang on, Quagmire, I've gotta kick this guy's ass.
Yeah, I've gotta kick this guy's ass!
- Hey, I'll call you back after the fight. - Yeah, me too.
- Good luck in yours. - Good luck in yours.
Lois? I'm awake, Lois.
Lois!
Lois?
Where the devil is everyone?
This place is more deserted than James Gandolfini's workout room.
Just waitin' for my breakfast.
Lois!!!
I know how to get her attention.
Lois, I'm about to drink my first soda, better come stop me.
Mmm, that must be the sugar.
Oh God, that's good!
Rupert, suddenly I want to run! Chase me!
Oh, now I'm sad.
Brian, do me a favor and check on Stewie, would you?
He's fine.
Hey, what do you say we sing a driving song?
Some say Love-e-e...
It is a river...
That drowns...
The tender reef...
Some say Love-e-e...
It is a razor...
That leaves your soul to bleed...
When the night has been too lonely...
And the road has been too long...
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong...
Just remember...
In the winter...
Far beneath...
The bitter snows...
Lies the seed that with the sun's love...
In the spring...
Becomes the rose...
Okay, that was good, that was good!
Chris, I think you were a little early at start of bar 4.
I don't know. How'd that sound from your end?
Sounded great out here. You want another?
No, if that's works for you, we're fine.
- All good on my end. - All right, that's a take.
There's no sign of them anywhere!
Meg? Chris? Brian?
They're gone! I'm all alone!
I can do whatever I want!
I'm gonna take Brians novel
and replace every use of the word "and" with the word "fart".
"The young soldier fart his brother looked at each other
fart both knew that with love fart truth fart courage
they would both emerge st-fart-ing on their feet."
Eh, that one didn't work.
Well, let's see what facinating pubescent treasures
Chris has got hidden away.
Ooh, Hustler Magazine!
I finally get to see what a vagina looks...
Oh God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
You... Can't hurt... Anyone...
Anymore...
[Ground zero]
Why are we in New York?
I thought we were going to the Grand Canyon.
Well, I just thought we should stop and pay our respects.
Ground zero.
So this is where the first guy got AIDS.
Peter, this is the site of 9/11 terrorists' attacks.
- Ah, so Saddam Hussein did this? - No.
- The Iraqi army? - No.
- Some guys from Iraq? - No.
That one lady who visited Iraq that one time?
No. Peter, Iraq had nothing to do with this,
it was bunch of Saudi-Arabians, Lebanese and Egyptians
financed by a Saudi-Arabian guy living in Afghanistan
and sheltered by Pakistanis.
So, you're saying we need to invade Iran?
Wake up, Stewie, let's get you out of that seat and into a fresh diaper.
Oh my God!
Peter, Stewie's not in the car!
Oh my God, we must have left him at home!
Oh my God.
That... Is... Hilarious.
He is probably freaking out.
God, I would give anything to see his face right now.
He's... He's probably all like "Whe... Where the deuce is everyone?".
Well, I can't really do a good Stewie.
Oh my God, what kind of a mother am I?
Peter, we gotta go home right now!
Oh great, Lois. Now we gotta bail on the whole vacation. This sucks!
Now every time I come back to this place
it's gonna be associated with one particular bad memory.
Actually we could call Quagmire and Cleveland.
They can go over and check on Stewie.
They'll probably even be willing to look after him 'till we got home.
Well, okay, I guess so.
Yeah, Quagmire and Cleveland are great with kids.
Like Robin Williams in Patch Adams.
Huh. Everybody's lying around in here. Liar, liar, pants on fire.
What am I in congress? Ho-ho. See, laughter is the best medicine.
Please, sir, I'm in so much pain!
Shut up and listen to my material!
Huh, what's this? Bedpan? Peter pan?
Oh, next stop is Neverland. Come Wendy, fly with me. Ho-ho.
Hmm, I've never executed a diaper change before.
Of course how hard could it be? You just unfasten these things
and lay back with your legs in the air and let nature do the rest.
Hm, it's still there. Usually the doodey's disappeared by now but it hasn't.
Intruders!
Stewie, you in there?
You think he's here?
Oh God, it's Cleveland and Bob Hope.
Oh well, the damage is done. Better get 'em out of here.
Perhaps I'll shackle them in the basement.
With a 24 hour broadcast of the DirecTV help channel.

This maybe kinda messed up but...
Am I the only one getting a boner right now?
Is there anything that doesn't give you a boner, Glenn?
People are used the word "rubbish" when they mean garbage.
- Really? - Yep. Not even a wiggle down there.
Your shows will appear on My Playlist.
Peter, it's been 8 hours and I haven't heared from Cleveland or Quagmire.
I even tried Joe.
This is my wheelchair! There are many like it but this one is mine!
Without me my wheelchair is useless!
Without my wheelchair I am useless!
- Shut up! - Okay.
This sucks! I wanna see the Grand Canyon!
I'm sorry but we are not leaving Stewie by himself.
We're going home.
No way! Those guys have TV in their car!
He-he. They're watching Operation Dumbo 6 with Don Nuts.
Professor, you've got to impregnate this elephant
or the entire species will become extinct.
You mean I gotta put this thing in that thing?!
Well, this is the job that's not worth the money!
Peter, watch the road!
Lois, get off my back, will ya? I'm trying to watch TV.
I swear to God, sometimes I think your head's screwed on backwards...
I mean, do you have any idea...
Hey, crashy, what are you doing down there?
Well, Rupert, we're out of food, diapers and just about everything else.
Which means I've got to get a job.
otherwise we'll be in worse shape than Morbidly Obese Albert.
Hey, Morbidly Obese Albert, we brought you some chocolate.
Huh, I can't eat those chocolates on account of my diabetes.
Remember, they had to take my foot?
Look it on the bright side, now you get your shoes half-price!
Alright, maybe I'll have one.
Welcome to McBurgertown. Can I take your order?
Stewie, you've got to clean the bathroom!
No, no! I'm not going back in there.
Stewie, I'm not giving you a choice. You've got to go clean that up.
No! No! It was literally only on the floor.
All right? There was no attempt to get near the toilet.
It's like they just... Pressed their buttocks against the wall.
The only part of the floor that didn't have poo on it
- was the part that had baby on it. - Go!
Peter, did you get the train tickets?
Uh, actually no, Lois.
There was a guy inside selling shower curtain rings,
so I bought a bunch of those.
Peter! That was last of our cash!
These ones have helium in them, so they're very light.
You are unbelieveable!
The last four days have been a living hell!
Our baby is at home all by himself yet instead of getting us home
you've managed to make things worse at every turn!
A monkey would be a refreshing step up from you!
A monkey would talk less!
Here's a little tip.
If your instinct tells you to do something, don't do it.
If your instinct tells you not to do something,
it's probably the right thing to do!
You wanna hurt me?
Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better.
I'm an easy target...
Yeah, you're right.
I talk too much.
I also listen too much.
I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you.
But I don't like to hurt people's feelings.
You think what you want about me, I'm not changing.
I like... I like me.
My kids like me.
My friends like me.
'Cause I'm the real article.
What you see is what you get.
Movie references.
Guys! I found us a ride to Quahog in the back of a truck! Hurry!
Ah, thank God!
C'mon let's head home before Stewie gets hurt
like Fozzie Bear when he went to Saudi Arabia.
Eh, It's good to worship Allah 'cause I used to worship Summer!
Wakka-wakka.
I once know a guy who was so arab...
How arab was he?
Eh, he was so arab that
everybody liked him and there was nothing funny about him at all.
Stewie, can I see you in my office for a second?
Oh, yeah, what's up, Eric? Everything's ok?
Yeah, just come into my office.
Stewie, Shiwanda said she saw you sneaking food.
Whaaaat?
She said she saw you in the back of the kitchen sneaking a fish sandwich.
Oh, come on! Dude!
Yes, okay. But the thing was five minutes past the throw out time.
Well, be that as it may. Shiwanda took these pictures on her cellphone.
You're fired.
We're broke, Rupert.
I'm jobless, there's no food left
I'm out of diapers and I'm down to Meg's last hat.
We're doomed, you know.
Let it be written on my tombstone
That my life was considerably better with my family around.
And I didn't realize it until it was too late.
Mommy! Daddy!
Chris! Dog! Brian!
They're home!
Oh, mommy, thank God you're home!
Ah, Stewie, my baby!
I promise with all my heart that I'll never say or do
anything bad to you for the rest of the evening.
By the way, I disabled the V-chip and I've watched so much porn.
Ah, sweetie, I'm so glad you're all right.
Yeah, no thanks to Cleveland and Quagmire.
Wonder what the hell happened to them.

We now return to Jackass.
Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville and I'm gonna take a shotgun blast to the face.
Okay. Ready?
These guys are hilarious. They do so much funny stuff.
Hey. You know what. We should try some of that stuff. Here, at home.
I don't know Peter. That scull and crossbones warning before show us pretty clear about not doing that.
Cleveland, shut up. I saw something on TV that I want to imitate.
Peter, what are you-- What are you boys doing up there? Get off the roof!
Go back in the house, Lois. We're being Jackass.
- Okay, ready? - All right, we're rolling.
I'm Peter Griffin and this is shopping cart--
Roof-- Roo-- Roof-- roofsho-- roof shopping cart.
Guys-- Okay, go!
Aw. Aw. Aw.
Oh my god! Are you okay?
I don't know. I don't know. What is it look like?
Wha-- What do I do? Aw. Ah, ah, what is that?
What is that? I feel something.
It's your spine, dude. It got like you ate down a bunch of nachos.
I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm sca--
Oh god!
This is get fixed with ice or heat?
Ice now, heat later.
I'm Glenn Quagmire and this is bee-bush.
All right, what did you do to yourself, Quagmire?
Well, I just covered my entire private area with honey.
Now we're just waiting for the bees. Giggity.
All right, here they come.
Heh. Okay. Okay, they're on there. Just-- just nobody move.
All right, nobody-- nobody do nothing, don't wanna-- don't wanna make 'em mad.
Stop it! Knock it off!
Yeah, we wouldn't want the bees to get mad.
I hate you bees.
Oh, stop! Stop! Knock it off! Knock it off!
I'm serious, stop! Stop! Stop! Just stop!
All right, that's enough! That's enough. Just-- get them off.
Get them off. Put them back in the hive.
Yeah, all right, enough is enough. Cleveland, open the hive.
All right, Quagmire, bring them over here.
Oh my!
Argh! What the fuck?!
Why would you do that?
Hey, you guys, Lois says it's time for dinner.
Peter, this is not safe at all.
Shut up, Brian. Just keep filming. Okay.
I'm Peter Griffin and I am the Greatest American Hero.
My special power is being somehow memorable after a very short run on TV.
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
- Get some, Peter! - Nice job at that ramp, Joe.
There's one thing I know. It's ramps.
Wait a minute guys, I think he's really hurt.
Help! Help, I think my arm is broken.
Aw! My back! I can't move.
I though-- I was gonna die.
You know, Peter, I'd expect this kind of behaviour from you
but you have no business endangering Brian like that.
Thank you, Lois.
I mean he jumped into that lake to try to save your life and he's 8 years old, Peter.
8! That's 56 in human years.
Okay, Lois.
Why do you think he almost drowned?
He's old, Peter. Plus he drinks and smokes all the time
so take that 56 and make it 79 at least.
Why you making such a big deal out of this, Lois? I was just a little tired.
Yeah, well that's how it begins, Brian. Then the next thing you know
I'm making Peter dig a hole in the yard and you're in the pillowcase.
Peter, what's wrong? You've been so quiet all day.
Ah, it's just what you said the other day, Lois.
I'm starting to think you might be right.
Brian's getting old.
He's not the dog he used to be and-- I'll have to get used to it.
Just like I've got to used to my acrylic nails.
Stainian wine, Stock and Riceman.
Hey, Loranda.
No, I've got 4 people on hold but I can talk.
Good morning, everybody. Brian, I have something to say.
I'm sorry I've been so preoccupied with your age.
Well-- Look, Peter-- Don't worry, just let's forget about it.
Fantastic. And to help us forget about it
family, I'd like to introduce-- New Brian.
Hey, gang! Whose leg do you have to hump to get a hug around here?
Oh, I like him.
- You got a new dog? - Yes, sir!
But-- I'm the dog.
Well, now you getting old and New Brian's here to take some of the load off.
- Can he do tricks? - Oh, you bet!
He's trained to fetch, roll over, and make you feel realy good about yourself.
Well, Meg and Chris, I can't decide which one of your hats I like better.
I-- I can't believe you've got a new dog. What about me?
Hey, you still my buddy. New Brian is just a new friend for the family.
Trust me, you guys are gonna get along better that Abraham Lincoln and his neighbour.
Hey, Dale. I've noticed lawn's getting a little high.
Yeah, I used to have a guy for that.
Dick!
Okay now, you have a good one.
My word, what a gorgeous way to wake up.
I hope you don't mind. I checked the time your alarm was set for and I shut it off.
I figured this might be a more gentle way to start off the day.
Ah, that is so thoughtful, New Brian.
I'll start up again in 9 minutes.
Hey, Meg. I know how you like to let off steam once in a while, so I've got you a journal.
You got me a journal?
Actually, I got you two of them: my right ear and my left ear. Fire it away.
Dear diary. Today at the school library I saw a picture in National Geographic of a woman
with nipples that cover most of her breast too.
And suddenly I didn't feel so alone.
You know what it sounds like to me?
Sounds like the woman on that picture was pretty beautiful.
All right, I'll see you at dinner. Take fast.
Wow! Deodorant! Are you sure, I'm old enough?
Oh, I think so. I'm gonna make you a little less gross every day.
Hey, New Brian. Ah, you have a guitar.
Yep. In fact I wrote a new song today and I want to hear what you think of it.
Where did you find the time for that?
Peter, inspiration doesn't have a schedule.

[sings]
Hey, Brian. I went out for a run this morning and I found this sitck.
I thought you might like it.
Wow. Thanks a lot.
And I've got you some of this. I don't smoke it myself but I sure won't judge you.
Gosh! Thanks!
Check you later, handsome guy.
Well, you know, I wasn't sure about this new dog thing at first
but I've gotta tell you, he's a really terrific guy.
You poor damn fool.
- What? - You have no idea what's going on here.
He's not just a delightful new friend for the family.
He's your replacement!
Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
You're getting old, Brian, and they know it.
You no longer the cover girl. Look at Carol Alt.
Tha-- That's-- You're Carol Alt.
So? I'm through listening to you.
Fine. Think what you want, aging supermodel Carol Alt.
Carol, come in here. They saying your name on the Family Man.
- What? - Huh?
- What? - Huh?
- What? - I forget.
And besides, Brian, the evidence is all right in front of your nose.
That's hilarious, New Brian.
Now do your impression of Punky Brewster's father.
Punky!
Oh, Punky.
Oh, Punky.
You have a dog named Brandon.
Hey, I'm Carol Alt for Polygrip.
They did it again!
- Who? - The Family Man.
- Is that the one with the fish? - No, that's American Boy.
Okay, relax Brian, there's no way they'd replace you.
But it probably couldn't hurt to remind them how much they value you as a family member.
Okay, everybody, tonight I've got a real treat for you.
We've all see you compilation video, Brian.
Shatner singing Rocketman, drunk Orson Welles during that commercial
Silvester Stallone in that porno, and Bill Cosby beating up that midget.
Well, I don't remember that last one.
Oh yes, freakin' brutal, for no reason.
You know, poor little guy just sitten there eating a snack pack
Bill Cosby just runs in out of nowhere and just starts wailing on him.
Didn't that guy died?
No, no, these are home movies from when I was a puppy.
- He died. - Okay, look, just watch.
[Keep off the grass]
Ah, look at him sleep.
Oh, I wander what he's dreaming about.
Shut up, Meg.
- Did you hear that? - He farted.
Just like in the song.
Argh, what the hell is the matter with you? Outside, outside, now!
Well, I hate to say "I told you so" but--
Wait a minute, I love saying "I told you so".
Doi! Hey, Stewie Griffin, meet Stewie Griffin.
Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.
Great outfit. Oh, go on. No, it is.
So what if they have a new dog? Lots of families have two dogs.
Hey, Brian, I thought maybe we could spend an afternoon together?
Really? That'd be great!
Awsome! 'Cause I've got this new gun.
Here we go.
And I thought we could go deep in the woods.
Where noone would ever think to look.
Oh, boy!
And a-- just shoot it.
Awkward.
You know, like so far in noone can hear a gunfire.
Little on the nose.
Or screaming.
Uh, I don't think so, Peter.
Jesus, looks like he thinks I'm gonna shoot him.
He acted all crazy like Quagmire when he drunk dials me.
- Hello. - Hey, wha-- what are-- what are you doing?
- Quagmire, I'm sleeping. - Yeah, I was just out with Joe. Wha-- what are-- what are you doing?
- I just told you. - Aw, that's right, I just-- I just asked that. I forgot.
Hey, hey, this song made me think of you, so wa-- listen to this song.
--awesome? - You said you weren't gonna call him.
It's not him, you big bully.
Joe-- Joe told me not to call you.
- So w-- so wha-- so what's you doing? - Sigh.
Everyone, I have an announcement to make.
I've decided, I'm leaving.
What? Leaving? Brian, why?
Well, you know, I feel like I've sort of-- ran my course here and
you know, besides there's whole big world out there and it's time I saw it.
But-- Brian, you live here, this is your home.
I know but I thought about this long and hard and--
Long and hard.
I am sorry, Brian, please, please, continue.
This is just something I have to do.
Well, where will you go?
Well, I haven't decided that yet but I promise I'll be in touch.
Wait, how is that one dirty?
It's-- I was remembering long and hard.
Well, if your mind is made up about this, Brian, then I wish you the best of luck.
I hope this move won't be a boner for you.
- Peter? - Huh?
- What? - I was just saying to Brian, I hope this move won't be a boner.
I-- I would agree. I hope he finds what he's looking for.
Okay-- Well-- We gonna miss you, Brian.
Hey, everybody, let's watch this tape.
Okay, now there's the midget just sitting there.
Now watch the left side of the screen.
I'm in a bad mood and I'm gonna take it out on you.
Oh my god, well, he's obviously drunk.
Aw! Aw, you're hurting me.
About which I do not care very much.
- Pancake? - Just a small one, thanks.
My god, these are the best pancakes I've ever had.
I bet Brian would love these pancakes.
I wander where he is.
He's next door with Cleveland.
I saw him on my morning paper route.
You know, I appreciate you letting me stay with you but
I'm perfectly capable of going into the bathroom by myself.
Sorry, but there's leash in this neighbourhood and you never know who's watching.
I'm watching you make stool.
Hey, New Brian. Oh, I see you're having pie.
You know, pie isn't really pie without coolwhip.
Everything's better with coolwhip.
- Did you heared what I said? - Yeah, what about it?
It doesn't bother you the way I pronounce it?
- Coolwhip. - No, why would it?
Coolwhip. I'm putting emphasys on the H.
Sounds right to me.
Nothing ever bothers you, does it?
No, not really, I like everything.
God, he's bigger buzz kill than Buzz Killington.
Stewie. Do you know why W.S. Gilbert was frequently drunk on his transatlantic crossings?
No.
Because he was quartered on the port side.
Now that I've got you, let's both revisit the birth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
Okay, New Brian, you're next.
Oh no, oh boy, all right.
Well, I can't do this alone. Lois, I'm gonna need your help here.
Okay, Rita Coolidge's less talented sister here.
I what way is that a joke?
Okay, then you start.
I-- I don't know-- Am I blue or am I red?
You're blue, you're blue.
Okay, I'll do it then.
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
[sings]
Thanks for letting me stay, Glenn. I hope I'm not in the way.
No, no, should be fine. But-- listen, Brian.
I'm gonna be bringing a puerto-rican girl over here later
and she's superhot and real nice but
when she was five years old her dad ran over one of her legs with his van
and it's still kinda messed up in a pretty obvious instantly visible way and uh--
please don't say anything and--
try to make eye contact with her when she waddles in because I want this to work.
Uh-- Yeah. Sure. No problem.
I'm serious, Brian, that leg is a trainwreck.
I mean she herself is so pretty but--
that thing just looks like a string of sausages with one empty casing in 'em.
- I get it. - I mean it's quite a sight.
You know, when she's not looking you should take a look at it but
but, good god, be discreet.
Yeah, I'll uh-- I'll check that out.
Stewie, what are you doing here?
Brian, you've gotta come back.
- Why? - Because.
New Brian is such a tool.
I mean he's-- he's so damn sweet and saccharine and
perfect and he's turnin the family in to the bunch of douches.
No big deal, you've always told me I was a douche.
Yeah. But you were my douche, Brian. My douche.
Come back and be my douche again.
Hi. I'm looking for Glenn.
Argh! What happened to your leg?
Damn it, Brian.
Come back home, Brian.
I tell you what, when this is all over, I'll make you some pie with a nice dollop of coolwhip.
There it is again, why you putting so much emphasys on the H?
That's exactly why I miss you, Brian.
Forget it, I'm going back as long as that new dog is there.
As long as he's a part of that family there's no place for me.
Can't say I blame you, I hate him as much as you do, Brian.
He's a bad fit. Like a crocodile at the alligator rally.
Yeah, lurking in the water with our eyes poken out.
Yeah!!!
Sneaking up on a crane or an egret and snapping our jaws on it.
Yeah!!!
And sometimes walking out on to a dry plane
or dusty field because it's nice to get out of the swamp now and then.
Yeah!!! Wa-- Wait. What?
Dry plane. Dusty field.
Nice to get out of the swamp.
What a crock!
And that's where we get the term.
Hey, New Brian, bad news. You got to leave.
Huh? What are you talking about? This is my home.
Nobody likes you here, man.
Well, I disagree, I think everybody likes me.
No, we don't. We don't like your cooking, your stupid karaoke nights,
and we especially don't like the way you humped that chair in the den.
Well, Rupert seems to like my humping.
What did you said?
Rupert. Humped him for two hours yesterday.
He just laid there and took it.
- Did he? - Yeah!
And now every time you sleeping with him, he's gonna be thinking of me.
And that is why I killed myself
chopped myself up and put myself in the garbage.
Well, he must have had some demons.
Oh my god, suicide. How could we misjudge him so severly.
Often times it's the one who seem a happiest.
Well, the upside is at least we have our Old Brian back.
From now on, buddy, you're the only animal I care about.
Hey, everybody, I'm Bernie the hamster.
Would you like to be my friend?
Aaaah, oh my god--
It's okay, Peter.
Yeah, oh my god, oh my god, it's hamster--
We'll talk about it, when you want to talk about it.
I don't blame you.
I-- I don't blame you.



Title: Tales of a Third Grade Nothing

Family Guy 7x06 - Tales of a Third Grade Nothing
Timing: Razzzma Script: reaper http://FamilyGuyRussia.com/
[Pawtucket brewery]
Griffin, I need you to run this shipping report upstairs to the CEO.
Huh? There's nothing fun or entertaining about that.
Maybe if I walk down the hall with the wisecracking Rebe.
Do you charge a lot for your circumcisions?
No, I just keep the tips.
All right, where's the CEO office.
[Executive bathroom]
Yeah, I always wanted to sit inside of the executive bathroom.
Executive bathroom, sir?
Uh-- Yes.
Right this way.
So, eh-- Where is this executive bathroom?
There!
Welcome to Executive Bathroom Island!
[Executive Bathroom Island]
Well, this is peaceful.
Good morning, Lois.
Wow, Peter, since when do you get such dressed up for work?
Since I got tired of getting nowhere in this world, Lois.
I have decided to do whatever it takes to becoming executive.
Well, it would certainly be great if you got a promotion.
You'd earn more money, get better health insurance.
Lois, I am doing this for the bathroom.
And I'm not giving up on my dream like I did with that indoor hot air balloon.
And away we go.
No, no, no, no, no, noooo.
- I can't feel my legs! - Welcome to the party, pal.
- No, wait, here they are. - Uh--
[Quahog Cabana] [Tonight: Franck Sinatra Jr.]
Call it hell, call it heaven
It's a probable twelve to seven
that the guy's only doing it for some doll
some doll! some doll!
the guy's only doing it for some do-o-o-oll
Boy, it sure is great to have you back in town, Franck.
Yeah, but this place is dead.
I don't know, that one guy seem to like it.
I like everything. Including ginger ale.
Pssst. That's my way of ordering a ginger ale.
Sorry, I can't pay you more, guys, but business has been bad.
I'm actually looking to sell the joint.
Oh, you can't sell this place. So few clubs play real music anymore.
Well, you wanna buy it? I'll give you a good deal.
You know, that's not a bad idea.
Yeah, we could really turn this place around.
If we play our cards right, this could be bigger than the Appolo Theater.
All right now, next up we get the comedy style, it's Kim Li Song, give it up.
How you doing tonight?
So, you ever noticed when two black guys coming into your convinient store
and one go one way and one go the other way?
What they doing? What they stealing? Who with me?
W-o-o-o-o
You stay out of my store! All you stay out of my store! I remember your face!
[Pawtucket brewery]
Peter, I want you to retype those--
Wow! What is this? Have you been cleaning?
Yep! I'm working extra hard, so you'll promote me.
Well, based on your track record you'll understand if I have trouble believing you.
Believe it, Angela, I hate being just a cargo around here.
Almost as much as I hate homeless people asking me for money.
- Spare some change. - Sure.
You didn't put anything in there.
Yes I did. I put hope in there.
Hope.
Don't spend it all in one place, raggie.
[Pawtucket brewery]
Griffin, what the hell is this?
It's a robot that I built to save this company money.
Now, before you say anything,
one, it has no human emotions,
and two, its prime directive is never to harm people.
Oh god! It's harming people.
Angry! Angry!
Oh god! It's got human emotions too.
It's using tools. It's learning, Angela, it's learning. Run!
[Pawtucket brewery]
What are you want, Griffin?
Angela, look out your window.
You see that Anheuser Busch billborad next to the children's hospital?
Well, watch this.
Oh god!
Oh my god, this is horrible.
Oh god! Oh that's terrible.
Oh, good lord, save them. Bless the--
Aw, oka, okay, yeah! Here we go! Now, everything worked out.
Stewie, guess what.
Franck and I just closed the deal to buy the Quahog Cabana club.
Oh, well, Brian, what else are you doing such terrible and stupid?
Just wait, in a few weeks that club will be the hottest spot in Quahog.
Huh, you're deluting yourself.
You're gonna fail faster than John Maddens wedding video business.
[Mike and Stacy's Wedding]
Boom, here's your groom over here.
Boom, you got your bride right here.
A lot of people says Stacy's no good
and she slept with this guy
and then that guy,
and even this guy.
Well, tell you something, that experience's gonna work in her favor later in the game.
You know, what a hack of a wedding? Brad Farve.
[Pawtucket brewery]
Griffin, I've got good news.
Our management level position has become available
and I've seen that you've been working very hard lately.
I'm recommending you for a promotion.
- Ah, and I could use the executive bathroom? - Of course.
Holy crap! You know, last week I ate a fortune cookie and it said
"Obvious lesbian will bring great news"
And also said "A great piano will fall on me".
Well-- Good day to you.
And I will, um--
Yeah, I mean, we're-- we're done.
Just eh-- squeeze by you here.
[Pawtucket brewery]
[Human resources]
Hi, is this where I get the poop pass to use the executive bathroom?
Sit down, mr. Griffin. We need to talk.
Okay, well, make it fast, 'cause I'm starting to crown.
Mr. Griffin, all our executives require a high school education.
And your file says that you never passed the third grade.
If you want this promotion, you're going to have to go back and finish.
Well, that sounds hilarious but it also sounds like it might take a while.
I'm afraid that's your only option.
Well, I mean, if that's what I got to do, then I guess I--
Next time you got a fortune cookie don't open it.
Bye, you guys, have fun at school.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, Peter, stop pouting.
All you got to do is finish third grade and you'll get that promotion.
Grrr, this is gonna be the bigger pain in the ass than getting into "Last Clap" contest with Cleveland.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Quahog mens chorus.
Hey, hey, hey! Clap one more time, you're not coming to my birthday.
- Who did that? - Giggity.
[Martin Mull elementary]
Good morning, class. Starting today we have a new student.
Peter, would you like to introduce yourself?
Hi, my name's Peter Griffin, um--
I was actually in third grade a long time ago but I've never finished.
Back then we had a teacher named mrs. Wilson.
Except-- Except we had this funny little nickname for her.
We called her mrs. Killson. 'Cause she had an abortion.
I know, I know, it's kinda silly but we were-- You know, we were just a bunch of kids.
I'm sorry, go ahead, mrs.-- uh--
Wilson. Thank you, Peter.
Why don't you sit over there, next to Omar?
Omar is our top student
and we're hoping he'll lead us to victory next week in the district "Spelling Bee".
What are you doing in our class? You're old. Are you stupid or something?
Aw, picking on a new kid, huh?
Well, at least my parents didn't name me Gaymar.
Wow! I never knew you can make fun of someone for being homosexual.
And by laughing at other people's sexuality
somehow I feel better of it at my own.
[Quahog Cabana] [Grand re-opening]
Hey, Brian, where are all the people?
They'll be here, Franck. We just got to give them time.
And wouldn't you know it, there's our first customer.
I'll entertain him while we wait for more to arrive.
So, thanks for coming. How are you doing tonight?
Good.
Glad to hear it. Any requests?
Play on the dark side
like John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band.
Give it up, Brian, noone wants to go to a stupid big band club anymore.
You know, I could help you make some changes around here that would bring in customers.
You know, Brian, we should give Stewie a shot. It can't hurt.
Well, what do you have in mind?
Just trust me, Brian, I know exactly what to do.
You've got to be aggressive.
Even more aggressive than Michael Jackson's treatment of his own groin on stage.
Thank you.
[Martin Mull elementary]
All right, Suzie. What have you brought in for Show and Tell?
This is my Malibu Barbie doll that I got for Christmas this year.
She comes with a hairbrush, a pocketbook and two different dresses.
Oh my god! Who the hell cares?
Peter, I would like to remind you that you are in a classroom.
Not for long.
Can I help you, sir?
Hi there, my name's Glenn Griffin. Um, I'm here to pick up my son Peter for a ball ga--
Uh, doctor's appointment.
- Peter is your son? - That is affirmative.
Because you look a lot more like that child over there.
- Daddy? - Oh god!
- Daady? - Oh god!
- Papa? - Oh god!
- Hey, there are no kids in here, right? - No, just me.
Oh, thank god!
You wanna have unprotected sex?
[pLace]
What the hell did Stewie do to this place?
Hey, get a load of Meaner J. Cribbs(?) over here
he's rubbing the records with his hand.
Hey! Hey! You gonna ruin that, you know.
He-hey, there they are.
Stewie, what is all this? What did you do to the Cabana Club?
Ew, we don't call it the Cabana Club anymore, Franck. It's now called pLace.
Little P, big L.
Congratulations! You two now own the hottest spot in town.
Wow, that's a lot of people. I hope we have enough rhye(?).
How'd you pay for all this?
I got a job as a field reporter for Channel 5 News.
And all the juice is being collected underneath?
Yes. And whoever collects the most is gonna win a free weekend
here in the chateau with interhational food and wine tastings.
Stop!
Oh, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Oh, gosh, I-- I hope he's all right.
Well, we'll have to send someone to make sure that he is.
[Martin Mull elementary]
- Hey, Omar, want a Hurt's donut? - Um-- Okay.
Hurts donut.
Dumbass.
Wow, he effectively silenced Omar by hitting him in the face.
My dad hits me but I bet, if I hit others, the pain stops.
Someday I'll use what I've learned here on my wife.
Peter, is this your homework?
Eh, hold on, let me take out my reading glasses.
[Homework is for buttlickers]
Yeah, that's mine.
I could flank you for this.
But buttlickers is three syllable word.
Not even Omar can spell those.
So, you're joining him at next weeks districts "Spelling Bee".
I you'll lead our school to victory, I'll let you pass third grade.
But if you lose, you fail.
I accept that challenge.
Light 70's Bruce Jenner, take me home.
Hup on, Peter.
So, Brian, how is it feel to own the coolest club in Quahog?
You think this is cool? Look at these people.
I'd rather go bankrupt than cater to pretentious jerks like this.
Wow, Brian, slow down, man.
We're making money now and besides this place ain't no bad.
Hey, you girls thirsty? Could I interest you in a couple of Rob Roys?
What's a Rob Roy?
Only V drink of Mr. Peter Lawford.
Who's Peter Lawford?
What am I hitting on Lou Costello here?
Who's Lou Costello?
Uh, sorry, my-- my friend's a little new at the club scene.
Geez, what the hell's with this broads(?)?
Look at you two, taxes in the night club?
Got, you're more out of place than Prince was on Price's right.
And what's your bid on the dining room said, Prince?
Three-fifty.
- I'm sorry? - Three--
Can you speak up, please.
Three-fifty.
All right and the actual retail price of the dining room said is
- three hundred fifty dollars. - Yeeeah.
Peter, wake up!
Oh, Lois, I've just had a weirdest dream
that Louis Black told jokes that was so funny he had to shout them so everyone could hear.
Peter, you got to stay awake, the Spelling Bee's tomorrow.
But, Lois, I'm ascared, there's no way I can compete against other kids.
This like trained a Beach Shpoople champion Fiorg Wanderplug get a game a shpoople.
Shpoople!
Don't be said, Paiter. That's why they call it shpoople.
God, we look like idiots.
He-hey, that's more like it. Where'd you get the threads?
We went to Barney's, I heared that's where all the famous people shop for skinny leg jeans.
These are the thightest penis-compressing and
sperm-killing and testicles-grippinest jeans I ever tried on.
Brian, Franck, meet Dakota and New Bedford.
- Hey, how is it hanging, Dakota? - What's up, New Bedford?
You look like rappers but you're not black so that's the perfect 'em out of danger.
God, hell. You guys get to know each other.
Looks like my doormate let another gazelle in there.
I'm sorry but we've been over this before. We don't serve your kind here.
You're gonna hear from my lawyer.
Yeah! You know, I would welcome that.
I would welcome the opportunity to hear from a lawyer that represents a gazelle.
What's his name?
Yeah, I don't have a lawyer.
And I'll tell you something about Dean Martin.
He was the only guy on the golf course who had a five iron with the cork on the end of it.
So, who wants to come back to hotel and take a wack at my genitals?
- Cool! - Awesome!
All right, we got a ball game.
Hang on, girls, I'll get you a couple of appletinies.
This is going great, Franck! This club and this closes
My god, there's nothing that could stop us.
Hey, party people, I'm ready to get 86
- Andy Dick! - Oh, no!
C'mon, let's get out of here.
- What the hell just happened? - Andy Dick happened.
As soon as that guy shows up anyplace, it gets a worse rapped than John Wilkes Booth.
Stupid hat, damn it.
I paid fifteen cents for this ticket.
No, he didn't.
God! Could he be anymore annoying?
Ah, hey, stop!
Tomme-e-e-e, ha-ha-ha.
Hey, here, you took that black chick home?
Hey, hey, you're welcome, ha-ha-ha.
[Quahog Civic Center] [District Spelling Bee]

Candy.
That's correct.
Our next contestant is Peter Griffin.
Peter, your word is tree.
Can you use it in a sentence, please?
There's a tree by the lake.
Huh-- Can you use it in a dirty sentence?
I like to bring transient hookers to the old oak-tree
where I asphyxiate myself at the same time I watch them having sex with each other.
T-R-E-E

Your word is-- lesbians.
Can you use it in the sentence?
The two lesbians are going shopping.
Can you use it in a dirty sentence?
The two lesbians are going shopping for double sided marade(?) leads.
Damn.
Wait! Can you use it in a labelist sentence?
Gillian Anderson and Helen Hunt are lesbians.
- L-E-S-B-I-A-N-S - Correct!
I did it, Lois. My god, I did it.
You sure did, Peter, I'm so proud of you.
Way to go, dad.
Yeah, you're a smart fella, dad.
And you're a fart smeller, Meg.
Let's go home.
[Pawtucket brewery]
Angela, I did it, I finished the third grade.
I'm ready for my promotion.
Griffin, you blew up a children's hospital, you're going to jail.
What?
What, you think, everyone just forgot about that?
There was an investigation, fingerprints, forensic reports.
Nineteen childred died, Peter.
And the FBI knows it was you.
Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty.
and sentences you to seven days in prison.
You'll be out next sunday at nine.
God! I can't believe we bought this ridiculous clothes for a club that didn't even last.
Hey, come on, we had a great seventy-two hour run and in this business that's all you can ask for.
Besides, I've already opened a new club that's even more exclusive than this one.
Really? Where is it?
Brian, it's so exclusive that it doesn't even have a location.
It's in here, human heart.
I think that's a beat we can all done, Stu.
Wow, I weirdly feel a lot better.
Hey, Brian, what do you say, we sing Stewie some real music?
Sounds good to me.
On the western side of Quahog
if you care to come along
there's a club that's so exclusive
that a line is ten miles long
Where the douchebags come to party
and to spend their fathers cash
just to take home slutty women
and then wake up with the rash
yeah, they wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up with a rash
Take me out to pLace tonight
where the ...(?) keep our tight

Title: Ocean's Three and a Half

Family Guy 7x07 Ocean's Three and a Half
www.FamilyGuyRussia.com
Timing: reaper Trascript: reaper
- Hey fellas, you all set for some paintball? - You bet!
God! Joe, finally! You watch paralyzed too?
Guys, I don't think I can make it today. It looks like Bonny
might go in to labor any minute so I think I should stick close to home.
It's your fault for knocking her up.
That's why I always use a con...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't even say that with a straight face.
Sorry, fellas. Have a good time.
Man, I am so sick of this. Joe is just gonna keep
bailing on us until that baby comes out of Bonny's butt.
Babies come out of the butt, right?
Yeah...
Well, we are gonna do something about it.
We are gonna figure out a way to induce labor
and make Bonny have that baby.
Yeah! The sooner that kid comes out the sooner we get Joe back.
Yeah. We're not complete without Joe.
You remember when he bailed on us for that trip to spa
we had to find another handicapped guy?
God, Seamus, I've... never seen you this naked.
Ahh, it's good to let the old midsection breathe.
What eh...
How the hell are you alive?
Hey Peter, how are you?
Never mind that, Bonny. I'm here to induce birth. Follow me.
Now I'm gonna put the TV-remote down by your feet.
And I'm gonna turn on "Two and a half men"
If your baby isn't totally braindead it'll come rushing out to change the channel.
And when he does I'll grab his hand and yank him out of there.
- Peter, I don't think... - Sh! It's starting.
Two and a half men was filmed in front of a live ostrich.
Boy, this stinks. It's friday night and I don't have a date.
Well then, let me get you a number from my little black book.
Guys! Bonny's going into labor.
We gotta get her to the hospital. Quick, Peter, get the car.
No way! I don't want pregnant mess in my backseat.
Oh, come on, you're the guy who soiled his pants while testdriving that sportscar.
I don't want it.
All right, mrs. Swanson, you're doing fine.
Hey Peter, don't you wanna watch this? It's a beautiful miracle of nature.
I can't look. I didn't look when Lois gave birth and I can't look now.
You can just... tell me what it looks like.
You ever see a horse blink his eye?
Ok mrs. Swanson, you're almost there. Push. Push!
Get out of there! GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WIFE YOU LITTLE BASTARD!!!
Ok. Here we go.
Hold on, the wheelchair is coming first.
And here's the baby...
Congratulations mrs. Swanson, it's a beautiful baby girl.
Ah, Bonny, I'm so happy for you.
Oh my god! She's dying!
WHAT?!
Oh, sorry. I was watching this Paula Poundstone comedy special.
Here's your baby.
She's beautiful.
And she's sweetheart.
She sure is, Joe.
It's hard to believe she's already 18.
Attention everyone. This is a twist tie, it comes with every loaf of bread.
When we are done selecting our piece of bread we use the tie to preserve...
Oh my God!
Who is that angel?
That's Susie Swanson.
You don't say...
What? Like you think you had a shot with her?
Ah, you're kidding. We'll go together better than Hannity and Colmes.
My problem with liberals, Allen, is that liberals hate America.
So and I don't know if that's true
You've just contradicted me. You hate America!
If I could just get a word in.
You hate America. You like the terrorists.
Well, I guess you're right again.
Bonny, we've got a problem.
- What's the matter, Joe? - I'll tell you while we doing a diaper change.
Here's the reality of the situation. I've got a hospital bill this morning.
- How bad is it? - It's 20 thousand dollars.
Oh my God! Where are we gonna get that kind of money?
I don't know but we gotta figure that out soon.
I know where, Joe. You'll think out something.
I gotta tell you. That being able to pay my child hospital bills somehow makes me feel that...
Less of a man.
Oh, honey, that's silly.
I'm gonna show you what a man you really are.
Now, let's get your penis on.
Joe? What the hell, you're working here?
I have to, Quagmire.
The baby's hospital bill drain dollar savings
so I've had no choice but to take this job
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Scuse me, I couldn't help over there and you got yourself some money issues.
Uh... Yeah, kinda.
Well, I might be able to help you. How much you need?
Look, I'm a police officer, I can't afford to get mixed with a lawn shark.
Hey, you should listen to this guy, Joe.
He's flipping a nickel and chewing on a toothpick.
Well, I... do really need the money.
And I don't have the credit for a bank loan.
Do it, Joe. Cause if you gonna work here any longer,
you're gonna feel smaller than my eye floaters.
Ah! There's one now.
I can never look at it dead on, it always trying to get away.
- Hey eye floater. - Hi.
Hey! Hey, where you're going?
Away from you, people.
- Well, maybe I'll look over here. - I'll go over here.
You've got an answer for everything, don't you?
Oh, Brian, come here.
Would you mind listen to this song I wrote for Susie Swanson and tell me what you think?
Ok.
Susie... you're a baby
That's... that's all I have so far.
That was horrible. It was bad as Beethoven near the end.
They gonna love that.
Well, I'm still gonna do a little work on it.
What's it called?
Susie.
Wow! A song named after a girl.
There're million of those already.
Name 20.
Rosanna, Roxana, Michelle, Allison, Sara
Angie, Brandy, Mendy, Gloria
Cecilia, Maggy, May, Jessica, Nancy
Barbara, Ann, Billie Jin, Leila, Lola
Polly, Helena, Jenny from the block.
Name 6 more.
Sherry, Lora, Wendy, Maria, Peggie Sue, Minnie the Moocher
Name 5 more.
Tracey, Jin, Jane, Marie Ann, Eleanor Rigby.
Go fuck yourself.
What am I gonna do, guys? I paid the hospital bill
but now I need $20k to pay the lawn shark.
I'm right back where I started.
Well, sounds like we need another lawn shark.
Don't worry, Joe. We're all gonna pitch in and help you raise that money.
Wow Peter, I got to say
this lemonade stand was really a good idea. It's selling really well.
That's because it has my secret ingridient in it.
Vodka!
You know what we should do?
You know what we should do?
We should just... We should just get on our bikes and just go.
Just go and start a business.
You know... I've never to... I've never told anyone this.
but you're so good at cursive.
I don't know Peter, we've been out here all day
and we haven't managed to interest a single woman in our massage parlour.
Wait a minute, here comes somebody.
Excuse me, stressed out lady.
May I interest you in a full release relaxation massage?
Oh yeah! Just what I need. To be rubbed down by big fatty
an old black guy, a crippled and a pervert.
Now we don't have any money and our feelings are hurt.
So, that's pretty much it, mr. Pewterschmidt
Joe's getting desperate and we haven't raised nearly enough.
Is there any way you could help us out?
Of course I could.
But it's funnier to me if I don't.
In about an hour I'm gonna piss away 20 grand.
What are you gonna bet on the Nicks?
It's... I'm sorry... I mean how often...
I mean... Oh, man, nobody think that's funny?
Oh my god, she's so hot.
Look at that, she can fit that full bottle in her mouth.
Allright, come on Stewie, you can write a song. How hard could it be.
You your G-code right here
It's like a cozy house where you live
that's where you start your journey
here I am in my house, nice and cozy
and then you poke your head out the door with the seacode(?)
everything looks ok out here
maybe I'll take a walk outside
to the decored
oh, walking around outside
look at all that stuff out here
and then we go to an ...(?)
getting a little cloudy out here
looking like we might have some weather
then we go to ...(?) oh, definetly goes some weather
things a little more complicated than they seen at first
and then we go back to my house
You sound like an unbelieveable douche.
then Brian comes in and I change up the tempo
Brian comes in and it changes the song
looking at me like he thinks I'm a douchebag
but he's gonna learn pretty fast that he's wrong
hey Brian, why are you bringing me down there?
why are you bringing me down? DON'T BRING ME DOWN!
Music and lyrics by Stewie Griffin.
Hey Swanson, the boss is getting impatient. He wants his money.
He says after we've done with you, you gonna be eaten...
Swanson TV... TV-di... wait, what did he said?
- What? - Wha-What did the boss said? He said something funny and now I drowe the blank, wha-wha-what it was?
Eh, you know what is was? You know what it was?
When we're done with him he's gonna be a Swanson TV-dinner.
That is pretty funny.
Look what they did to me. My legs are useless now.
And trust me, they'll be back.
Well, what are we gonna do?
You know what, boys? Desperate times call for desperate measures.
If that stingy old cat won't give us the money we need
I say we take it from him.
Guys, we are gonna plan a robbery.
Hey, hey. That's the guy.
That's the guy whose chin... looks like a b... balls.
All right. On a normal night in a Pewterschmidt mansion there might be as much as 6 million dollars in a vault alone.
But this Saturday is the Pewterschmidt annual "Bring all your cash and put it in our safe" party.
Considering the guest list there could be as much as 40 million.
But we only need 20 thousand.
All right, I'll be honest with you.
My father-in-law has treated me like crap
for almost 20 years and it's time for a little payback.
I tell you, he's treated me worse than that jerk Cristian Bale did.
I want you off the fucking set, you prick!
Sorry.
Don't just be sorry!
Think for one fucking second!
I dropped the pean(?) on Eminem and rolled over here.
I'm not gonna walk around and rip your fucking lights stand in a middle of a scene.
Those are the Christmas lights, I put them up to make everyone happy.
Then why the fuck are walking right through?
Ah, ta-da-ta-da, like this in the back room. What the fuck it is with you?
Well, you are gonna owe a fortune to a swearjack(?).
You got ... here. Hey, it's fucking distracting!
Having somebody walking up behind bries(?) in the scene.
Give me your fucking answer!
I don't get it.
What don't you get about it?
I don't get why we need another terminator. I just... I don't get it.
And by the way, sorry, I ate that last piece of pie you were saving for yourself.
Ah! Good for you! And how was it?
It was good.
I hope it was fucking good because it's useless now, isn't it?
Wa... It's nourishing me, so it's useful.
... sake man, you're amateur.
I don't know that word.
Stay off the fucking set man.
Right, let's go again.
Can we just take a minute?
Let's not take a fucking minute, let's go again!
I'm gonna go pee and I wanna walk around
some more and I walla scenes going (?).
You're unbelieveable, man.
I just don't understand...
You don't fucking understand what it's like working with actors. That's what that is.
I... I don't think that's what that...
That's what that is, man, I'm telling you.
My family is coming to town, do you mind pretending that I'm the director.
(?)
Oh, there's my laptop.
Do you mind, I wanna check my e-mail.
Go away! I'm editing this music video, I'm making for Susie.
Oh, really? Music video?
Working on a little video there?
Little uh... Little music video?
Little compilation of visual images to go with the song?
Little 4-minute movie that tells the story of...
Yeah, that only works when I do it.
There. All done. All right, Brian, get ready to feel.
Look into your heart - you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am - take my life
I would give it all - I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you
There's no love - like your love
And no other - could give more love
There's nowhere - unless you're there
All the time - all the way
- I'm not following the story arc here. - Shut up!
Look into your heart, babe
Oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you - yeah I'd die for you
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you
Don't worry, Brian, those goose bumps will go away in about 20 minutes.
Bill, how are you? Barb, come over here and say hi to Bill Gates.
Hello, mr. Gates.
Hi, mrs. Pewterschmidt. Well, this is a great little party you guys are throwing.
Hey Bill, will you help me programming my Zune?
Oh, wait, I have an iPod like the rest of the world.
Why you?
All right, Joe, we're here.
All right, Peter, Quagmire, start the diversion.
Cleveland, find that door.
- Check. - Check.
Hey fellas, knock off all that high society crap and play some of this.
One. Two. Three. Four.
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out
All right, Cleveland, you're all clear to enter the vault.
Copy that.
Uh oh, it's a combination lock.
Looks like I'm just gonna cut through it.
Good thing I brought Reese Witherspoon's cheen.
Brian, do you know where Peter is?
Yeah, he and the guys went to rob your dad.
I believe you.
I'm in.
Holy crap, there's another door.
What are we gonna do?
Welcome to the vault. Voice identification, please.
Uh oh.
It's me, Carter, I want my money.
Voice print verified.
How the hell did you do that?
I can do you guys too.
- Hey everybody. - Oh, hey Peter.
- No, it's still me. - Ah.
Welcome to the inner vault. Penile identification required.
Let me handle this.
That's amazing! How the hell did you match it?
Oh, I didn't match the shape, I just stuck in and broke it.
Final checkpoint. Answer this question.
What is the most unattractive male first name in the English language?
Kif.
Wow! Look at this place.
All right boys, pack up the do(?) and get out of there.
Joe, stop!
Lois, what are you doing here?
I'm here to try to talk some sense into you.
Do you really wanna go through with this?
I have to, Lois, for my family.
I don't know where else to get 20 thousand dollars.
But you know, dad will find out
he'll put his best people on a job and believe me he'll catch you.
That's the risk I'm willing to take.
But think about your beautiful little girl.
You can't wach her grow up from jail.
You'll miss running after her as she learns to walk...
I... I mean... I mean riding bikes with her as she...
I mean dancing at the wedding...
Look, my point is you know that you doing this wrong
and you know how to make it right.
Uh... Guys... Put the money back and get out of there.
What? Are you out of your mind?
Tell 'em, Megatron.
DO AS I COMMAND!
Ok, ok, jeez.
So, how'd Susie like your video?
I don't care about her anymore.
I'm in love with Brian Adams.
Peter, I want you to promise me, you'll never do anything that stupid again.
Lois, after what you did for Joe, I promise you everything.
How the hell did you get your dad to give that 20 grand?
I told him it was for me.
I said I wanted to hire a divorce lawyer.
You're... you joking about that, right?
Lois?
You're joking, right?
Lois?!

Now remember, Peter, don't touch this money until you get to the grocery store.
Then buy one can of beans and come straight home.
Do you understand?
Lois, I'm the guy you can trust with the task.
I'm the one who almost conquered the Dragon's Lair.
DRAGON'S LAIR
Peter, where have you been?
You left for the market six hours ago. Did you get the beans?
Lois, I've got something better!
You know how you always wanted a real diamond engagement ring?
Oh! Oh my god!
That's right! I bought a horse.
You bought a horse?
Why the h... I didn't even give you that much money.
That's what I thought, Lois.
Sold! To the gentleman from Quahog, Rhode Island.
Congratulations, sir! What brings you down to Louisville?
I don't know!
Peter, there's something off about that horse.
You have an eye for animals, Lois.
This horse is brain-damaged, that's why I got it so cheap.
Peter, I don't think it's wise to have a brain-damaged horse as a house pet.
Shut up!
You don't know nothing.
But anything.
Whatever Peter. Fine. Keep the horse.
Good. This family works much better when we're unified.
You'll see, this horse will be a fine addition to our family.
You know what, I don't want him to feel selfconcious. Everybody pee.
- Pee no... - Everybody pee.
NOW
We're an unusual family.
Peter. The horse is here.
Oh yeah.
It's so creepy the way it just stares like that.
Why isn't it do something?
Uh... What is it?
Brian... Is Paul Sorvino standing behind me?
Hey, you wanna sugar cube, horsy?
Oh, oh god, Brian don't!
What made you come around, Lois?
I love you so much.
I love you so much, Lois.
Mmm... I love you too, Peter.
Peter, take Maple Drive, otherwise we won't make the movie on time.
All right.
- Uh oh. - What?
Uh... The horse is right behind the car.
Peter, this thing is just creepy.
Hey! Scare! Scare!
Cmon you! We're go... We're going to see a movie.
All right, I'm gonna try something else.
No, no, no, no, no, nooo...
Oh, that's got all my stink of the day in it.
That's nasty.
Peter, why are there so many bottles of milk in the refrigerator?
Oh, thanks for reminding me.
Everyone, some of the milk in the fridge is not milk
it's horse sperm.
I'm a horse breeder now.
Peter, no one's gonna want to breed with that horse.
After tomorrow they will.
I'm gonna enter him into the Quahog derby and he's gonna win.
I just know it. I got a sixth sense about these things.
Remember when I predicted the ending to the wild hogs?
This movie is gonna suck.
[Today: Quahod derby. Tomorrow: Terrence Trent D'Erby]
Hey there, little fella.
I'm 48.
This whole place is a giant mindfuck.
Boy, I've never been in the owners box.
We are gonna get a great view of the track from up here.
This is gonna be a great race.
What are you doing? Get down there.
Where's your midget?
Sorry boss, had to pee.
Come on, you.
Guess, he's got a small bladder.
Little tiny guy, gotta go all the time.
Even though he's got a race, he couldn't hold it.
And they're off!
Go, horsy, go!
God, it even runs like it messed up in the head.
Is there reason all the horses are named after canceled Fox shows?
Kitchen Confidential is in the lead
followed by The Wedding Bells
followed by The Happy Hour
followed by The War at Home
followed by Drive
followed by The Winner
followed by Life on a Stick
followed by The Loop
followed by Head Cases
followed by Standoff
followed by Vanished
followed by Free Ride
followed by Method & Red
followed by Tru Calling
followed by Quintuplets
followed by Stacked
followed by Justice
followed by North Shore
followed by Back to You
And bringing up the rear but somehow still in the race is 'Til Death.
You named your horse 'Til Death?
You know why?
'Cause I'm gonna take this horse and shove it down America's throat.
What's this?
It looks like 'Till Death has taken a right turn and is heading into the stand.
Dear god! I could describe the horror I'm witnessing
but it is so unfathomable ugly and heartrending that I cannot bring myself to do so.
Although I do posess the necessary descriptive powers.
Oh... Well at least the horse ran past the class of visiting deaf secondgraders.
Oh no! Dear god, it's going back.
I know you can't hear any screams
but I assure you they're signing frantically
just as fast as their little fingers can shape
the complicated phonemes necessary to convey dread and terror.
Wait a sec. Hold a phone.
He's going back towards the track.
Fellas, this race ain't over yet.
My baby's dead!
It's over.
One hundred thousand dollars worth a damage.
All thanks to that stupid horse of yours.
Look, can we not talk about the horse, please? It's gone.
It suffered a fatal heart attack from the exitement when I disposed of it properly.
Oh boy. I miss the old days when it was just a flaming bag of poop and a hurtful note.
I have no idea how the hell we're gonna pay for this, Peter.
Well, I just have to get a second job or something.
Hand me the classifieds.
Hey Lois, look at this. Subject wanted for medical...
- what's that? - Experiments.
Ex...paragus.
Experiments.
Ex...pe-ri-ments.
Right.
And it says they'll pay handsomely.
This is perfect. Now I want to take off that job as Matt Damon's neck.
Hey, Matt.
Matt.
Hey, is this another one of those movies
where you're an educated Boston street tough?
I don't have to take that crap from you, neck.
Ah, you have to, my friend.
I'm your neck.
What're you gonna do? Chop me? You'll die.
You'll die if you do that.
Can somebody from wardrobe bring me a scarf?
Oh, I'm still gonna... I'll just talk louder.
Ben Affleck married Jennifer Gardner
but you're married a bartender with a kid.
These are facts.
So what have I got to do, doc?
You don't have to do anything mr. Griffin.
We're isolating and studying the effects of various types of genes.
We're just going to give you a series of experimental injections and record the results.
What's this one?
We call this the squirrel gene.
Its effects will become apparent shortly.
OK. What's next?
This is the Seth Rogen gene.
It will give you the appearance of being funny even though you haven't done anything funny.
Hey, doc, is it gonna be much longer?
I gotta get some beers with the fellas before I go on this date.
How charming and chubby. I'm routing (?) for you.
All right, mr. Griffin, at this time we're going to inject
you with what we believe we've isolatet as...
the Gay gene.
I don't understand.
Well, if we're correct, we'll have successfuly
proven that homosexuality is genetic.
And not the matter of choice or environment.
Are you crazy?
I don't wanna take a chance on being gay.
We'll give you a hundred and twenty five dollars.
All right, I'll do it.
Boy, you are more persuasive than James Bond.
Now. Time for some unfinished business.
- No, James. - Yes!
- No, James! - Yes! You're going to have sex with me.
No, James, I don't want to.
Yes, you do.
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do!
- No, I don't! - Yes, you do!
Okay, yes.
See that? 50 Nos and a yes means yes.
Hi.
So how the medical experiments go?
So good, Lois, so good.
I'm gonna squeeze right in here if my size will let me.
Peter, what exactly did they inject you with?
Ah, all sorts of things
hepatitis vaccine, a couple of steroids
the gay gene, calcium, a vitamine b extract.
What did you just say?
The gay gene.
I assume that's the one you meant even though it wasn't literally the last
thing I've said when you said "What did you just say?"
Clearly it was the most unusual.
Yes! That's the one I meant.
Peter... are you... gay?
Guil-tyyyyyy...
Did anybody see that absolutely fabulous piece on Fiji in yesterday's travel section?
I wish I was Beyonce.
Peter, I think maybe you should go back and have that doctor undo whatever he did.
Oh, my muffins are ready.
You made muffins?
Well, it wasn't the muffin fairy.
Or was it?
Go ahead, try it.
Peter...
Try it.
Dad, I think mom's right. Maybe you should go back to that doctor.
Well now. Wait a minute, Meg.
Let's not be too hasty. These are delicious.
What?
I've said homosexuality is wrong.
Are you... Are you being serious right now?
Just keep it in the bedroom, you know.
I mean, I'm not holding your face with my heterosexuality.
Uh... No, you are not.
Damn it!
Knock-knock.
What's the problem, champ?
Why is math so hard?
Way you know it doesn't have to be.
One trick I used to use is turn the things into a word problem.
For example
If there are three glory holes in the bathroom at the club and
28 guys at the circut party
How many rotations of guys will it take before everybody's had a turn?
I don't know.
Nine, with the remainder of Brent.
Oh...
Guys, Brent can't fit in the glory hole, and that's why we all like Brent.
We now return to
That black guy must be doing well because everything he owns is white.
Hey, how're you doing?
Wow! He must be doing well.
Well, here's the new nighty you've picked up for me.
What do you think?
I think I'm jelous of miss "Eats anything she wants
and still fits into size 4" Oh, I could scratch your eyes out. Meow.
You know, Peter, with all the shopping and cooking
and decorating. I have to say
I'm really liking the new you an awful lot.
An AWFUL lot.
Wha... What are you... What are you doing?
I'm fooling around.
C'mon, sweety, let's have some fun.
Lois! I'm gay!
You... Wait a minute, you mean...
We can't have sex?
Uh! Nooo!
Peter, we're married.
Tony Randall was married, Lois
Rock Hudson was married
Ronald Reagan was married.
Mr. President, did you reach a missile pact?
Well, you could say that.
There was a missile and something definitely got pact.
Just tell me, doctor, is there anything you can do to remove this gene?
Well, mrs. Griffin, it doesn't really work that way.
We just have to wait for the effects to wear off.
Well, how long will that take?
A week, a month, a year...
525600 minutes?
Oh! Rent! Rent! Rent!
For all we know, he could be this way for the rest of his life.
I don't see what's the big deal is. I like myself this way.
It's a very big deal. You'll be treated differently.
Just like my uncle Ray with the really high up anus.
I'll be out in a minute.
So, dad's gonna be gay forever?
Possibly, Meg.
So we're all just gonna have to get used to this
and lend to accept your father for who he is now.
Oh, great plan, Lois. Hey, here's a merry idea
ever read The Bible? Leviticus 18:22.
Stewie, you judgementaly quoting Bible versus and you don't even know how to read.
Welcome to America, Brian.
Hi, everybody. This is Scott.
Aw... Who's Scott?
My solemate, Lois. I'm here, I'm queer, but don't get used to it 'cause I'm leaving you.
What?!
I'm sorry, Lois. I can't deny who I am any longer.
I am Peter Griffin, homosexual.
And that's how I gonna live my life.
Chris, you're the man of the house now.
Take the lessons I've thought you and be the best leader of this household you can.
I will, dad!
Oh god, I miss Peter so much.
Gay or not, I just wish he was still here.
I miss dad too, mom. But we'll manage it somehow.
We're still a family, right?
Yeah! I mean we're thighter than asian family.
You doctor yet?
No, dad, I'm 12.
Talk to me when you're doctor.
I am so gay for you, Scott.
I'm so gay for you, Peter.
Penis for your thoughts.
I just... You complete me, you know that?
You just make me want to be a gayer man.
Oh, come here.
And you don't miss your wife at all?
Ah, sure I do, but this is a whole new chapter of my life, Scott.
And that chapter is all about you.
Oh, Peter, let's snuggle on the couch and watch Lifetime.
We now return to Meredith Baxter in
Raped by a Clown.
It was awful, he made me do things
awful things.
What kind of things?
I don't even talk about it.
So, you sure you don't need any house repairs, mrs. Griffin?
No, thanks, Rick. Ever since Peter left
our house hasn't been getting destroyed by a shenenigans on a weekly basis.
God, I feel so bad for Lois. She really misses Peter.
I just wish there were something we could do.
Well there is Brian. I looked into it.
Straight Camp.
Straight Camp?
Yeah, it's where gays are gonna get cured.
This is dated last year.
Oh yeah. I just... I just had it lying around.
I don't know. Goes against everything I believe in.
But at this point I'm willing to try anything.
I am sixteen going on seventeen 
I know that I'm naive
Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet And willingly I
Oh, for the love of penis.
[Straight Camp]
What the... Where am I?
This is Straight Camp, Peter. I'm sorry but I'm doing it for Lois.
By the time you get out of here you're gonna be back to your old self again.
Welcome to Straight Camp, everyone.
You're all here because you've made a choice to renounce your evil sinful ways
and redeem yourself in the eyes of your lord and saviour Jesus Christ
who hates many people but none more than homosexuals.
And through our carefully structured programm you will succeed.
All right, men, this is Harry the homosexual.
Say hi to everyone, Harry.
Hi, fellas.
I sure love being gay.
Harry's choice of lifestyle is wrong.
So we're gonna beat him up for it.
Now, take these baseball bats and get to it.
All right, good so far.
No, no, no, don't use the bats like that.
No, no, don't use them like that either.
All right. Look. Just put them down and use your fists.
No, no, no, not like that.
All right. This next exercise will train you to talk like a straight man.
Peter, we'll start with you. Repeat every word I say exactly as I say it.
Tonight me and my friends Poly and Matty are going out to drink a ton of beers.
Tonight my friends and I are going out but
we're not drinking because those are empty calories.
Then we'll play full contact football in the
park with no pads or helmets.
Then we're gathering at Allen and Omars for
bad movie night
Then its straight to the bars to find
loose women to have sex with.
Then its straight to the gym for three hours of
crunches and extended eye contact with strangers.
Peter!
Oh, don't get me that look, Tony.
That's exactly what you said. I said it right back to you.
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry about you, people
but I didn't know where else to go.
I haven't seen Peter in two days
and I just thought he might be here.
What? Oh my god, Peter's missing?
Hey, hang on, hang on, hang on
before anyone gets too worked up.
I know where Peter is.
- Where? - I put him into Straight Camp.
You what?
You bastard!
Brian, why did you do that?
Well, its just... You seem so unhappy and I just...
wanted to help you get your husband back.
Who knows, by now Peter could be completely heterosexual again.
Throw out your hands!! Stick out your tush!!
Hands on your hips Give them a push!!
You'll be surprised You're doing the French Mistake!!
VOILA!!
STOP!
Lois? What are you doing here?
I'm here to get you out of this place, Peter.
I'm taking you back to Scott.
Really? You're not still upset about my leaving?
Peter, there's nothing I'd want more than have you back
but your place is in Scott now.
I mean a person sexual identity
is no more a choice than the color of his skin.
This is who you are, I can't change you.
And it would be wrong for me to try.
Ah, Lois, you've made me happier than a
pig among guinea pigs.
All right, I think we all on agreement. I'm in charge here.
Hi, Peter.
Hi, Scott!
Guess what? I have a welcome home surprise for you.
Ah, dish, dish, dish.
Remember how you told me?
Your ultimate fantasy was to have in eleven way.
Oh my god, yes I do. And you so did not even.
Oh, but I did. Yoohoo, guys.
Ah, here's my notes about the gay gene.
Huh. It wears off after two and a half weeks.
Oh great, now I can't find mrs. Griffins number.
Okay. Everybody ready?
Oh god, I feel like I'm kid in the candy store
who's having sex with a bunch of gay guys.
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?
Holy crap!
These are mine.
So, we're just like never gonna talk about this again?
That's right, sweety.
Well, I'm just happy to have your father home again.
Yeah, and thank god everything's back to normal.
Take back your fucking horse!

OK, Peter, I'm off to my book club.
You'll babysit Stewie?
Only if I can have a plastical.
Only if you say it right.
Pa... psycal.
Good! And you gotta be responsible tonight.
I don't want the repeat of the last time
I left you alone with one of our children.
It's just so horrible.
I'm sorry, Lois.
I thought if I shock him enough it'd stop crying.
I was kinda right.
Yeah, I'm babysitting for Stewie.
I babysit now, 'cause I'm grown up.
I'm so getting hair down there.
Anyway, you guys should totally come over.
What? You're already here? No way!
OK, Quagmire's turn. Truth or Dare?
Uh... I pick dare... No, no, no, truth, truth!
OK, truth. Do you have AIDS?
Ah... C'mon, we're all just trying to have a good time.
OK, Cleveland, your turn. Truth or Dare?
Um... Dare!
OK. I dare you to make out with Joe for 15 seconds.
- What? - No way! Uh! Uh!
You got to, it's a dare.
- That's the game. - That's the game.
OK. What's the hell, I'm an openminded person.
So am I. No big deal.
Just my body.
Oh my god! They gonna do it! Oh, I gotta take a picture.
[Peter and Quagmire shouting]
Hey! Keep it down.
It's just two guys making out, relax.
Stewie, go to bed.
What am I expected to put myself to bed?
Is no one taking care of me?
Duh, he's a worse dad than a rich New York City investment banker.
Hi, daddy! At school today they pick one kid...
Melly, it's in here again.
Me sorry, mister sir.
Get out the room, how dare you to bother your father.
Him unhappy. Him had doing in first place.
Now come on, I'll let you rub some lotion on me elbows.
We now return to Robert Mitchum in
Out of shape inshape guy from the 50's.
Gambling is illegal in this town.
Says who?
Says me. You got a problem with that?
I'm... Not really sure.
Kinda waiting for you to exhale.
Actually yeah, I do have a problem with that.
Oh, come on. Stupid satellite TV.
Maybe I have to fix the dish.
Uh oh.
Oh no! Oh no!
Hehey, hey. Help. Help!
Hey! Hey, Brian! Brian!
What the hell?
Call the fire brigade! Get a ladder! Get me down!
What are you doing up there?
Counting the stars in the Orion's penis!
What do you think I'm doing up here, I'm stuck!
How did you get on the roof?
What am I doing an interview? Shut up and get a ladder or something!
Actually yeah. Maybe we are doing an interview.
So, Stewie, tell us about that new project you have coming up.
What are you talking about? Get me down, you douche.
No. First you tell me about that new project.
Oh, you're so dead.
Is that the title of your new film?
Uh... I've been working on a new movie and it's really great. Toss me a rope!
No, that's not good enough. I want details.
Grr... I'm gonna slit your throat while you sleep.
Am... Well... When you working with Jack Black...
Uh... You just got to keep up, you know.
I mean he's doing his thing and you got to...
You got to match his energy level.
Without looking like you trying to warm up him
'cause, you know, that's the game you just not gonna win.
What was it like having a privilege
of performing the words of Oscar winnier Diablo Cody?
She's an overpriced cool girl who's got lucky once.
Uh... That doesn't sound like an interview answer.
Say something nice about Diablo Cody.
I... envy the tattoo artist who had that
huge canvas of arm fat to work with.
Wonderful. Wonderful. Hey, listen, could you hang with us through the break?
What?
We'll be right back with Stewie's co-star Robin Williams.
No! No, I hate Robin Will... Where you going?
Stewie!
What?
I have to tell you about the future.
What?
I have to tell you 'bout the future.
On the night, I go back...
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, hang on, Michael.
I have to tell you about your future.
Peter, Stewie's on the roof.
Ah, Nick Jonas is so cute.
Hey, Peter.
Yeah?
PILLOW FIGHT!
Ah, you bastard.
Oh my god! Sorry, Lois.
Peter! What is our infant son doing up on the roof?
There's a racoon up here.
Yikes! Looks like I need a distraction.
Ladies and gentlemen, mr. Conway Twitty.
Twitty Conway - I See The Want In Your Eyes
Terrific! Terrific!
So, Lois, you still pissed at me about Stewie being on the roof?
Yes, Peter, I am.
Oh, for crying out loud. If Conway Twitty isn't enough
to lighten you up, what more is it gonna take?
A minotaur with Sean Connery's head?
Is this 31 Spooner st...
Get out of here. Just get the hell out of here.
Look, Lois, what do you say we just bury the hatchet, huh?
We'll stay in tonight, pop some popcorn and watch Jimmy Camel try.
No, thank you, Peter.
And even if wanted to, the TV is out.
There must be something wrong with the dish.
It's all right, it's all right. I'll fix the dish.
Where's my screwdriver.
Ho-ly crap!
You are not gonna believe what I just found.
The yellow piece of paper?
A raffle ticket, Brian.
But not just any raffle ticket.
I won this in 1989 from a Honey Nut Cheerios sweepstakes
and I totally forgot to cash it in.
It's one free round of golf with famous celebrity.
Woow. Who's the celebrity?
I'll give you a hint. Famous football player.
Had a bit part in Roots. Couple of great scenes in The Towering Inferno.
Wait a minute...
Chuck Connors? He was the basketball player and he was in Roots.
Yeah, he wasn't in The Towering Inferno, you dumb beaver.
What? I diidn't say nothing.
Dad, who is it?
O.J. Simpson.
Who's that?
O.J. Simpson on Spooner street.
Now, that's the story I can sink my teeth into.
Stick around.
Peter, why in the world would you want to play golf with O.J. Simpson?
Why not, Lois. He's The Juice, one of greatest football players ever.
Peter, he murdered two people.
What?
He brutally killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.
O.J. Simpson?
Yes!
Was this in the news?
Yes, Peter, it was all over the news.
Wait a minute, if he killed two people, how come he's not in jail?
He was acquitted.
Aw... Here you go, everything's fine.
Well, Peter, it's generally believed that the jury made a mistake.
You're saying all those guys in their powdered wigs and
pilgrim hats and their big gross wives were wrong?
Man, they have to be stupider than you are
when you fart yourself a wake.
Hello? What... Who's here? What's going on?
Whatever's happening here
just knock it off.
So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing one free round of golf
tomorrow with the one and only O.J. Simpson.
What? Peter, you can't play golf with O.J. Simpson. He's a murderer.
Oh, you sound just like Lois. No, no, Joe, I don't believe you.
Oh yeah? Well say that after the soul-searching walk
around the town to Dust in the Wind.
Kansas - Dust In The Wind
Oh my god, Joe, you right.
O.J. Simpson is a murderer.
What am I gonna do, I'm playing golf with him tomorrow.
Well, now wait a minute, Peter.
This may be an unpresented opportunity
Maybe you could wear a wire.
Get O.J. to confess and we could tape the whole thing.
Wow, imagine it. Peter Griffin - the guy who took down O.J.
Marsha Clark sure couldn't do it, you dumb beaver.
Hey! I wasn't even there.
I was building a canadian damb at the time.
Did you know that beavers affect ... more than any other animal?
Except men.
He was in our house earlier.
Now remember, Peter, we will be right here in the van if anything goes wrong.
Just try to get O.J. talking about the murders.
Do you think he'd be offended if I ask him to sign this basket ball?
Yeah, I think he'd be very offended.
All right, Joe, can you hear me?
Loud and clear, Peter.
Hi, are you Peter Griffin?
That's my name, don't put a knife in it.
Nice to meet you, c'mon, let's t. off.
Damn it. Would you look at these golf shoes, they're all scuffed up.
My wife were supposed to polish 'em but clearly she forgot.
Man, sometimes I just feel like I could just stab her repeatedly.
White women, huh?
Jewish waitress too.
I got this jewish waiter one time. He was awful, didn't tip him.
You eh... You've doing something bad to a jewish waiter?
What's up, Peter? I'm sorry, I was focusing on my drive.
You're doing great, Peter. Just don't let him intimidate you.
Guys, guys, someone's getting frogged in the clubhouse.
Quagmire!
She sounds fat.
Hey, you know what I like to do sometimes, Juice?
I like to just confess things I've done to people.
You know, just clean my ... Makes me feel a whole lot better.
Anything you'd like to confess?
No. Not really.
Peter, we're not really hearing him very well. Can you get closer?
Um... Are you sure O.J.?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to confess
to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman?
What?
What the hell is that?
You wearing a wire!
I am so murdered.
Peter, I'm hurt. How could you decieve me like this?
Oh god, O.J. please, don't kill me.
Wait a minute, is this about that whole business back in 1994?
Well, yeah.
Down it. That's been chasing me for 13 years.
And here I was looking forward to a nice day of golf
away from all those people who have demonized me
and made me out some kind of bogeyman.
Even though I was found innocent by jury of my PS.
But what about the civil trial?
Believe me, Peter, there was nothing civil about it.
Well, that makes up for one murder.
The one thing I'm guilty of is a few bad movies.
And that makes up for the other murder. I am sold.
You are so witty and charming.
That's nice of you to say, Peter.
It's been so long since I had a friend.
You poor fella.
Gosh, there's no way you could have killed anybody.
Not without sad eyes, I'm gonna make sure everything is gonna be all right.
Hey everybody, look who I brought home.
Ten thousand rushing yards, six pro-balls
two arrests and no convictions. All it's O.J. Simpson.
Hi, Griffins.
- Oh my god! - What the...
I just think you're terrific
O.J. this is my family. Family, O.J.
It's nice to meet you all.
Hey, Peter, you mind if I use your restroom?
No, it's upstairs and to the left.
Peter, are you out of your mind
bringing O.J. Simpson in our home?
Look, don't make that face at me, Lois.
O.J. is innocent, all right?
Peter, we know he did it.
Oh, you were there? I didn't realized that.
Oh, and you didn't do anything to stop it?
Oh, accessory to murder!
Why are you so quick to defend this guy?
Because he was a childhood hero, Brian.
Yes, he have a few marital problems but I used to look up to him.
That's it, isn't it? You idolized O.J. Simpson
as a boy and you just can't accept the fact
that he's not who you thought he was.
Right, enough with yepperty yep, O.J. is gonna stay
here with us in Quahog untill I can help him get his life back on track.
Hi, Lois.
Hello, O.J.
Anything I can do to help make dinner?
Um... Sure, you can take the lasagne out of the oven.
You got it.
Oh, wouldn't you know it, it won't fit.
Well, it's all right, how hard could it be.
Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry.
Uh, it's all right, O.J. Le-let me get something to clean that up.
OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!
Brian, what's the matter?
Oh, you're alive!
Yeah, we just had a little pasta spill.
Oh, thank god!
It's OK, Brian.
It's not the first accident we've had in this house.
OK, one...
two... Oh-oh, hang on, hang on, Brian. Stop the wheel, stop the wheel.
I BM'd.
Hey, Juice! Is it all right if I call you Juice? Great!
Listen, I was wondering if you could give me a little advise
on how to murder a woman and get away with it.
Ah, cool, look an that.
Hey, Chris, go long.
Touchdown!
Good grief.
What are you doing, O.J.?
Well, I've got no money left to pay my off civil suit debt.
So I'm making a god's eye to send to Fred Goldman.
It's kinda nice, right?
Better than nothing.
He's got money to buy tongue depressors and
yarn but not enough to pay us back?
You know how much mustache creme I could have bought?
I don't like the mustache, Fred.
Nobody likes the mustache.
That's why we lost the trial.
That's not true!
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
And I'm Diane Simmons.
Our top story tonight
Quahog, Rhode Island known for quaint neighborhoods
white sandy beaches and harboring bloodthirsty murderers?
That's right, Tom. Former murderer O.J. Simpson has moved to Quahog.
We don't have footage of the murder itself
but we can show you what's happened
thanks to this reanactment by the Quahog Opera Company.
I love you, Nicole
but I must confess
to some trepidation
for I am a lonely waiter
who loves a loss of a estation (?)
opera-style song
Well, it looks like this is one more town
the medias run me out of.
Now wait a second, Juice. You can't let them tell you how to live your life.
You've been running for too long.
I say you let people get to know you the way I have.
You really think that's possible, Peter?
Of course it is. We'll even throw a big party
and invite everybody in town and I promise, they'll accept you.
Peter, I really appreciate this but...
are you sure people are ready?
Absolutely O.J.
This party will get you a chance to get to know everybody
and give them a chance to know a real O.J. Simpson.
Peter, do you really expect anyone to show up?
Sure I do. Look, here comes a bunch of people.
Wow! What a turnout.
Uh, Peter, that's not a group of enthusiastic party guests
That's an angry mob.
We don't want you in our town, Simpson.
We don't love you like we did in 1993.
Doh!
And that's for you O.J.
We don't want you here either.
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Anyone who wants a piece of O.J. has to get by me.
No, Peter. This is my fight and I'll be the one to fight it.
Look at you all. Look what you're doing.
Why you no better than what you made me ought to be.
Sure I made some mistakes in my life.
I forget to take the trash out somedays.
I've left the toothpaste cap on the bathroom counter.
I've taped football games without the
expressed written consent of the NFL.
I guess what I'm saying is
I'm not perfect.
The only difference is I have the courage to admit it.
Does anyone else has the courage?
If so, why don't you just come on up here and join me?
He's right, I'm not perfect.
I suppose, I'm not either.
Yeah, I guess none of us are perfect.
Boy, do I feel like a jerk.
Me too.
I think we owe you an apology, O.J.
You see, none of us are perfect.
Oh, I guess he did do it.



Title: FOX Y Lady

Check it out guys. New driver's license.
What's wrong with your picture?
Well, see, I got drunk and then got my picture taken.
So that way, when I get pulled over for drunk driving I'll look the same as on my license.
Y'know, and then the copper, copper'll say "Oh, you're fine, you're not drunk.
This is you normal, I can tell by the picture."
I wish I thought of that.
I just got my new license a month ago.
What's with the big grin?
Oh, I'd just gotten a new tube of Aquafresh and I was feeling cocky.
Hey, let's see yours, Quagmire.
Hey, wait a second. You were born in 1948?
Uuh....yeah.
You're 61 years old?
Ah, yes sir.
What's your secret?
Uh...carrots. Sometimes I grind 'em up into juice, or just eat 'em raw.
Or insert them anally. Long as I get 'em into my body somehow.
Jigga-jigga.
And now back to the FOX News Report with Rhonda Latimer.
Oh, God. That new FOX news reporter is so freakin' hot.
Good evening. I'm Rhonda Latimer for FOX News. Here are tonight's top stories.
Oh, she's just so smokin' hot.
God, I would do things to her that....
...she would probably laugh at.
You bitch!!
Turn to the FOX News. It's time for Rhonda Latimer.
And we also want to remind you that FOX News switches to high definition starting Monday.
Ah, crap! Does this mean gotta get a new TV?
- Looks that way. - Great, I need another expense like I need a hole in the head.
And I don't need that.
I'm tellin' you this thing has turned out to be nothing but a burden.
Oh, my God! Peter, when did you get that?
Oh, a few of the fellows at work talked me into it.
Said it was something I might need.
Wha...? It's horrible.
The worst thing is, I found out I got it on the gay side.
- Hey, are you coming out tonight?
I'm not gay. They put the hole in the wrong side.
All right family. The wait is over.
I give you...... High Def television.
Oooh! Can I have the box?
Look at me. I'm an Iraq war vet in 10 years.
Naah! We're gonna take good care of them.
Wow! Look at that HD picture.
Yeah, it's so clear you can even see Ellen DeGeneris' breath.
Well, my guest today is, uh, Seth Rogan.
Who's got a new movie out.
Now, now Seth. This movie is hot.
It's just hot......hot......hot.
How's it feel to have the hottest film in Hollywood?
What the #%*$ ???
And now the real reason to have an HD TV.
And now the FOX News 6 o'clock report with Rhonda Latimer.
In High Definition.
Good evening everyone and I hope you're as thrilled about the new format change as I am.
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh.
A-a-a-a-a-a!
I'll get all of the A's out of my body.
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
We interrupt this report to inform you Rhonda Latimer has been relocated to Guantanamo Bay.
Coming up, the new format that makes HD obsolete.
Son of a bitch!
Mom, do you ever feel.... not so fresh down there?
No. There must be something wrong with you.
- Really? - Yeah.
I've never had that problem and I don't know any woman who has.
Hey, look at this. FOX News is looking for a replacement for Rhonda Latimer.
Hey, mom, you should try out.
I mean, you majored in journalism and you've never done anything with it.
Well, I did write for my college newspaper.
Yeah, didn't you do an interview with that fast talking FedEx guy?
Yeah, I ended up dating him for 3 months.
Thats a beautiful shade of lipstick. I bet you enjoy the music of Men at Work.
You're incredibly foxy. Take off your shirt. Take off your pants.
Wow, what a body, that feels good, I'll give you a call. You'd better get tested.
Yeah, mom, you should be a reporter.
Well, I mean I guess there's no harm in trying out.
Hey, Lois. A little less yackity-yak, little more cuttin' up my banana.
What am I supposed to do? Stick the whole thing in my mouth?
I mean .... Oh...... hello.
Lois, you can't possibly be considering working for FOX News.
Well, why not?
Why not? Because they're evil and they distort the truth.
And they do the bidding of the Republican party.
I mean ... what other reasons do you need?
Don't listen to Brian, Lois. You'd be great on camera.
Like I was, when I played that dead body on Law and Order.
Well, until I got that itch in my crotch.
The contusion on his left temple implies he was hit by a blunt object.
And the cuts imply a struggle.
- So it was murder? - But the question is who?
Well, whoever it was wears nail polish.
- We found traces in the wounds. - Well, that narrows it down. At least we know it wasn't the father.
Yeah, but we still gotta find out ...
Aaaaaaah ......... thank God.
Alright, FOX News auditions. Take 1.
And even though this Iraqi veteran lost his hands
he didn't lose his ability to feel.
I'm Lois Griffen for FOX News.
- Great story, Lois. - Thanks. I just made it up.
Y'know, I've been doing this job a long time, and I think  you've got what it takes.
Ha-haa. You're kidding. Really?
Yes. How would you like to be our newest on-air reporter?
W-w-well ... y'know I came down here not even thinking I had a shot
and now you're telling me this?
Gosh, it's an awfully big decision.
Lois, please. Take the job for FOX sake.
Well .... alright. I'll do it!
Great. Here's your contract.
Now run home Lois. Run as fast as you can.
A-a-a-a-a-h.
A-a-a-a-a-h.
A-a-a-a-a-h.
A-a-a-a-a-h.
A-a-a-a-a-a-h.
Good morning everyone. Well, do I look TV ready?
Lois, I can't believe you're doing this. If you work for FOX News you're  going to be selling your soul.
Oh, Brian, come on! They're a major news network.
I would think you would be excited for me.
Are you kidding? They're a lie factory. They report whatever they damn well please.
Y'know Brian, you're welcome to come with me to see for yourself that it's all on the level.
Y'now, I just might take you up on that, Lois.
And I know another way we can take advantage of this.
Chris ... Meg. Meet me in the living room in 10 minutes and bring a pencil and paper.
- Dad? What are we doing? - Meg, now that Lois has connections at FOX,
we are gonna invent our own cartoon show.
And we are here to brainstorm ideas. Alright, GO!
Anything that pops into your head.
Ooh ... how about a show about a bunch of disabled ducks
and we'll call it "Handi-Quacks."
Wow, caught fire a little earlier than I thought we would, Perfect!
Alright, let's spend many hours on this. Alright, the main duck ... what's his name?
I don't know, uh ... Red Hynie Monkey?
Ha-ha-ha, I love it. I love it. Alright, now what's his wacky neighbour duck's name?
Giddy Goose?
Meg, please try to formulate ideas clearly before you vocalize them.
I'm not sure you're gettin' the show, Meg.
Alright. Names. Names. Names. C'mon now.
Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.
Yes! Write it down. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
Maybe they live in a pond?
Chris, can I talk to you in the kitchen for a sec?
- I don't think she's gettin' it ... - I know she's not gettin' it, but ...
- There's no 'but', she's not gettin' it. - What the hell d'ya wanna do?
- She's poison. - Absolutely, she's dead weight.
- She doesn't understand. - .....it's just not funny
- She's completely ruining it. - Yeah, but I think it's important to have a female perspective in the room.
Alright, then I think we're going to have to expect nothing, right, and then
- maybe be pleasantly surprised. - OK.
Welcome to FOX News, Lois. We're very excited to have you.
Well, I'm excited to be here.
Oh, this is my dog, Brian. He was just dying to see the studio.
- Well, hi there, Brian. - How's it going, Adolf?
I'll have you know my grandparents died in the holocaust.
Ha-ha-ha, No, I'm just joking. They were there though.
This whole place just feels like a warm blanket.
I'll show you to our day care facilities shortly, but first let's have a look around.
This is our control room, where we have the ability
to monitor up to 500 different news stories in any given hour.
- What's that big button do? - Oh, that's kinda fun.
It emits a noise that only Al Gore can hear.
- There it is again. - It's probably just wind, honey.
It's not the wind!
And this is the kitchen. We've got all kinds of snacks and cold drinks in here.
Well, I don't see the refrigerator.
Oh, we just use Anne Coulter.
Hmmmmm......
There's never anything good in here.
Alright, here we go. Handy Quacks. Episode 1, scene 1.
Let's get 'em laughing right off the bat. "Interior, Red Hynie Monkey's house."
What's Red Hynie Monkey doing?
Um, maybe he just got up? He's making breakfast?
Ah, I don't think people eat breakfast anymore. More suggestions.
Ooh! What if Red Hynie Monkey and Poopy Faced Tomato Nose
are trying to build a house of cards
and it keeps falling down?
- Oh, ho-ho. Jiminy Christmas, we have all been there. That's goin' in.
Oh, we are cooking. Cooking, cooking, cooking.
Now. Alright. Let's take a walk down this road and see where it leads us.
Dialogue. What are they saying?
Umm ... maybe Poopy Faced  Tomato Nose says, uh ..
"Boy, this house of cards just doesn't wanna stay up."
Well, I mean, yeah, if you wanna go right at it like a neanderthal
sure, but I think we're shooting for a little more subtilty here, y'know.
Y'know, I don't believe that. I don't believe that that's a
real conversation when I hear it. People don't talk like that, Meg.
Oooh ...oooh! What if they just bought a new wood stove
and Red Hynie Monkey says, "Boy, it's so hot in here because we just bought that new wood stove
(Both) and we're sweating, and our hands are all slippery
and that's why we can't get the card house to stay up."
Thank you, Chris. We have lift off! Ha ha ha!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry but none of this stuff seems to make sense.
I mean, we haven't even referenced the fact that they're ducks
or that they're handicapped. But the show is called "Handi-Quacks."
Uh-huh. Chris, can I see you in the kitchen?
- This is not working out. This is not workin' .. - Dad, Dad, she's trying ....
- She gets along with everybody. - She does not get along with everybody.
- She's kinda hot. - She's 'Office' hot.
- You're right. You're right. - She's the only woman around.
Yeah, in the real world she doesn't know about it.
And in addition to everything else, she's GOT B.O.!!
She's got B.O.
Alright, Lois, for your first assignment we want you to do
an investigative expose on one of America's greatest enemies.
Oh, that sounds important. Who is it?
Michael Moore.
Oh, here we go. This is exactly what I was talking about, Lois.
FOX News will take down anyone who doesn't agree with them.
Wha...? Now wait a minute, Brian. Give him a chance.
What exactly do you want me to do?
We have reason to suspect that Michael Moore
may be a closet homosexual. We need you to get the proof.
Well, if you think that Michael Moore's possible homosexuality
is news worthy, I'll do my best to get the story.
Alright, I have come up with a design for Red Hynie Monkey
the head of the Handi-Quacks.
I want only positive feedback, please.
Why does he have such a big red bum?
Because it's funny, Meg.
People will tune in to Handi-Quacks each week
and see that big red bum and get a big laugh out of it.
Why? Because it's relatable.
- They'll see themselves in it. - I think the design is great, Dad.
Good note. Good note. OK, now I also had a thought for a female character
who's always nagging at Red Hynie Monkey, and telling him not
to leave his beer cans lying around and what-not.
And her name is Bitch Duck.
- That kinda looks like mom. - Not finished talking, Meg.
OK, and this is Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.
You can see I gave him a funny little suitcase.
Now, see the joke is, most people only carry
a suitcase when they're going on vacation.
But Poopy Faced Tomato Nose carries one all the time.
And see, he's got a sleeve hangin' out. He didn't pack it right.
Oh, well, you know what could be funny?
Maybe one week he actually goes on vacation.
And ... he's already got the suitcase.
Chris, can I see you in the kitchen for a sec?
Your writing partner is out of her mind. - OK first of all stop calling her my parsha.
- She's terrible. - I know that.
But you know what? It's not fair to her.
- Well, that's sort of a cop out. - Having her here is not fair to her.
Dad, if you want to fire her, you go ahead and fire her.
But don't pretend that you're doing it for her benefit.
- Don't put that on me, she firing herself. - She's can't fire herself.
- No, you decide ... - She's firing herself. - She's can't fire herself.
- You decided ... - And her lack of talent and her lack of funniness...
I just, y'know I just feel that you and I have captured lightning in a bottle with the Handi-Quacks.
- We have. Yes! - And she's just coming in, unscrewin' the top and lettin' it all out.
Meg, you're services will no longer be needed.
Ah, still nothing.
I don't understand. The lights are on. Somebody must be home.
Aah! Get down.
Rush Limbaugh?
What's he doing coming out of Michael Moore's house at this hour?
Unless .... Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's true!
Michael Moore is gay with Rush Limbaugh!
And I just laid in dog poop.
That's not dog poop. Sorry, we've been out here a long time.
And look, there's Rush Limbaugh coming out of Michael Moore's house at 2 in the morning.
I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it myself.
Well, your dog was right, Lois. Looks like there's no story here.
- Michael Moore is clearly not gay. - Wha...? No story?
What are you talking about? You're the one who sent me to
investigate, and now I'm showing you proof and you're dismissing it?
I don't understand.
Lois, I'll be honest. Rush Limbaugh is one of us.
We have no wish to smear a fellow conservative.
That would be as foolish as F.D.R hiring that midget press secretary.
The President has just confirmed a devastating surprise attack
by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.
Much of our naval fleet has been destroyed
and the death toll is believed to be in the thousands.
He's adorable!
OK, actors. Welcome to the first voice record for Handi-Quacks.
Alright. Episode 1. "What the Duck?" Take 1.
Oh, darn it, Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.
I know, Red Hynie Monkey. This card house won't stay up.
Probably because the wood stove is so warm.
It's making our hands sweaty and slippery.
It's all comin' together.
It's all comin' together. This is it. Our vision. Come to life.
I know. Just listen to that voice.
And then picture him holding that suitcase with the sleeve sticking out.
Ha-ha.
- Hi, everybody. - Hello, Colonel Tush Finger.
I just built a space ship. Wanna come up in space with me in it?
Whoa. Whoah, Whoah, Whoah. Cut. Cut. Cut, Cut.
Cleveland. What are you doing?
I just figured I'd give Colonel Tush Finger an Australian thing.
Colonel Tush Finger lives on the moon, you idiot!
He talks with a moon accent. Y'know?
He. talks. like. this. with. a. moon. accent.
You understand? I. am. Colonel. Tush. Finger. and. I. live. on. the. moon
so. I. talk. like. this. with. a. moon. accent. Do that!
- You know, Bonnie also acts. - Oh, here we go.
So they want me to drop the story completely because they don't want to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
Now do you see what I was saying about FOX News?
They have an incredibly biased agenda.
- You should do the story anyway. - You think so?
Absolutely. They're hypocrites. They wanted you to do the story when they
thought it would embarrass Michael Moore, but they don't want you to
do it if it's going to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
But you didn't want me to do the story when it was gonna embarrass Michael Moore.
But you want me to do the story if it's gonna embarrass Rush Limbaugh?
Can you picture the 2 of those guys pokin' each other in the chops?
Eeuugh! It'd be like sticking your arm in a backed up sink.
OK. You're right. I'm a little biased myself but at least I'm willing to admit it.
Imagine that? The 2 of them going at it?
An oversized Armani suit and an oversized cheap wind breaker tossed casually on the floor.
Look, they started this, Lois. But it's up to you to finish it.
I guess you're right, Brian.
Next day at work, Limbaugh finds a Detroit Tigers ball cap up in there.
- Stewie, shut up! - Why? It's just a weird image.
Like the way Commissioner Gordon tells Batman that he just took a poop.
Eeuugh! I don't need to know about that.
Thanks for hearing our pitch, Mr Chernin.
You realise that the only reason I'm taking this meeting is that
your wife is a reporter for our news division?
You have absolutely no prior credits.
Sir, I promise you won't regret it.
Handi-Quacks is going to be the next Simpsons.
We fire the jokes at you like an automatic weapon of comedy.
We throw a curve ball joke at you, hit you right in the head
You go "Wow, what happened?"
Hmmmmmmm.
We take you on a little trolley ride down story lane. You're havin' a good time,
enjoying out little tale, think you know what's coming. BOOM!
Left turn! You don't know how it happened. You don't know where you are, but you like it.
Uh-huh?
You're watchin' the show. The ducks are sayin' stuff.
You're yukking it up, you're laughing, your sides are hurting. All of a sudden you realise,
you're feeling something too.
When did that happen?
When did the Handi-Quacks become people I care about?
When did they become like welcome guests in your home
whose weekly visits the whole family eagerly awaits?
Take a look at what we got, Peter.
# One day 3 ducks were crossing the road #
# Going to get some soda #
# But they weren't looking where they were going #
# And a bus came along and hit them all #
# Now they're handicap-ded
Yeah ... Uh ... N-no, that's pretty much it..
# Handi-Quacks #
# And they never got their soda #
Why won't this card house stay up?
Our palms are slippery and sweaty because of the heat from that new wood stove we just bought.
(Giggles) That's gonna be his catch phrase.
How did you afford that wood stove?
Easy. I just walked into the wood stove store and said
"Put it on my bill."
- Ha ha ha ha ha ha. - Ah ha ha. You with me?
- I sure am. - You're with me now?
- I love it. - You know you love it.
I just have one small change.
- Oh? - Could Poopy Faced Tomato Nose's nose be a plum?
How dare you?
It's a small change. And if you do it, we'll really get behind this show.
A plum? What is this .... 1986?
Well, if you're gonna be a TV producer, you've gotta be open to collaboration.
So everybody just gets to stick their big chef's spoon  into my comedy gumbo, eh?
Well, no deal!
You know something? I like your passion.
OK, we'll do the show, and we'll do it your way.
No.
Well, that was a miscalculation.
Alright, there it is. Stay close to me.
Aah, this is it. Let's go.
Mr Moore. Mr Limbaugh. Do you have anything to say to FOX News about this ...
What the hell??
Who are you?
What's that suit on the bed?
And what have you done with your gay lover, Rush Limbaugh?
Aaaah. I am Rush Limbaugh. That's a costume.
Wait a minute! You mean all these years Rush Limbaugh
has just been Michael Moore in disguise?
Well, it's a little more complex than that.
What are you talkin' about?
- Fred Savage?! - Wait a minute. You're Rush Limbaugh AND Michael Moore?
Yes I am. They're both characters I created.
But ...... why?
Well, after the Wonder Years I was hungry to do more acting but the pickings were slim
so I came up with this scheme to satisfy my need to perform
and I guess it got a little out of hand.
This is unbelievable.
Well that's not the end of it.
I'm also Tony Danza, Camryn Manheim, Malcolm-Jamar Warner,
Kevin Nealon, John Forsythe,
and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.
Wow! Fred Savage is the greatest actor in the history of the world.
That's all I ever wanted people to know.
Well if you let us run this story, I promise you they will.
You got a deal.
Well, it finally happened.
I had finally gotten the recognition I deserved.
I don't need you anymore!!
This Sunday on FOX, it's the new hit comedy
starring America's greatest actor, Fred Savage.
Well, Lois, you did a good thing for a talented guy.
Yeah, but that should've been our timeslot.
Well I'm just glad that everything's back to normal.
I don't think I was cut out to be a TV reporter.
Yeah, how did you lose your job there anyway?
Oh, I don't know. Do you really care, Peter?
Does anyone really care?
Yeah, you're right.
The story's over. Everything will be back to normal next week.
So yeah, who gives a damn.
Anybody got any more jokes?
Stewie? Anything funny? No?
Brian? Meg? Chris?
No?
Alright. See ya folks.



Title: Not All Dogs Go to Heaven

The annual Quahog Star Trek convention.
Where once a year sci-fi buffs take their lips off the barrel of the loaded gun and spend half a day adjusting their eyes to sunlight
Oh, this sucks, mom. Why are we even here?
Honey, your father's been waiting all year for this.
Especially since he got kicked out of the last one.
Yes, I have a question for Captain Kirk.
Uh, in that episode where you drown your wife, why are you so fat?
Brian, look. I've purchased authentic blue prints to build a Star Trek transporter.
That's great Stewie. You should get William Shatner to sign 'em for you.
No way. I'm getting Patrick Stewart to sign it.
Picard has it all over Kirk.
He's poised and measured and doesn't wear a chear lug.
Rather he excepts even boldness with a quiet cool that says:
"I am in command. You are safe with me.
I will cradle you in my arms though any crisis in any galaxy."
- Are you queer? - Probably
Dad, this is stupid. I'm so bored.
How can you be bored? This convention has everything!
You can even try LeVar Burton's visor!
Why would he wear these? Who would invent these for him?
And in conclusion,
whether your dreams are earthbound or set in the stars - follow your heart.
And.. make it so.
Ooooh, oh boy. He always says the things he says on TV
Now the cast and I would be happy to answer a few questions.
Oh, yes, so many questions. Me, me!
Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart!
Yes, you there.
Yes, I have a question.
Um, often times my household's sponges accumulate an awful amount of buildup.
- What can I do to prevent this? - That's an exellent question.
It's very important to thoroughly wring out your sponges after every usage.
This will prevent the accumulation of grime and bacteria.
A dry sponge is a happy sponge.
That's not a Star Trek question!
I have a question for Jonathan Frakes.
I have this itch on the back of my leg. And I can't figure out if it's a bug bite or dry skin?
- Do you take hot showers? - Yes.
- Dry skin. - Thanks.
These aren't Star Trek questions, what the hell?
I have a question for Gates McFadden
I've got an artesian well on my property and the water pressure is lousy.
- Any suggestions? - I would check the point first, before re-priming it.
But remember that the summer months take a particular toll on any region's aquafer, depending on the local climate.
- This is horseshit! - And that's the last question
Thank you for coming. You've been wonderful.
You bastards. I'll get my question answered one way or another.
Oh my God, what a great costume!
Meg, Meg! Come take your picture with this space alien guy!
- No dad, I don't want to! - Come on, it'll be funny.
What a wonderful novelty photo this will make.
Thank you so much buddy. Hey, how did you make that awesome mask?
It's not a mask, I have the mumps.
What? You came to a Star Trek convention with the mumps,
you could be infecting people with a disease!
Yeah, like that old gipsy did to Britney Spears in that Stephen King book.
Thicker.
Well, Meg has the mumps alright.
How is it she was never immunised.
Well, it was 1992 and I couldn't be bothered with anything that didn't involved Dan Cortese
- Besides, what's a big deal? I never got a mumps shot. - Really?
Well, I caution you, that getting the mumps as an adult could result a serious complications.
In some cases the symptoms could spread to the testicular glands.
Big deal, so I wear socks.
Mr. Griffin, your testicles are not on your feet.
- Oh, where are they? - Under your penis.
Are you kidding? I always thought those were two little sandbags to keep floodwaters from floating into my bum
No, no. I'm just poking at your funny bone. I am quite alarmed.
I don't think you realize the danger.
Like the people who think it's OK to bring shampoo on an airplane.
So I told Brenda:
I work hard, I like a clean house when I come home.
And now I'm the bad guy.
-Oh, I know exacltly what you... - Oh, It's in my eyes!
See, Chris, come here, come here, look. Check it out.
- Holy crap, no way! - I know, classic!
I gotta forward this to my bud.
Meg, I know you hate having to be in bed all day, but
your father's bringing in the old TV. - Hey Meg!
- Peter, what the hell? - I don't wanna catch the mumps, Lois.
Here's your TV, Meg. It's a little old and there is no remote and it only gets one channel and it's not on that channel right now.
Chris, check it out. Jackass number two.
This whole day is been one big laugh riot.
- Finally! - Up next Kirk Cameron.
- To talk about God. - Aww.
Hi, welcome to the Religion channel number one show.
"Kirk and the Lord" just hanging. With me, Kirk Cameron.
Today, I'm gonna tell you why God will always be there for you.
- Even in the worst of times. - No thanks.
But first, are you lonely, unappreciated?
Not totally happy with your physical appearance? - Go on.
Are you unloved? Do you feel like no one cares about you?
Meg, your mother made soup for you.
Here you go honey.
Well, you know who does love you? The Lord.
Here's your milk!
Rupert, my transporter is complete.
If my calculations are correct the cast of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" will soon be here to anwser all my questions!
Wait a minute, something's wrong.
Alright, you girls ready?
What's goin on? Don't you laugh at it?
Good morning mom and dad!
Wow, look who's finally out of her room after five days.
- So you feel better Meg? - All better mom.
I was made well by the hand of God.
This is the day that the Lord hath made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
- Meg, what are you talking about? - I'm talking about God mom, I've been reborn.
That's right folks. It's gonna be a Meg episode. Stick around for the fun.
Here's the clicker. No one'd blame ya.
- What do you mean you found the Lord? - I've been washed in the blood of the lamb.
Kirk Cameron explained it all to me. The Lord is my saviour.
It's that damn religion channel. She was watching it all day while she was bedridden.
I want to share the word of God with everyone I know. Starting with my family.
Now, everyone hold hands because we are gonna say grace before we eat.
Dad, would you like to do the honors?
Are you kidding? I'd love a chance to shine.
All right Peter, this is it.
Dear Lod, please give me the cheat codes from "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out"
I have been stuck on "Bold Ball" for four years.
I tried Left-Left-Up-B-dodge-uppercut, but it still knocks me out.
And you know, they say your supposed to go Right-B-Up-dodge-Left-uppercu...
Listen to me, telling you how to play a game.
All right, let's try this again.
It's them. I did it!
The cast of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" is here to anwser my questions!
- What the hell, where am I? - What's goin on?
Greeting everyone, my name is Stewie Griffin.
I've transported you all here against your will.
I'm a huge fan. And you are going to answer all my questions.
- But.. you're a baby. - Yes, that's right Denise Crosby.
That was a warning. Please, do not speak unless you are spoken to.
Now. Question number one.
What's it like on the set?
The show's been off the air for fifteen years
Although I will say it was an awful lot of fun.
You know, when Patrick wasn't hogging the limelight.
Oh fuck you Michael! Fifteen years later you still got that attitude.
Oh my God! I'm already having a fantastic time.
- Let's spend a day together! - Hey, that sounds like fun!
- Shut up Wil. - Stop it Patrick!
- You know, I think you should all be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton - The way I treat my...
- Wait, what? - I said you ought to be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton
- You mean Wil Wheaton? - Yes, Hwil Hwheaton.
Why are you saing it like that?
What? I'm just saying, you should be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton. Hwil Hwheaton seems like a nice guy.
- Say "wheat" - Wheat.
- Now, say Wil Wheaton - Hwil Hwheaton
- Wil Wheaton - Hwil Hwheaton
- Wil Wheaton - Hey, did you hook up with Whoopi Goldberg on the show?
All the time.
- Meg, what the hell? I was watching that.
It's time for Kirk Cameron!
And I think it's important for all of you to hear his inspiring message about the word of God.
Oh, again Meg?
You know I think it's wonderful you found something to have faith in but there is such a thing as moderation.
Mum, you sound like a non-believer.
Brian, you're thoughtful person.
Are you willing to open yourself up to God's truth?
Oh, you're barking up the wrong tree, Meg, I'm an atheist.
- What's that? - I.. don't believe in God.
What? Brian?
- How can you say that? - Why? I just thought
you knew. I mean, I never go to church.
You know how I feel about that.
Brian, it's one thing to bash organized religion, but
we believe in God in this house,
I mean an atheist... that's just about the worst thing a person can be!
You're not gonna get anything for Christmas, Brian!
- Guys, I'm just trying to say.. - Shut up beast!
I have dominion over you and I command you to believe in God!
I'm sorry, I just don't see any evidence.
I mean, look at the Hubble telescope.
It's discovered untold wonders of a vast unexplored universe.
But not one picture of a guy with a beard sitting around on a cloud.
I mean what's he doing up there?
You know, you keep talking like that, God's gonna get you, Brian.
He's gonna get you with the Kodak disc.
Oh God's gonna get you with the Kodak disc!
I'm sorry. What were we talking about?
Hey! Where the hell is my van?
Stewie, I'm not really much of a fast food eater.
Yeah? Can you read my mind?
Can you tell what I'm thinking right now? I'm thinking "Shut up and get a salad"
- I want some McNuggets! - We'll get to you, Brent.
I'm wanna hamburger. No, a cheeseburger.
- I wanna hotdog, I wanna milk shake - You'll get nothing and like it!
- Hello? - Yes, welcome to MacDonald's. Can I help you?
Hailing frequency's open, huh?
Oh yeah, we're gonna get two McChicken sandwiches and a diet coke and..
- What do you want Michael? - A McB.L.T.
No, I already told you they don't make those anymore!
You know, sometimes it's a regional thing.
- You could ask. - No MacDonald's anywhere makes a McB.L.T anymore!
- I'd love a shamrock shake if they got any of those. - It's September Jonathan!
Stewie, can I take this fucking headband off?
No LeVar, you're blind, that's the only way you can see.
Just saying they have all the ingredients for a McB.L.T.
Just hang on, alright? There's a lot of us, it, there's a lot of.. It's a big order!
- What time do they stop serving breakfast? - It's 3 o'clock!
- Some of them serve breakfast allday. - NO ONE SERVE BREAKFAST ALLDAY!
Do they have beer?
Hey Brian! In hope you'll open your heart to God
I wanted to give you this cross.
- No, I don't wanna cross. - Would you want it if I threw it over there?
- No, please don't do that. - You gonna get it boy?
- No, please, no. - Go get it boy!
Okay, give it back now!
Brian, Kirk Cameron is the one who converted me
but unfortunately he's not available.
So, I got his younger brother from "Growing Pains"
Would you guys buy me a case of Sudafed?
Don't you wanna tell Brian about Jesus?
They got my picture up at the drug store and they won't sell me any Sudafed.
I'll make it worth your while.
Ben.
Dad.
Ben.
What have I told you about trading sexual favors for sudafed?
Look, Meg. I've had enough of this. You not gonna convert me.
But Brian! I just want you to feel the joy that I feel.
I mean the Church makes me feel accepted and safe
and part of something bigger that myself.
But Meg, you don't need an outside voice to feel those feelings, they're inside you.
What you call "God" is inside you, all of us.
And I just hate to see people hating and killing each other over their own interpretation of what they're not smart enough to understand.
- You see what I'm saying? - Oh I do Brian
And I think I know just what to do.
Good evening, I'm Tom Taker. Our top story tonight.
Just when you thought the world couldn't be any more dangerous
Channel 5 News has discovered that there is an atheist among us.
Local church goer and juniour christian soldier Meg Griffin
has identified the atheist as Brian Griffin of Spooner Street
Here's the reaction from City Hall.
Shocking to say the least.
I'd rather have a terrorist living on our midst.
At least they belive in a God. Even if it's a smelly brown God.
Meg, how the hell could you do something like this?
If a man hath ears, let him hear, Brian!
Alright, what's the worst that could happen, this is the twenty first century, people are tolerant.
Well, this is nothing, probably just a random act of violence.
I thought only he without sin could cast the first Prius.
Huh, my God. That was a close one.
Brian, what happened?
I'm a pariah, Lois
Ever since Meg told everyone I'm an atheist I'm the most hated person in town.
I try to rent a movie and they threw me out. I try to buy a pack of cigarettes and they threw me out.
But the most serious part of it is no bar would serve me a drink!
Well if you ask me me, I think laying off the sauce could do you some good Brian.
Yeah, right. If you need me I'll be in the kitchen.
I hope he finds faith of some kind.
You know who doesn't have all this problems? Marmaduke.
All he does is eat pies off the high counter.
Next time around we're gonna get ourselves a big tall pie-eating dog, Lois
- Okay Peter. - Or Howard Hughes. Let's get Howard Hughes!
Great, we have a game plan.
Hold it together, Brian, hold it together.
Come on! You know you want a drink.
Yeah, come on, Brian, drink us!
Come on, drink me! What are you waitng for?
Yeah you big silly arse. Just wrap your lips around me and take a big gulp.
Get to the chopper!
Alright, everybody got your bowling shoes, everybody got your balls.
I don't have my shoes.
- Jonathan, we were just up at the counter. Why didn't you get your shoes? - I don't have my shoes either.
- What the hell? You need your shoes to bowl. - Now, why exactly can I not wear my loafers?
- What is the danger there? - Because, Patrick, because, Patrick!
- Those are the rules. - Well I think it's just because they want another dollar fifty from me.
Alright, I'm putting our names in.
- Brent.. - No-no don't put Brent
- Put Rock Kickass - I don't know how to change it, I already typed it in!
For mine put Dirk Diggler.
I'm not gonna put everyone with a fake name!
How do you wanna do the teams?
- How about the white guys against the black guys? - Patrick, don't be an instigator.
- I have to pee. - Brent, take Michael to the bathroom, please.
Okay.
Look at me! I've got girl boobs!
Hey Meg! Guess what?
I've seen the light.
- Really? - Yes, hallelujah I believe in God. Lordy-lordy, I believe.
Brian, that's fantastic news!
I know, I know. Hey, you mind spreading the news around town, say
maybe down at the liquor store, maybe down at the Clam
Of course Brian, but first we have work to do.
God's work. And God will be happy that you're joining me.
Then I say let's celebrate the way they did in the bible.
With wine. Red wine. You know, like Jesus drank.
- Do you like the wine? - Very much, what is it?
Take a guess.
I have to leave.
Naaah, sit down.
Thanks for setting everyone straight, Meg.
I feel the warm healing liquid presence of God's genuine cold filtered grace.
It was my pleasure Brian.
And now, we get to do the work of the Lord.
- Come on! - What? What are we doing?
God's will Brian.
- A book burning? - Come on! Grab an arm full!
We have to destroy everything that's harmful to God!
Meg, I can't be a part of this. And either should you.
What are you talking about? I thought you'd seen the light, Brian!
Well, to be honest I lied for booze, but Meg, you're a smart girl
You ought to be able see that what's going on here is wrong!
You are not gonna turn me from my faith, Brian!
Ok, fine. Then let me just ask you this.
If there were a God would he put you here on Earth with a flat chest and a fat ass?
-I'm made in his image? - Really?
Would he give you a smoking hot mom like Lois and then have you grow up looking like Peter?
Well..
And what kind of God would put you in a house where no one respects or cares about you?
Not even enough to get you a damn mumps shot!
Oh, no!
You're right, Brian! You're right!
I'm sorry Meg.
But what is there to believe in without God?
Where do the answers come from?
Oh that's all part of the human experience. It's what we're here to find out.
And I bet you that the real answer to the nature of our existence
is gonna be more unimaginably amazing than we can possibly conceive.
Rob?
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
I swear I heard something.
There is nothing under your bed.
There is nothing in the closet.
There are no such things as monsters.
Alright?
- Alright I guess. - Good.
Now, try to go to sleep, cause we gotta get up in the morning and make movies.
We're big Hollywood actors.
Yeah we are!
This was exhausting.
This whole experience was absolutely exhausting.
You people have ruined "Star Trek: The Next Generation" for me
You are absolutely the most insufferable group of jackasses I've
ever had the misfortune of spending an extended period of time with.
I hope you all fucking die.
I still have five prize tickets from the carnival.
There was nothing for five tickets, we've been over this!
Well, but LeVar and I were going to pool ours for the Fuzzy Troll pencil topper
- Oh, yeah? You gonna share that? - Yeah, we were gonna share it!
- Really? How's that gonna work? - Three days at my house, three days at LeVar's and alternating sundays.
For a pencil topper?
- I have to pee again. - That's it. Goodbye.



Title: 420

Hey Quagmire.
Peter, I want you and the guys to come over to my house right now.
We're drinking. What for?
Just come over. I want you to see something.
Alright.
C'mon guys, we're going to Quagmire's.
Alright, hang on. I gotta go to the bathroom first.
OK, let's go.
Oh, finally!
C'mon, c'mon. C'mon inside.
Well, what is it? What's the big damn deal?
Look.
It's a cat.
Yeah, I just got him today.
His name's James.
Isn't he just the cutest thing you've ever seen?
Hi, James.
Oh my God!
Watch when I scratch his bottom. He sticks his fanny in the air.
Oh, oh. We have lift off. We have lift off.
Oh, come here, James.
What the hell we doin'.
Quagmire, since when do you like cats?
Since I found this little guy living under my house.
I'll tell you this ...
I understand now why the pharoahs worshipped these animals.
Oh look, Joe. He's making friends.
Oh, sorry.
Y'know ... y'know what? It's alright, Quagmire
That leg is mostly pus.
Oh, OK.
Here it comes, James.
Here comes the part I was telling you about.
Aaaaah! You're one of those.
I hate Quagmire lately.
Me too.
That cat has totally changed his personality.
Yeah, like when I went over to his house the other day.
Who is it?
It's me, Quagmire. I need to borrow your lawnmower.
Oh, Quagmire's not here It's just me, James.
I'm supposed to watch the house.
C'mon, Quagmire. It's 97° out here.
We're 2 grown men.
Are you selling yarn? 'Cos I love yarn.
No, I need to borrow your lawnmower.
Oh, I don't think Quagmire wants me to do that.
Oh, come on!
I don't think Quagmire appreciated the condition you returned it in last time.
Glenn, can I just ...
No, you can't have it.
Hey guys, it's James' birthday tomorrow.
Would you all sign his card?
You want us to sign a card for your cat?
Yeah. Don't just put your name, write something clever.
God, I hate having to come up with something on the spot.
Ummm.
Have a 'mice' day.
Best fishes.
Peter.
Thanks ...... that's great.
Well, I gotta get going.
I'm heading off to Vermont to get James' birthday present.
There's this neat little store called "Cattitudes"
that makes all this neat cat stuff.
See you guys later.
What a queer.
He's goin' all the way to Vermont for cat gifts and what-not?
You can get a scratcing post down at Wal Mart for $2.00
A pair of Lee jeans for $9.00
Y'know they got seats for children now? You put 'em right in your car.
Supposed to make 'em safer.
Only problem is, you can't lean your seat all the way back ... oh.
We gotta do somethin' about this.
His whole life is about that stupid cat.
Hey, y'know the cat's alone at Quagmire's right now.
Y'know what we should do?
We should go over there and shave it.
That's a great idea!
Let's do it!
Let's shave the cat!
Oh boy, I usually only get this excited
when they say the title of the movie in the movie.
I'm telling you these drug dealers represent
a Clear and Present Danger to the United States.
Eh? Eh? He said it. He said it.
All I'm sayin' is what if this As Good As It Gets?
Eh? Eh? There it is! There it is!
The only way for me to solve this crisis is to be Superman IV.
The Quest for Peace.
So that's why they call it that.
Alright, the cat's gotta be in here.
Hey, lets take a man- sized poop in his cat box
so he thinks there's something really wrong with him.
There it is!
Rock and roll!
Yeah! Shaving time!
Alright, hand me the razor.
Oh, my God!
Peter, you killed it!
Will you guys relax.
He's got 8 more lives.
OK, 7 more lives.
6.
5.
4.
3.
Peter, stop doin' what you're doin.
What'll we do?
Altight, alright. I have an idea.
How 'bout we hide the cat's body and leave that window open
and that way, it'll seem like the cat ran away.
We'll never get away with that.
Oh, we just might.
You see, I've got a lucky cat's foot.
Y'know, Peter, it's sorta adding insult to injury
raiding Quagmire's fridge for beer after you killed his cat.
Or is it?
Is my response.
Ah, crap!
God, I hate cops.
Almost as much as I hated my overly sensitive car alarm.
Son of a bitch!
Whatta we got, partner?
Empty alcohol containers.
The driver's inebriated and covered in blood.
He's got scratches on his face and arms.
There's a blood soaked corpse in the back seat.
He's got shovels in there, and a hand drawn map titled
"This is where we'll hide the body."
Well, that all seems fine.
Sorry to bother you. sir.
Pot! Small amount of pot!
You're under arrest, dirtbag!
Oh, come on!
I don't appreciate drug addicts in my town!
I'm a family guy.
Eh? Eh? He said it.
Alright, Brian, your family's here to bail you out.
Brian, if you don't mind,
we'll start thinkin' up our prison rape jokes immediately.
I'll break the ice.
Hey, Brian, did you do 'Hard Time' or 'Hardly Working?'
Penis.
Alright, well all the pieces are there.
Somebody make somethin' outta that.
Hey, Brian, who's your favorite baseball player?
Albert Pujols?
Chris, stop it! Come on.
Brian, we're happy you're out of jail.
And when we get to the car would you like a donut to sit on?
Ha ha ha. Y'see, I'm part of it. I'm part of it like everyone else.
I can't believe they threw me in jail for a quarter ounce of pot.
Well, Brian, it's your own fault.
I mean, pot is illegal for a reason.
Lois, don't be a hypocrite.
You've smoked pot.
Well sure, Brian,
but I'm thinkin' about the children.
Pot's illegal mainly to protect them.
No, no. Pot is illegal because William Randolph Hearst
ran a smear campaign against marijuana in the 1930's
to protect his interests in the timber industry
because hemp was poised to replace wood
as an inexpensive raw material for the manufacture of paper.
There's your smear campaign right there, Brian.
Ah-ha-ha.
Mom's right.
Drugs are bad, Brian.
I mean, haven't you seen those commercials?
Open up, Brian, it's Joe.
Crap!
Uh, uh, j-just a sec.
Brian, under your probation
you're required to submit to random drug tests.
I need some urine.
You mean .... right now?
Yes. Right now.
Here's some magazines to get you going.
Uh, how's that gonna ... ?
Oh, sorry. It's been a while.
Look, I don't really feel comfortable doing this in front of you.
Fine, I'll wait outside.
Here's a bottle of lotion.
Aah, Joe ...
Right. Sorry.
Stewie, I need your urine.
Huh ... Really?
Yeah. Joe's doing a drug test and if I give him some of mine
he's gonna know I've been smoking pot
so I need some of your urine so I can ...
Uh ... you don't have to be naked for this.
But I don't have to NOT be naked for it, either. Ah-ha ...
Come on, Stewie,
hurry up and pee.
Joe's waiting for me.
Brian, you know I can't go unless you stare at it.
Brian, what the hell ... ?
Uhh ... hey, Lois
The jig's up, Brian.
Run!
Brian, is this how you're trying to pass your drug test?
By stealing a baby's urine?
My God, that is just sick!
No, what's sick is making marijuana illegal
when it's been proven that it does less damage to you than alcohol.
No, what's sick is the plot of the movie "Baby Mama."
What happens when a 40 year old woman
asks her 41 year old friend to carry her baby?
Push, Angie, push harder ... Oh, it's dead.
Brian, when you have to go to these lengths
just to get away with smoking pot
it's time to make a change.
You're right, Lois.
It is time to make a change.
Thank you.
It's time for Quahog to legalize marijuana!
But that's not exactly what I meant.
Hey, check out the size of Stewie's penis.
Oh, come on guys,
it's just the way God made me.
No more oppression!
We, as American adults with free will
have the right to use marijuana if we choose to!
Enough government profiteering under the guise of morality!
Enough with this phony war on drugs!
You know, you're going about this all wrong, Brian.
If you want to win people over,
you can't just drone on like Ben Stein.
You've got to have a little more showmanship.
Here, watch.
# Now everybody gather round #
# and listen if you would #
# When I tell you every person needs a way of feeling good #
# Every kitty needs a ball of string and every dog a stick #
# but all you need is a bag of weed to really get a kick #
# 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 #

There you go ...
... you're all gettin' it now.
They go all sort of queer.
They rent "The Rocketeer."
He humps a guy like me
Right!
# but all we need is a bag of weed #
# to keep us worry free #
# 1 - 2 - 3 #
# Oh, a bag of weed, a bag of weed #

As mayor of Quahog
I hereby sign into law, the legalization of marijuana.
Good evening everyone.
Our top story: "Marijuana is now legal"
Le..le... is now legal.
Legal in Quahog
And it's made everything ...
... just so great.
OK, you ... you can read the next one.
No, you can.
No, you.
OK, OK, OK.
L..let..let's read it both together.
- Ready? - OK ... OK
Here's Ollie Williams with the black you weather forecast.
How's the weather look, Ollie?
Not too bad.
Right on!
See Lois?
Tell me things in Quahog aren't better now.
It's just weird, Brian.
I still don't think I'm comfortable with the whole idea.
Look Lois, ever since marijuana was legalized ...
... crime has gone down, productivity is up,
and ratings forl Dr. Who are through the roof.
Yeah, but Peter's so vague lately
he can hardly set up a cut away.
Man, this is even better than ...
Uh, no, wait ...
No, this is worse than ...
Thi ... Ah, better ...
I dunno.
Here's a list of celebrities I don't like:
Hello, Griffin
Mr Pewterschmidt?
- Hey, how ya been? - Not good.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow, a limo, huh?
Hey, are these Diet Rites just to take?
No!
Those are my Diet Rites!
Now listen, Griffin.
Thanks to your dog's stupid marijuana crusade,
people are using hemp for everything.
Fabric, fuel ... and paper.
Which means I'm losing billions in timber dollars.
I had to sell my Bangles records.
I was still working on memorizing all the words.
My back is hurting from the chair I'm sitting on.
Where's the Tylenol?
If I lay down flat on the floor
It usually kinda fixes it.
Tony Danza
from Who's the Boss says
Eh-oh ... Eh-oh ...
Oh-eh .. oh-eh-ohhhhh ...
I'm losing money, and it's your dog's fault.
Now, I have to get hemp illegalized again.
And the only way to do that is to start a fear campaign
designed to turn people against pot.
Will you help me?
Gosh, Mr. Pewterschmidt
I .. I could never go against Brian like that.
I'll give you this light up butterfly yo-yo.
- Ohhh, to keep? - Not to keep!
You can use it today, and one more day in the summer.
- Yeah! - Pull over.
Bye.
Alright, Carter
I've finished cutting together our anti-pot video.
Take a look.
Hey, I got a great idea.
Let's kill 6 million Jews.
Hooray! Yeah!
Yeah, I'm on board.
How did you come up with that?
I got the idea ... from ... from ... while ...
... from while I was smoking pot.
Anyone else who likes pot, reach for my joint.
Oh, there it is.
Give us some of that.
Ha  ha  ha, perhaps later.
Now let's go to France and steal all their objects ... de... arte ...
Yay! Alright! Let's go to France!
- Not bad, uh? - Ah, damn it.
That was FOX News.
Apparently they own the rights to Hitler's likeness
and they won't have him slandered.
Hi, I'm Peter.
You know me from the movie
"Harold, Kumar and Peter go to White Castle"
As you can see, I'm enjoying a White Castle burger.
Why?
Because I don't do drugs.
It took me 5 minutes to get to White Castle.
I didn't get diverted by all those crazy hijinks.
'Cos I don't get high.
It was a good movie, though.
Y'know, Neil Patrick Harris got the job on "How I Met Your Mother" 'cos of that movie?
Y'know, I've only seen that show once
but I gotta tell ya, what's really weird to me
is why is the voice of the guy from the future, Bob Saget?
I mean, the guy on the show ... he's already an adult.
Y'know, so it's not like he's gonna grow in to Bob Saget.
Doesn't make sense.
Thank you for your time.
Well, what do you think?
Look, daddy, I agree with what you're trying to do,
but I just don't think this is gonna work.
It's so artificial.
You're asking for a spanking, young lady.
Yeah!
All right!
Peter, the reason Brian succeeded in his cause
is that he spoke with such passion.
No offence,
but you two just don't have that talent.
Are you kiddin'?
I can be very persuasive.
That's how I used to lure wayward sailors
to their deaths with my Siren song.
Hello, Brian.
You're looking good.
Nice shiny coat.
Don't try to butter me up, Carter.
Why did you call me here?
Come inside.
There's something I want to show you.
What's this?
It's your novel, Brian,
"Faster than the speed of Love"
Ready to ship out tomorrow.
All you have to do is publicly come out against pot.
Forget it, Carter
I'm not gonna take your bribe.
I don't care if you printed a million copies.
I printed TWO million.
And I even commissioned an oil painting for your author's photo.
And what's this?
Is this an Oprah Book Club sticker?
I think it is.
Wait! Really?
Oh, my God.
Plus I can get you a night in bed with Oprah.
- Eeerrrr ......? - OK, just the sticker then.
So whatta you say?
Is it a deal?
You don't have to sell out like this, Brian
Your novel .. is good enough .. to be published .. on it's own .. merits
You think so?
Yeah, you bet.
This is your shot, Brian
You can be a superstar author.
All you gotta do is make an impassioned anti-pot speech in public.
Forget it, Carter
Even Stewie says the book is good enough on its own.
Right, Stewie?
... Ermmm ... maybe do a song about why pot is bad.
# And that's why pot is bad #
I've heard all I need to make an informed decision.
Marijuana is hereby re-illegalized.
In other news,
a local Quahog author has set a record for the worst selling novel of all time.
Brian Griffin's "Faster than the speed of Love"
has astonishingly not sold a single copy
thanks to universal panning by literary critics.
Coming up, children are getting sexier ...
and that's ...
... that's pretty cool.
This is so humiliating.
I sold out everything I believed in,
and I have nothing to show for it.
My book's a bomb!
Well, look at it this way ....
you did accomplish something.
Marijuana's illegal because of you,
and Stewie got to build a nice little fort with all of your unsold books.
My house is made of mediocrity.
Hey, guys.
I want you to know I'm raising my reward to 50 dollars
for anyone who can help me find James.
No questions asked.
I killed your cat.



Title: Stew Roids

Oh, Joe, thank you so much for  inviting us to your barbeque.
Well, it's my pleasure, Lois.
Hey, can one of you weathermen come over here
and comment on the meat while I'm cookin' it?
Yeah, I got it.
Oh, yeah. Oh, those are lookin' good.
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah, don't flip 'em too often, now. You don't wanna lose the juices.
Yeah, yeah. Comin' along nicely.
Oh, those are cookin' just fine.
Scoop that one up and put it back down in the exact same spot.
Alright, they're done! Time to eat!
Oh boy! I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse.
I ... errr ... I mis-spoke.
Wow, Bonnie, you really took off the baby weight quickly.
Oh, thanks, Lois
Hey, do mind rubbing some of that sun-block on my back?
Of course, Bonnie.
Ooh, but I don't wanna get any on my shirt.
Mmm ... that feels good.
Um, you're going a little low there, Lois
Ah-ha ha, ok, I'm sorry.
Giggety!
Ah, Joe, Susie's such a cute baby.
Hey, whatever happened to your son, Kevin?
He died in Iraq.
Sad.
I won't let you walk out of here without that dress.
Oh, I don't know ...
- Will I ever wear it? - Yes you will.
You've got that thing for the opening of the library next week.
It's perfect for that.
Hey, everybody!
Oh, look, it's Black Barbie!
And why are you all alone?
Oh, they discontinued my boyfriend.
Mom says I'm the one who's hair it's OK to cut.
Hey! I was playing with that!
Hey, come back here!
Alright, you asked for it.
Holy crap!
Alright, let's try that one again.
Oh, my God, Stewie!
Ha! Your kid got beat up by a baby girl.
Oh man, this is more painful to watch than when Family Ties does a Tina Yothers episode.
Jennifer, What happened in school today?
I got my period!
And I will see the Keaton family next week.
Ok, now, sweetie. This isn't gonna hurt at all.
Aaahh! Those lying bastards at Johnson and Johnson!
We'll put "No More Tears" on the label.
- But, it does make you cry. - I know.
Heh heh heh! Ah hah! Ha ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Lois, you should just let those wounds get infected.
It'll teach him a lesson about being tough.
Peter, he's just a baby.
You gotta let this go.
My baby boy got beat up by a girl!
What was weird, was that she was crying ...
... but the way she was standing over me, made it look like I was crying.
Which was weird.
Peter, what exactly are you worried is gonna happen because of this?
World War 5!
Peter, we've been over this ...
There has to be a World War 3 and 4 first.
Oh, no. Oh, no
That's the beauty of World War 5, Lois.
It's so intense, it skips over the other two.
Peter, it doesn't work ...
I have spoken!
Huuh! There's Connie D'Amico
Chris, don't walk next to me.
Hi, Connie.
Uh, so, I heard you talking in the hall the other day
about how much you liked High School Musical 2,
so I burned you the soundtrack.
OK, prepare for itemised insults.
A: Don't ever listen to me talk.
You don't deserve my words.
B: When I said I enjoyed it, I was speaking ironically.
And ... C: You actually liked High School Musical?
What are you, 8?
No, that's impossible, because I've seen that big
hairy mud flap arse of yours in the locker room.
Questions?
Hey, Meg, take that!
Ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
That was awesome!
The joke's kind of on us, 'cos we're smellin' it.
- Yeah! - Awesome!
Oh, way to go, folks!
Ugh! Scott is such an idiot!
I'm totally breaking up with him.
I'm gonna switch to one of the other popular guys.
But Connie, you've gone out with, like, every popular boy in this school.
Ah, yeah, you're right!
God, they all suck so much!
I need a new challenge.
What if ... wait, now bear with me on this ...
What if I date a loser and make him over into a popular guy?
Wow, great idea! I'm glad I hung in there.
Now, who are the biggest losers in this school?
Well, there's Smiley McGee.
Hello!
Nah. I hear he's a bed wetter.
And ... Chris Griffin
Oh, my God! I could smell him from here.
He's perfect.
God, you're right!
He smells like Fred Flinstone's arse!
Hey! No-one's askin' you to smell it.
Alright, Stewie, your dad's gonna help you learn how to be a man.
Real men have a couple of beers,
and then project their inadequacies on their kids.
- OK. - What's that?
You think you're better than me?
What? No, I didn't say that.
So I guess you think you woulda been some sort of big shot by my age, huh?
Done things differently? Gotten that promotion?
I don't even know what you do.
Well, let me tell you somethin' ...
You're nothin'! And you're never gonna be nothin'!!!
Now, let's sit here and watch Spike TV.
Spike TV 
Full of stuff men like.
Yeah, that stuff.
Wow, my favorite.
P B and J with the crust cut off.
What'd you get?
Your crusts.
That's it?
No, I also got an orange peel and a picture of mom eating a turkey leg.
Oh my God, Connie's coming over to talk to me!
Sit up straight!
Hey, Meg, nice posture. Get lost.
Thank you.
Chris Griffin, you are undoubtedly the most unpopular boy in school.
I am? What about Smiley McGee over there?
Hello!
You and I are going on a date Saturday night.
Um ... OK.
I'll see you then.
Why would she go out with me?
She must be more drunk than  Santa Claus when he got that D.U.I.
No, no, it wasn't my fault.
Some guy in a Plymouth totally cut me off.
Sir, they don't make Plymouths anymore.
Are you Jewish?
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step outta the sleigh.
Alright, Stewie, we're gonna get you nice and pumped up.
Now, you see that barbell over there?
Go ahead and try and lift that.
Uh-oh, spadoody-O's!
I noticed your kid is having some trouble.
You're tellin' me.
Oh, your kid just needs a little help.
I got something that'll get him going.
Well, if there's anyone I can trust
it's a stranger at the gym holding a dirty needle.
Here, Stewie, try this.
Yaah! What the hell are you do .... ?
Whoa! Oh my ... suddenly I'm full of energy.
Alright, fat man, let's do this!
Wow, Stewie, you look like a new man.
Well, will you look at me. I HAVE THE POWER!!
We now return to "Lady and the Tramp" and Michael Vick.
Hello, family.
Aaaaarrrr ... !!
Does anyone need the remote?
Oh, my God!
What the hell happened to Stewie?
Yeah, looks good, doesn't he?
Let's see that lesbo Susie
Swanson beat him up now.
Wait a minute. How do you know she's gay?
Short haircut, stubby legs, doesn't respond to my advances.
You haven't answered my question!
Why the hell does Stewie look like this?
Well, I took him to the gym and
the colorful gent there advised me that I put him on steroids.
And you listened to him?!
Yeah, I believe everything everyone tells me, anywhere.
What's goin' on B minus?
What's the happs?
Stewie, you look gross.
You look like Lou Ferrigno's poop.
I look like a guy who's been hittin' the gym.
It has nothing to do with the gym. You're on drugs.
Doesn't matter how you find the pot o' gold, B to the rian
All that matters is that you beat the leprechauns.
That doesn't make any sense.
Doesn't have to make sense when you look like this.
Rrrrrr ... !!!
I am hotter than phone sex with a blind girl.
You sound hot.
What are you wearing?
I dunno.
Classic Rock 103.7 WHTT 
I hate this station.
They always make promises they can't deliver.
Playin' the greatest Rock 'n' Roll hits of all time.
We built this city .....
See?
Chris, turn that off.
We have a lot of work to do before we go inside.
Alright, if I'm gonna be seen with you
we have to do something about that look.
Now, take that hat off.
Oh, God. Your hair's all combed.
Here, let me fix that.
Alright, good.
Now, let's give you a pencil thin, douchebag beard.
Oh, heavens, I look like a rake.
No, you look like you don't care, and that's good.
Oh, OK.
Um, if we're dating, does that mean when we go in there
I can hold your hand?
Good idea.
Then everyone will think you're popular.
Well, I don't really care about that.
I want to hold your hand 'cos I like you.
I don't understand
Well, I think you're nice ... and I like spending time with you.
You're really pretty and I hope I get to be with you for a long time.
Wow, um...
No guy's ever said anything that nice to me before.
Well, maybe you've been hanging around with jerks.
Yeah, maybe I have.
Hey, forget the pep rally.
You wanna go see a movie?
Cool! Maybe we could go see that Chazz Palminteri/ Paul Sorvino movie "Distracting Trumpet"
I wanna thank you all for comin' out here today.
We got a serious situation down in the Bronx.
Our friend needs to get a message to the short man in the hat.
He needs to deliver this message before the construction site contracts are handed down.
It's of vital importance that these matters be attended to.
So we may have to bring in our friend from Yonkers!
What?
I said "we may have to bring in our friend from Yonkers!"
Hey, what the hell?
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is there a problem? Huh?
You wanna go?
You wanna go?
- “Go?” What are talkin' about? - I'm talkin' about “go”
That's what I'm talkin' about.
First one's on the house.
I got things to do.
Uh, where you think you're going?
I'm going downstairs.
Oh, there's a toll in the hall now.
10 bucks.
Look, can I ...
Just ....
Stewie ...
Look ...
Come on ...
I ...
Just ...
You ...
This is ...
Can I ...
Ah, just messin' with you, man.
You can do whatever you want.
I was just kiddin' you.
Why're you so serious?
Alright, Chrissy, here we go.
Oooh! Aaaah!
Oh, my God!
Is that Chris Griffin with Connie D'Amico?
I think it is!
Wow, that makes him popular!
Hey, Griffin!
Griff-a!
Griff-a-mano!
Wow, the jocks have never said hello to me before.
Er, hi, you guys.
Wow, you did it, Connie.
Chris Griffin is popular.
So, you gonna dump him now?
No, Gina, I'm not.
- You're not? - No.
There's something about him.
He's not like the other guys.
I actually really like him.
You do?
Yeah. In fact, I'm going to his house for dinner tonight
so I can meet his parents.
Wow, Connie D'Amico's coming to my house for dinner!
I just hope dad doesn't embarrass us,
like he did when that one legged guy came over.
Alright, well, if you like movie trivia,
I got one that'll stump you ...
Aaaaaaah ...
... course, you're probably not really into tibia ... trivia
Aaaaah ... Boy, that global warming, huh?
They say we lost a foot of snow last winter ...
Hey, how 'bout another beer, huh?
I bet you like the taste of hops ... Aaaah ....
You only have one leg, sir.
Oh, Connie, it's so nice to meet you.

We're so excited that Chris is finally bringing a girl home for dinner.
It's really nice to meet you too, Mrs Griffin.
Um, do you mind if I ask what's up with your baby?
I'm gonna go work out.
Again? It's like the eighth time today.
I'm not satisfied until every vein is forced up against my skin.
Look how vascular I am, Brian.
If there's one thing women love, it's a vascular man.
I've got veins. They carry blood all over my bahdy.
That's how John Mayer would say it.
“Bahdy”
I'm really into him now.
You better be OK with it!
Well, to answer your question, Connie,
apparently I'm married to a man
who thinks it's OK to inject an infant with steroids.
Wait, Lois, knock it off for a sec.
Connie, you are really pretty.
I mean, you have filled out something wacky.
Oh. Thanks, Mr Griffin.
I like what you're doin' with your boobs.
Dad!
So, Connie, now that you're dating my brother,
maybe we can hang out, y'know?
Hey, after dinner,
you wanna come up to my room and give each other makeovers?
I don't use makeup, Meg.
Course you don't. You're all natural.
Man, your dad must be proud.
Actually, my dad passed away 4 years ago.
Yeah, yeah, he did.
He sure did.
You gonna shower before dessert?
Greggy! Fitzy!
T-bone! Gagaboo!
Nazi guy!
Griffa!
Hey, we're totally stoked for your party this weekend!
Ho ho. You know it, brother.
It's gonna be awesome.
But keep it on the down low, so the spazoids don't catch wind.
Ha-haaaah!
Agh! Speaking of spazoids ...
Wow, can you believe it, Connie?
You and I are gonna be at the same party this weekend.
Oh, this is so cool!
Hey, what are you wearing, so I make sure I don't wear the same thing.
Um, you're not invited, Meg.
What?
But ... it's at my house.
Uh, Connie, let me handle this.
I'm sorry, Meg. You can't come.
There's an arse to boob ratio that you're way off of.
Hey, Chris! C'mon, let's corner the nerds
and call them gay and make them show us their penises.
Ah ha ha! Won't that be gay of them?
Ha ha. Yeah! That is grotacular!
- Way to go, man. - Awesome, bro.
Man, our boy Chris, partying with the cool kids.
I am a very proud dad right now.
Look at that Connie. So young and lithe.
Look at the shape of that body.
Look at the shape of that body!
That's it, Brian!
That's where one-eyed Willy buried his gold!
Oh, Meg, sweetheart
why don't you just go downstairs and join the party?
I wasn't invited!
I hate Chris! He's such a jerk!
Oh, look, honey, he's just a little confused about who he is right now.
I'm sure, deep down, he still loves his big sister.
I hate my school!
I hate everyone!
I hate my life!
OK, look, Meg, I've been at this for 45 minutes
I don't know what else I can say.
Here's a Sylvia Plath book and a bottle of Ambien.
I'm gonna look the other way,
and whatever happens, happens.
Gina, have you seen Chris?
Yeah, he's over there.
Uh, Chris, what are you doing?!
Getting scraped to death by my zipper.
You bastard!
How the hell can you be cheating on me?
I'm the one who made you popular!
No, Connie, beating up that Jewish kid made me popular.
Come on, girls! Let's go upstairs and make out.
Oh, no, Connie's been hurt!
I guess I should lie on top of her to keep her warm.
What are you lookin' at? It's a cartoon!
Chris, I can't believe you dissed Connie at your party.
That was awesome!
Yeah, I heard about it when I was making that gay nerd spoon with me.
Hey, guys ...
Room for one more?
I don't think so.
- Loser! - Reject!
Everyone's gay but me.
My God, he's practically ruined me.
I've created a monster.
Meg, we've gotta do something.
"We"? Are you kidding?
Do you really think I would help you out
in any way, after everything you've done to me?
What are you talking about?
You see this, Connie?
This is from when you called me "sticky arse cow" in 6th grade.
This one is from when you made a plaster cast of my vagina, freshman year.
You want my help?
You can go #@!% yourself!!
Hey, Meg! Think fast!
Ha-ha! Loser!
Alright, let's do it.
When we're done with him,
he'll be more of an outcast than a seagull at an Adam Sandler movie.
This is my old bicycle that I had from when I was ten.
Sometimes the banana seat hurts my hynie.
Will you shut up?
You shut up, man! It's a comedy!
When I ring the bell, it makes my pants feel funny.
Ring, ring, ring!
Ah, another day of being huge.
Good morning, Guns of Navaro ...
Oh, no!
What's happening?!
I'll tell you what's happening.
Your steroids have worn off.
You're weak like everyone else.
And guess what?
There's a toll in the hall, now.
Stay away from me! Stay away from me!
Stewie, no!
And now ... here's something we hope you'll really like.
Settle down, everyone.
OK, let's get this assembly started.
Is everything set, Meg?
Once Chris gets up there, my friend in the AV department will take care of everything.
OK, Meg, remember our deal.
I do this for you, and I have your permission
to think about you later tonight when I'm in the tub.
Fine, Neil
Awesome! I might even go lefty tonight.
Stranger in the tub.
Before we begin, Chris Griffin has an announcement for the cool kids.
Yeah, hey, guys.
The meeting of the Cool Kids Club will be at 3:15
leaning up against Tim Breckner's SUV in the parking lot.
Would you do me? I'd do me.
I'd do me so hard.
Hey, Chris. What's that? Did you sit on something?
Chris Griffin's a freak!
What a loser!
I'm gay, alright?
Ah, c'mon, it's me!
Griffa!
You don't get to talk like that anymore!
Connie, the person who humiliated you has himself been humiliated.
By the rules of high school,
you are now popular again.
Well, we did it, Connie.
Thanks for your help, Meg.
There no chance we're gonna be friends now, is there?
Absolutely not.
Can I at least think about you in the tub later?
No.
I'm still gonna.
Well, Chris, you must feel ridiculous.
I do, dad.
And Meg, I'm really sorry I was such a douche.
Well, there is a way you can make it up to me.
How?
Tell me what it was like ... being one of them.
It was like basking in the warm glow of a higher intelligence,
and it envelopes you, and allows you to become part of its everlasting glory.
I flew today.



Title: We Love You Conrad

Hey, everybody. Look what came in the mail.
We got invitations to Jillian's wedding.
Jillian's wedding? She's getting married?
Wow, that's great.
Looks like she finally found someone after dating that last loser.
She dated someone after me?
No. See how I set up my own joke? You walked right into it, Brian.
Walk right in. Sit right down. Stewie's gonna make you the fool.
Peter, here's your invite. Chris, Meg, Stewie, and me.
Uhhhh ...... probably one more in there.
No, doesn't look like it. Oh, yeah, here it is.
Brian. Oh, no, wait. It's for B. Ryan.
Ah, cool, Mrs G. Thanks for lettin' me stay here the last couple of weeks.
I've enjoyed his company.
She invited everybody except me?
What the hell? We dated for 6 months.
Ouch! Well, Brian, looks like you're the odd man out.
Like a non-praying mantis.
Bless us, oh Lord, for these gifts we are about to receive.
Help us to be mindful of all our blessings ...
and ...
Brian, I'm filling out my RSVP card ...
and I don't know whether I should get the salmon or the snausages.
They're having snausages?
Yeah, sounds like fun.
Big deal! I couldn't care less about going to that wedding.
Look on the bright side. It frees you up to go to Cleveland's barbeque.
Cleveland's having a barbeque?
Oh, boy, this is really awkward ...
None of this is awkward. I've moved on from Jillian.
I've dated plenty of other girls since her.
- I never do computer dating. - Yeah, me neither.
So .... you're 27?
Well, that picture, y'know, it was posted a couple of years ago.
So ... so you're ... you're a Golden Retriever?
Well, it's a Retriever mix ...
... b ... bra ... doodle.
Wh ... where is that waitress?
Fine! If you're so over her, we should all go out to dinner.
You, me, Jillian and her fiance.
Unless you're uncomfortable.
I would have no problem with that. I'd love to meet the fiance.
Great! And I'm sure Dushawn would love to meet you.
- Dushawn? - Ahh ... his name's Derek.
But look at your face.
We now return to ... "The Hills"
Justin Bobby was supposed to be here, already.
Are you still going out with him?
I guess so.
I hate how he pushes his bangs out of his face with every word he says.
Ummm ...  order me a beer.
I have to find a spot for my motorcycle.
- Hi, guys. - Hi, Jillian.
Oh, hey, Jillian. Congratulations on your upcoming nuptuals.
Oh! Are they showing?
It's a really thin bra.
Peter, I came over to ask you something.
Will you give me away at my wedding?
Wow, sure. That'd be great!
Jillian, don't you want your own father to give you away?
Lois, don't ruin this for me.
Don't ruin this like you ruined Kicks cereal.
Mmmm. This Kicks cereal is good tasting.
And it's good for you.
Naaaah!!!
My father can't give me away 'cause he's dead..
Ha ha ...
Well then, Peter would be happy to do the honours.
Plus, when's the next time you're gonna get to give a bride away?
I know. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
You can give me away when I get married, dad.
N-a-a-a-a-h!
Merci, mademoiselle. And for the gentleman ... ?
Yeah, can I have, ah, this 3rd thing down, please?
Ah, very good,sir. And for you?
ORDERS IN FRENCH 
Ah ha ha ha. Bon. Excellent. Merci, monsieur.
Wow, Derek, that's pretty good French you speak there.
He also speaks 'Orange'.
- Mandarin, honey. - Mandolin.
O-o-o-h ... o-o-o-h!
Hey, hey. What luck, huh?
Wow, sweetie! That was amazing.
Ha, I don't think I could do that again in a million years.
- Ahhhhhhh ... oh ... oh ... oh ... - Aah ... ah ... ah ... ah
I caught ... this piece.
Oh, my God! Sir, are you alright?
Ahhh ... I don't know. I actually just had elbow surgery.
I wasn't even supposed to come in to work today ...
Why would you trip me deliberately?!
I ...I'm ... I'm sorry.
Dinner's goin' great.
You know, I can probably help you with that elbow.
- Does that feel better? - Yeah, it feels a lot better.
Wow, you're the best man ever.
Oh ho ho, hardly.
Excuse me, I'm just gonna use the restroom really quick.
- I'll go with you. - Oh, my God. Gay!
Shutup! He's obviously some sort of Superman. I just ...
... I just need to know if he has any shortcomings that'll make me feel better.
You are not even ... You're goin' in there to look ... That's even gayer.
Oh, come on!
Can I have anoth ... another bourbon, please?
Hey, blondie. You wanna get together with my "Dogwood?"
What?
Dogwood, y'know, like ... like Dogwood and Blondie.
Like in the funnies.
You mean Dagwood?
Dagwood. That's what it is.
Hey, how about this one ...
You wanna take a Wizard on my Id?
Ah, ha ha ha.
You remind me of my step dad.
Oh ... oh, man.
What the hell did I do last night?
Good morning.
Oh, my God! You're Lauren Conrad!
- Yeah. - From "The Hills".
Yeah, you seem surprised.
No, no .. it's just .. I .. I mean .. I probably had a lot to drink last night so
if I did anything that might have offended you, I'm .. I'm sorry.
No, it's OK, I have a dog
so I've had to cut poop out of his fur before.
Oh ... oh, thanks.
Well, otherwise it was a fun night though, right?
So fun.
Y'know, I had a really fun night, Brian.
You seem like a really cool guy.
Yeah, um ... Hey, y'know, if you don't mind ...
I'm sorta a low profile kinda person, so ...
I'm gonna take off before anybody gets the wrong idea here.
Hey ... Brian, is that you? Is that Lauren Con ...?
I was shoppin' for hats ... Hang on! I'm coming over!
Oh, no.
Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
Who's that?
Oh, it's just this jerk that goes to my school.
You go to school?
No, I just lied to you and I'm not really sure why.
Is this the longest light ever, or what?
Ah, there we go!
Oh, my God! How do you two know each other?
Ah, we actually just met.
Well, I'm Stewie.
I'm Lauren, it's good to meet you.
I love the show. Do you need a gay friend on the show .. a friend on the show?
Hey, you know what? I'm actually on my way to go shoot now
if you want, you guys can tag along.
Oh, ah, I don't know if we have time.
Yes, we would love to. Brian, don't wreck this for me.
Oh, my God! I have the perfect hat for this.
Listen, Lauren, I'm not .. not super comfortable being on camera.
Oh, relax. After a little while you'll forget they're even there.
What's everybody looking at? The salesman told me it was unisex.
Hey, those people look familiar.
Ah, that's Heidi and Spencer. I don't really talk to them.
Wow, Spencer does look like a monkey.
Spencer, I am so over your selfishness.
Whatta ya want? I came out to Hollywood, I'm on camera all day
and I turned my back on my own kind.
Uuugh... there's Brody Jenner. God, what a douchebag.
I can't believe that came out of Bruce Jenner's vagina.
Bruce Jenner is a man.
No, Brian. That's what the Press would have you believe. But he's not.
Bruce Jenner is a woman. An elegant, beautiful, Dutch woman.
This is where they edit the show together.
Lauren, we've got a rough cut of next week's episode.
- Can you queue that up, Terry? - Sure.
I need to be, like, fine, to be alone, and, like, not even want to date someone
and then I know I'll be fine to get into a relationship.
That's it? That was like, 5 seconds.
It's OK. They fill the rest with shots of street signs, and fronts of restaurants
and old footage from the A Team.
Hey, Brian, where were you last night, buddy?
Oh, I was .. um .. I was out. I got a little wrecked after dinner
and I didn't wanna drive home.
Oh, yeah? Did you stay in town or did you head for 'The Hills?'
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Wait a minute! How the hell do you guys know about that already?
It's all over the internet. Look!
Does Lauren Conrad have a new beau?
An anonymous source has the answers ..
Oh, yeah, I know that guy. His name's Brian Griffin
and he definitely boned Lauren last night.
Great ... great... That ... that's fantastic.
Well, I think it's wonderful that you're datin' such a classy, well
educated girl like Lauren Conra ... ha ha. She's such an idiot, Brian.
She's such an idiot!
Yeah, you know something, Brian. I bet you make the late night monologues.
I mean, it's a little weird isn't it, this new Lauren Conrad relationship?
When asked about their sex life, Brian was quoted as saying
"Oh, yeah, we just do it "me" style."
Have you seen the news about Lauren Conrad and Brian Griffin?
Y'know, a lot of these young Hollywood girls carry their little dogs around in their purse.
But Lauren carries one in her pants.
Yeah, so Lauren Conrad and Brian Griffin are now a couple.
Apparently she gave that dog a bone and ... he gave it right back!
Look, I was drunk outta my mind, I didn't know what I was doing.
It was a one night thing. I have no interest in dating one of those shallow
idiot celebrities who's only famous for being famous.
I'm going over to let her down easy.
Hey, tell her I like her work in "Jake and the Fatman".
Oh no, wait. That was William Conrad.
Tell her I like "Jake and the Fatman".
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm Brian. I'm, ah, the guy all the comedians have been talking about.
Oh, si! Ha ha ha ha ha. Lauren is in the back.
Just follow the music and you will find her.
Thanks.
- Oh, hi Brian. - Wow! Hi.
- That's beautiful. What was that?
- It's Mozart's violin concerto number 1 in B flat.
Plato's symposium ... this yours?
- Oh, yeah. - It's pretty worn out.
Yeah, I've read it, like, a hundred times.
I find Aristófanes' quasi satirical origin myth
regarding the three genders both fantastic and serious.
Yeah, that .. er .. that always cracked me up.
So, you read a lot, huh?
Yeah, but I try not to let it interfere with my biomolecular research.
Biomolecular? I ... I don't understand.
Come on. I'll show you what I did yesterday.
It'll make you feel ... young, as when the world was new.
- You did all this in a day? - The matrix formed in a day.
The life forms grew later at a substantially accelerated rate.
Can I cook? Or can't I?
This doesn't make any sense. If you're so smart why do you hide it?
Come on, Brian. You know America doesn't like smart people.
They elected Bush twice.
Yeah, once, but .. so this whole persona is just a publicity stunt?
Publicity is what keeps this franchise running, Brian.
We're even using state of the art computer animation to create
a fake sex tape with me and Bill Cosby.
Now, you will get ready for the zim zam and the babbidy bibbedy.
and you will take off your clothes, like vooo and voooom
and get ready for the most splendiferous pudding pop you have ever seen.
Alright, Jillian, since I'm giving you away on your wedding day
I wanna make sure it all goes off without a hitch.
Now, what are your thoughts on a wedding singer?
Oh, I thought that maybe I would just DJ the wedding myself.
I already made a playlist on this.
- A box of Junior Mints? - This isn't an iPod?
- Do Junior Mints play MP3s? - My iPod is chocolate?
Well, be that as it may, or not be that, I was thinkin' I could be your wedding singer.
That's a great idea, Peter!
Sweet! And I promise you'll be able to understand all the words.
Not like Sting where you can only understand the last 3.
... brand new day ..
So, did you break up with  Lauren?
No, I didn't. As a matter of fact, she's coming over for dinner tonight.
Say what?!
Well, Lauren, it's a real pleasure havin' you here for dinner.
Of course, I'm sure this isn't as exciting as your usual cuisine.
Y'know, all that caviar with the little silver spoons
Actually, Mrs Griffin, caviar spoons are carved from bone.
They don't use metal because it reacts chemically with the fish eggs and changes their taste.
Oh, well that's fascinating.
You could have just complimented the free food,
but one upping me is another way to go.
- So, y'know, guys ... - Bitch.
Lauren just finished a fascinating doctoral thesis
on sub-orbital propulsion mechanisms
that NASA is using for the next generation of space shuttles.
Oooohhhhhh ... Aaaaahhhh!
So, Lauren, um, whenever I'm watchin' your show ...
... you give me wood.
Where do we go from here?
Well, I could sign a picture for you.
Uh, yeah, sure, that'd be fine. Thank you.
So, Lauren, do you and Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan
all hang out and go drunk driving together?
I heard that Lindsay Lohan wasn't driving that night.
She was taking the rap for a friend.
Road hog!
Oh, no! I already have 2 strikes.
- I'll take the wheel, Mr Magoo. - I'm too old to go to prison.
They'll rape me! And I'll never see 'em coming, no I won't.
Well, uh, Lauren and I had a great time today at the Art museum.
There was a special exhibition of rare Monet paintings ...
- Manet, honey. - What?
It was actually the Manet exhibit, not Monet ...
But no big deal. People make that mistake all the time.
Oh, right.
Y'know, I don't mean to be rude, but do you have a more comfortable chair?
This one's really hurting my back.
Oh, my God! Quagmire, you come out from under there!
I'm sorry everybody. I just wanted to meet her so bad.
I can't do anything right.
I'll go have a talk with him.
Hey, buddy, where are all your pals?
- Playin' baseball. - Well, why aren't you playin' with 'em?
- 'Cause I don't have a glove. - Oh, yeah?
- Gee! Just for me? No fooling? - Nah, just kidding. It's mine.
- Oh. - Yeah.
Oh, sweetie, dinner with your family was so much fun tonight.
Yeah, I think they really liked you.
It was so cute when you thought Manet was Monet.
Yeah .. yeah .. that .. that was a hoot.
Oh, hey, how are you liking my unabridged history
of 2nd World War naval tactics in the Pacific theatre?
Oh, it's really, um .. interesting ..
I'm at the part where they detail the account
of Admiral Halsey's victory at Midway.
You mean Admiral Spruance, sweetie.
Huh?
Well, Halsey was hospitalized with cirrhosis at the outset of the battle
so Spruance, who prior to June of 1941, was primarily a desk Admiral
was charged with leading the naval fleet at Midway against Japan.
A victory which surprised even his peers.
And in fact, was a turning point for the American naval forces in the Pacific.
No, yeah. That's .. that's the part I'm at.
Oh, my God, you're so cute
when you don't know what you're talking about.
Well, wait a minute. What the hell does that mean?
Are you saying I'm not smart?
You don't have to be. You're adorable. Like those calendars
that have monkeys in clothes.
Look, why don't we talk about this in the morning?
I wanna finish that book.
- Sweetie, since when do you wear reading glasses? - What? These?
- I've had these forever. - Honey, those aren't real.
- Sure they are. - No .. they're not.
I can see the little Austin Powers logo on the side.
What are you talkin' about?  These are my glasses.
Yeah, baby, yeah!
- Alright, I can't do this. - Can't do what?
I can't date someone who's smarter than I am.
I feel like Jillian.
O-o-o-o-o-h-h-h-h ..
- What? What, what, what? What is that?
I think I get it.
This isn't about me being smarter than you.
This is about you still being in love with Jillian.
- How do you know that? - Because I'm smarter than you, Brian.
Oh, my God ...
You're right!
Y'know, I thought I was over her, but .. I'm .. I'm not.
Somewhere along the line she must have gotten under my skin.
I'm in love with her. How could I have been so miopic?
- "Myopic". - Thank you, Lauren!
My God, Lauren. What am I gonna do? I'm still in love with Jillian.
Well, there's only one thing you can do, Brian.
Tell her how you feel.
What's the use? It's over. She's moved on.
Well, who knows? Women are complex creatures, Brian.
Maybe she just needs to be reminded how much she misses you.
And I know exactly how to do that, Brian.
She needs to see you on the arm of a beautiful woman.
- What is this gonna do? - It's gonna make her jealous.
You, out on the town with a hot date.
How are you a hot date?
Whoa! You're angry at her, not me.
No wonder you're alone.
This isn't working at all. She doesn't even know we're here.
Oh, she will, Brian. And she's gonna be upset that your date is so into you.
Ok, ready? I've been reading up on things that
sound sexy. "Oh, Brian, I can't wait
til after dinner
'cause then we'll go home and you can watch me have my period".
What the hell's wrong with you? That's not sexy!
Hey, Brian. I just noticed you over here.
- Hi, I'm Jillian. - Desiree. Charmed!
Well, I wish we could stay. But we have quite an exciting evening planned.
Oh, oh, yeah, right. We're really hittin' the town.
Yes, we're gonna douche the night away.
Uh, well, have fun. You two are a really cute couple.
Hey, Desiree.
Oh ... hey, Lee...
Brian,this is Lee. Lee, this is Brian.
I know Lee from ...
- ... Starbucks. - Hey, is that Desiree?
That's it. I mean, I don't know what else I can do. The wedding's tomorrow
and she hasn't shown any signs of leaving Derek.
- I've completely run out of options. - Not quite, Brian.
- There's still one thing you can do. - What's that?
Go for broke. Just throw all your cards on the table at once.
Show her that you love her in a way she can't possibly ignore.
Hello?
Oh, hey, Lee...
No, it's not a bad time.
Yeah, I still have those boots.
Well, maybe I'll wear 'em and maybe I won't.
And now, Jillian .. Do you take Derek ..
Wait!
Jillian, I'm in love with you.
I want you .. no .. I need you
with all my heart and soul. And my only regret is that I
didn't realize it when we were together.
Those were the happiest days of my life and
I want more of those days. Please, Jillian ...
I love you. Will you please take me back?
Brian, no. You had your chance.
I mean, I thought you were my 'Soul Train' ..
- but you didn't want me. - 'Soul Mate.'
Soul Food? I'm sorry ...
but I'm in love with Derek now.
I see.
- And you really feel that way? - Yeah.
I mean, he's everything I have
especially since my mom died of cancer.
Ha ha ...
Alright, party people. Please clear the dance floor
for the bride and groom's first dance.
And here to sing a romantic ballad is
the one and only Sting.
... fields of gold.
Hey, buck up there, sport.
- At least you gave it your all. - I guess you're right.
- I still feel like crap, though. - Well, look at it this way ...
You may have lost Jillian but
you can at least be happy that she's happy.
- Plus you can always call Lauren. - No, I can't.
Why not?
She's never gonna speak to me again.
I gave her worms.



Title: Peter's Progress

Hey, where's Cleveland?
Doesn't he have a relative in town or something?
I dunno, but I ordered him a beer and now it's just sittin' there
lookin' lonlier than Alan Rickman's answering machine.
Hello. You've reached Alan Rickman
at 0-5-5-5-0-1-2-2.
Please leave a message at the beep.
Hello, Alan Rickman. It's Alan Rickman
reminding you to move the pork chops from the freezer to the refigerator
so they defrost properly.
Do not disappoint me.
Hello. You've reached Alan Rickman
at 0-5-5-5-0-1-2-2.
Please leave a message at the beep.
Alan, it's me again.
Remember that turtle joke for the party.
Hah hah hah hah hah.
Hey, y'all, I want you to meet my cousin from Jamaica,
- Madam Claude. - Nice to meet you all.
Eh heh, you sound like the crab from Little Mermaid.
I had crabs once. It was awful.
You gotta by that cream that comes with the little comb.
- 'Course I can still use the comb. - Well, that's Quagmire.
And you know what else? Madam Claude is psychic.
She can tell you what you were in a past life.
I already know what I was.
A strawberry.
Ah ... it's another pleasant day for me, Peter the Strawberry.
Hey, Mr. Worm. I welcome you arrival
'cos we're all part of the same garden.
Wait ... whadda ya ... uh ... uh... hey .. hey ... hey, get outta here!
Hey, hey! Aaah! Aaaaahhh! Aaaahhhh! Aaaahhhh! Aaaaahhh!
He was my neighbour,
and he violated me.
Now I'll never end up in a fancy pie.
What d'you say, Joe? You want your past life read?
It'll be fun.
Sure, why not?
OK, dear. Close your eyes and clear your mind.
OK. I'm seein' somethin'.
Joe, you were an octopus.
Yes! Yes, this is so awesome!
Damn it!!
Ah, that's so cool! That's so cool! Do me next!
I'm gettin' somethin'.
I see you in London. I think it's the 1800's.
Oh, my! You were Jack the Ripper!
Giggity!
- What about Peter! - Yeah, Peter next.
Oh, I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
You're wrong, Peter. Let us begin.
Oh, my! You were a very important man.
You were Griffin Peterson, the founder of the city of Quahog.
Now wait a second, Cool Runnings. We learned in school
that Miles Chatterbox Musket founded Quahog, after he was saved by the magic clam.
No, that is a myth.
Peter, you were the founder of Quahog.
I see ... I see England a long time ago.
It is a crisp, clear Spring morning,
and Griffin Peterson is ridin' to the home of his beloved.
Peterson, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be down at
your job, making oblong bricks out of manure and straw?
No, we're off. It's Martin Luther Day.
- Ah hah! - Yes, that's a very smart joke.
- Isn't that right, comedy professors? - Mmmmm. Oh, yeah. Well done. Indeed.
- Now, what d'you want? - I wanna marry your daughter.
and I'm here to ask for your blessing.
What could you possibly have to offer my daughter?
Well, I'm one of the few guys in this town
who isn't dying a slow, painful diarrhoea death.
Alright, come on in.
- Knock, Knock. Lady Redbush? - Griffin! It's so good to see you.
I'm so horny. Kiss my hand.
What are you doin' here?
I was just walkin' off the rotted goose anus I had for breakfast
and I thought I'd come by and ask you a little question.
- What's that? - Will you marry me?
Ah! Oh, my God, yes!!
Yes, I will, Griffin. Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
- Did you do it? - I did it.
Ooh yah yah yah oh boy yah yah yah yah ...
But in another part of London there was a man
who was not in such good spirits.
The King of England. Stewart, the turd.
Oh .... I'm so bored. I wish to be entertained.
Where's my troop of actors?
Presenting ... the cast of How I Met Your Mother.
- You told her, I told you I kissed her? - Dude, you broke the bro' code.
- That's not against the bro' code. - Yes it is. Article 15B.
That's the heart of the bro' code, man.
Well, you're right, I guess I did break the bro' code.
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ... whoa ... whoa!
What is this? Are these jokes?
Do people in other castles think this is funny?
Well, yeah. We get a pretty sizeable chunk of Princes 18 to 34.
I think I'd like to delete this from my TIVO.
- Are you sure you want to delete this program? - Yes.
Bring me my mid season replacement fool!
- Hi there. - I want to hear some jokes, fool.
Well, y'know, I don't really tell jokes.
I .. I like to tell stories from my life
and let the humour flow organically from everyday situations.
A-hem.
Yeah, my aunt Frieda was a real card
She always had the most wonderful spirit,
even when her mind started to go.
I remember once, she wrote a letter to my uncle Tom
from whom she'd been divorced for several years.
And in the letter, she'd misspelled his name T-O-M-M.
And I said, "Frieda, you've spelled Tom's name wrong."
"You need to take out one of the M's."
And she said, "Which one?"
Y'know, you're gonna be #@%*!@$ dead in 5 seconds
if aunt Frieda doesn't throw a pie at somebody!
I mean, part of that is you sorta have to know my family ...
Make me laugh!!!
Hey, look .... keys!
Ha ha ha ah ah. Oh, that's so satirical.
Ah ha ha. What social commentary?
Ah ha ha. Well, now I'm in a wonderful humour.
I wish to go for a walk into town.
Hey, coachman. Let's drive on the left side of the road
and see if that catches on.
Good Lord! Who is that?
That's Lady Redbush, and her husband-to-be, Griffin Peterson.
That piece of arse is marrying that tall glass of poop juice?
Well, not if I have anything to say about it.
A woman of that calibre should be married to a King.
- Well, what are you gonna do about him? - I'm the King, jester.
I'm going to have him exiled to the farthest corner of the world.
And then she'll be all mine.
Why is he such a jerk to everybody?
Because he has a very, very small penis.
I've seen it, actually, and .. and it's,
like,  you don't even want to make fun of it,
- y'know ... it's just ... medically fascinating. - I kinda wanna see it.
Yeah, it's like that one grape in the bunch that never got to be a grape.
I wonder what's keepin' Griffin.
Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, sweetie.
Remember, he's tubby. It takes him a while to move around.
I hope he didn't get diarrhoea and die.
- Can I feel those boobs? - No! Daddy, what are you, sick?
Hey, it's a different time!
What a wonderfully exciting day. I'm young, I'm all dressed up,
and I'm on my way to marry the woman I love.
And there's 290 years separating me from the films of Kevin Smith.
Hey, Peterson!
- Who are you? - I'm King Stewart.
- Don't you recognise me from the coins?
Oh, yeah. The one's with your profile.
You know, you look really weird from the side.
Well, that's something we didn't really think out too well
when we started ... but never mind that!!
You're going into exile, Peterson.
I'm shipping you out on the first boat to the new world.
But I'm supposed to get married today.
Oh, yeah? Where you going for your honeymoon?
- That medium sized hill. - Wrong. Seize him!
And King Stewart's cruelty was only just beginning.
Maybe he changed his mind. Maybe he's not comin'.
Ohhhhh, come on now. There, feel better after I just said that?
- Give me one little touch. - No!
I hate this. I .. I .. I hate my life!
- Oh ... the King! - The King is here.
I didn't vote for him.
Your Majesty, this is a real honour. Carter Redbush.
Very glad to meet you.
Hello. Harry McAfee.
As a citizen, I'm proud to have you reign over me
and the McAfee Fertilizer company.
Lady Redbush, I wish I was here on a happier errand.
But I'm afraid I must inform you that Griffin Peterson is dead.
What?!
Now that some time has passed, do you wanna go out?
With Griffin Peterson exiled to the new world 
and Lady Redbush believing he was dead,
King Stewart was now free to marry her.
The bride and groom have written their own vows.
Our love is like two figs hanging from a fig tree,
cradled by Cupid's own hand.
You and I are like t...
Oh ...oh ... I'm sorry.
Is my wedding interrupting your .. your promotion?
We're right in the middle of our show.
OK, right now. You have a time slot. Go there!
Maybe finish this candy bar before you open another one.
Well, at least it wasn't one of those promos where they've got the whole
cast shoving each other playfully,  like they're all good pals.
Oh, oh, look! There we go! Oh, look at 'em jostling each other around.
Oh, they give each other a hard time, but they're friends.
Is that areal show?
No, it's just ... no, it's .. somebody's makin' a joke. Forget it.
Meanwhile, Griffin Peterson and the other exiles passed the time
on the ship to the new world.
Ah, crap! A splinter.
- Well, it's been nice knowin' you guys. - So, what'd you do to get exiled?
I got caught pleasuring myself to a painstakingly
etched engraving of the wife of Bath.
What you do?
Ah, I slept with an underaged virgin
to cure my puff penis.
Hey, fellers. You wanna join me in a game of mumble peg?
- Oh, no thanks. - Fine, I'll play by myself.
.. mumble .. mumble .. mumble .. .. mumble .. mumble .. mumble ..
One - nothing.
Eventually, after many months at sea
Griffen Peterson and his shipmates finally reached the new world.
I declare this land .. Quahog.
This place is nothin' but a wilderness. What're we gonna do?
We're gonna build a new settlement.
We'll have a happy new life, and we'll have equal rights for all.
Except Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Jews, Gays, Women, Muslims ..
Um ... everybody who's not a white man.
And I mean "white" white,
so no Italians, no Polish. Just people from Ireland, England, and Scotland.
But from only certain parts of Scotland and Ireland.
Just full blooded whites.
No, y'know what? Not even whites.
Nobody gets any rights.
Ahhhh ... America.
How's your stewed fox-quail, my dear?
Oh, it's quite good. I'm also enjoyin' the turtled hen.
Isn't the turtled hen good?
So, listen. You and I need to have a conversation
about you not bearing me a son.
Well, my Lord, we've discussed this.
We have to have sex in order for me to bear you a son.
Oh, I know. I've just been so tired, and I've had so much work,
and I think .. I think I wanted to the other day
but I couldn't find you. So, y'know, it's like both of us on our schedules, y'know?
Well, why don't we do it tonight?
Maybe. Tonight might work. Yea...
Oh, no! I got that thing in the morning.
Oh .. how 'bout tomorrow at four?
You know I'm with my mother tomorrow at four.
Oh, darn it! I'm going to be so horny tomorrow at four.
Y'know, I gotta say, I'm a little mad at you for not bein' more available.
We can have sex right now on the table.
Hey! hey, hey, hey ... hey.
We eat here.
Griffin Peterson and the other colonists worked day and night
to build their new settlement, until finally,
after much hard work, the colony of Quahog was complete.
It didn't take long before Quahog was a thriving new world settlement,
bustling with life.
Boy, everything's shapin' up real nice.
Yeah, and we finally finished the town Abortion Clinic.
Time had helped Griffin forget Lady Redbush,
and soon he found himself a hearty new wife.
Boy, that was fantastic.
You must have had a lot of practice.
No, not really. I've been saving myself for marriage.
Ahhhhhh ....... We should probably open up some windows.
I don't know what to do, jester. I can't be married to the King anymore.
My heart still belongs to Griffin Peterson,
but he's dead.
- Ahh. No. He's not. - What?
I was ordered to keep silent by the King, under threat of execution
but .. you're gonna see this anyway.
Oh, my God! He's alive! Jester, I've got to get to him.
I'll help you. But only if I can go with you.
If I stay here, the King'll execute me for telling you all this.
Well .. OK. But how are we gonna get there?
We'll hitch a ride on one of the slave ships tomorrow night,
after an all new Shovin' Buddies.
Followed by an all new slowly rotating black man.
And so Lady Redbush sailed off to the new world.
to find her beloved.
And the timin' was good, because his new wife was a pain in him arse.
.. and then I finished scrubbing the kettle
but .. then I saw that I'd missed a spot
and, oh .. I was so worried that the whole thing wasn't clean enough
so I went back and started washing it again, and sure enough ...
.. I'd missed another spot, and there was a clump of cornmeal
- under the rim from when I made breakfast. - Shut up, Meg! I prithee, shut up!
Griffen!
Lady Redbush.
And so, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush were happily reunited.
Of course, Griffin had to go through the complex, extensive divorce
procedure required by 18th century society.
Gone! What do you mean she's gone?
Sire, Lady Redbush has been gone these 6 months.
- 6 months? - Yes. Forgive me, Sire, but how could you not be aware of this?
Don't you share a bed chamber with her?
Well, I mean, sometimes we .. we.. we sleep .. we.. we go to different ..
er, we go to bed at.. at different times. We've both been so busy ...
it's been .. rediculous! I .. I thought she was takin' a class or something.
Oh, man, that sucks! Because I'm so horny.
Damn it! Oh, I wanted to do sex to her tonight.
Well then, I guess we've gotta go get her.
Yeah .. alright.
Months rolled by, and Griffin and Lady Redbush continued to
flourish happily in the colony of Quahog,
completely unaware that King Stewart was on the march.
There was a peaceful town called Quahog
Where people lived in harmony 
They never had no kind of trouble
There was no hint of misery.
Then all at once the trouble started
A pack of murderers and thieves
Like swarms of locusts they descended 
Their aim to make the townfolk flee
They've gotta be here somewhere.
Where's my 1st lieutenant?
Here I am, sir. Yessir, right indeed, here indeed, yes I am, sir.
I want you to turn this settlement upside down until
you find Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson.
That fat bastard thinks he can steal my bride and get away with it
I wouldn't bet a corn farthing on him escaping.
No, I wouldn't. Not a corn farthing would I bet. No sir.
- What's wrong with you? - Little wrong in the head, I am,
from eatin' some bad sausages. Yes, bad sausages that I eat, indeed, sir.
Yes, I did some bad sausages ate I.
Oh, Griffin, this time together has been the happiest of my life.
Me too, Lady Redbush.
All those months I was without you, I never stopped
seein' your face in the back of my wife's head.
And all those months I was sailin' for the new world
I saw your face in every slave's stomach.
Tell me we'll be together forever.
We will.
I found 'em, your Majesty. Indeed, yes I did found 'em, did I
- did, yessir, I did. - Yeah. OK, OK ... whatever.
Alright, Peterson. Two things are gonna happen here:
I'm gonna take my wife back, and then I'm gonna kill you!
Alright, alright, Mr. King, sir. You win.
I'm sorry, Lady Redbush. But he is your husband.
Let me just, uh, walk over here and get your things for you.
Nyaah-ahhhhh!
Alright, your Majesty. If you wanna leave with your pal in
one piece, I suggest you throw down your weapons.
Go ahead and kill him, Griffin. You kill him, and I'll kill her.
Go ahead. You kill her, I'll kill him.
Go ahead. You kill him, I'll kill her.
Knock yourself out. You kill her, I'll kill him.
Ha ha ha. This is me laughing. You kill him, I'll kill her.
Ha ha ha. This is me before Ultra Slim-Fast.
You kill her, I'll kill him.
Wait! Wait! There's gotta be a better way to settle this.
- Talent show? - Talent show!
Hear ye! Hear ye! This talent competition will decide rightful possession of
the good Lady Redbush and control of the colony of Quahog.
We first present King Stewart of England with some observational humour.
Hi, there, everybody.
You know, my aunt Frieda was a real card.
She always had the most wonderful spirit,
even when her mind started to go.
What the !*$#@?
I remember once, she wrote a letter to my uncle Tom
from whom she'd been divorced for several years.
And in the letter, she'd misspelled his name T-O-M-M.
This .. this is my bit. These .. these are all my bits.
Ssshh. This is funny.
Unbelievable.
And I said, "Frieda, you've spelled Tom's name wrong."
"You need to take out one of the M's."
And she said, "Which one?"
Clap your hands, everybody.
And everybody clap your hands.
We are the Quahog colonists
- and Mort the Jew. - Hey there.
We're out here on stage tonight
to do a show for you
We got Peterson on the violin
and Quagmire and Joe will be joinin' in
We got Stumpy Shamus on the lead guitar
and he's gonna give you a great big ...
Aaaaaaarrrrrrrrr! Break!
Oh, God. They put so much work into theirs.
I .. I didn't know we could rip off movies.
And from then on, Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson
lived in peace and happiness.
- Oh, Griffen, I love you. - And I, you.
Let's grow old into our 30's together.
I wanna have a baby with you.
And I wanna be there there when you die, giving birth to it.
And so ends the tale of Griffin Peterson and the founding of Quahog.
Well, what a bunch of delightfully colorful characters.
- So, was that it? - That's it.
Now stay tuned for an all new Cross Armed Opposites.
- This guy. - No. This guy.
- No. This guy. - No. This guy.
Both of us.
Ah ha ha ha ha ha. Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .... ahhhhhh.

Title: Three Kings

Hi, it's me, Peter, your TV cartoon pal.
Y'know, Lois has bitchin' lately
that I watch too much TV and don't read enough books.
So I went to the library and picked up three books
by the greatest author of the last thousand years.
Stephen King.
And tonight I'd like to share them with you.
We begin with a little tale called "Stand by Me"
about 4 young boys who went looking for a dead body
and instead found ..... themselves.
... and also a dead body.
The year was 1955
and the voice in my head was that of Richard Dreyfuss.
I never had friends like the ones I had when I was 12.
There was me, Petey Lachance
Anyone else fed up with this over-saturation of media?
Three channels, and still nothin' on.
Then there was Joey Duchamp
The voice in his head was Roy Scheider.
How are you, Richard?
Fine, Roy, how are you?
Good, good.
We should grab a drink sometime and catch up.
Maybe reminisce about "Jaws".
Great, you should give me a call sometime.
My number's 555 ...
Wait, wait. What?
555?
Er ... yeah.
You know what, Richard?
If you don't want to have drinks, just say so.
You don't have to be a dick about it.
Oh, please!
Make the voices stop!
And then there was Quag Chambers.
He was the leader of our gang.
He had sex when he was five
and committed his first rape when he was ten.
Rape, of course,
being legal in the 50's.
Ha ha. Beat those cards, fellows!
Ha ha ha.
Giggity, giggity, 50's, giggity
Hey, you guys ...
Finally, there was Cleve Brown 
my pudgy black friend.
I can still see him now 
all pudgy and black.
Cleve, please, we're busy lookin' at Playboy.
Look at the way these women starve themselves.
This one can't be more that 180 pounds.
This is way better than Playboy.
Do you guys wanna see a dead body?
Cleve, it's 1955.
Please re-enter the clubhouse in a more stereotypically animated fashion.
Lord a'mighty! I done seen me
a dead body down by the lake!
Sho' nuff, I thought I'd go deef and dumb
when I saw me that dead body!
Cleve, calm down!
You're not making any sense!
Anything was possible as we set out that day 
except contracting AIDS
because AIDS had not yet been invented by the government
in an effort to eradicate the homosexual community.
Have Gun, Will Travel, reads the card of a man 
A knight without armour in a savage land 
OK, I got another one.
- Show me that smile again - Ooh, show me that smile
Don't waste another minute on your cryin' ...
We decided to cut through old man Pressman's junkyard.
Even though legend had it, that any kid caught scaling the fence
ran the risk of being attacked by the old man's dog.
who would charge to the cry of "Chopper, sick balls"
I got a bad felling about this.
Hey!
What are you kids doin'?
Oh no, it's him!
That's right!
Old man Pressman.
I own the junkyard.
I'm cranky 'cos all my stuff is junk.
Why can't I have nice things?
Chopper, sic 'em!
Sic 'em, boy!
Now, he said "sic 'em, boy",
but what I heard was
"Chopper, talk to disfigured World War 2 veterans
who aren't as bitter as they should be."
Glad I could do my part.
I think you may have done too much.
Hey, how about this brand new thing called rock'n'roll?
Even though it was just invented,
we already remember it fondly.
Here's Little Richard with "Piano Riff Woooo"
My arse!
Man, this trip is dangerous.
Couldn't we have just taken a bus?
..... black guy.
Uh, guys, anyone know when the next train is scheduled?
Don't worry. If a train comes I'll warn you in slow motion.
T-r-a-i-n!
Aaaaaaahhhh!!!
Aaaaahhh! Aaaaahhh! My legs!
A-n-o-t-h-e-r     t-r-a-i-n!
Aaaaaaahhhh!!! Aaaaaaahhhh!!! Aaaaaaahhhh!!!
What an odd, clustered train schedule!
Hey, sorry you paralyzed, Joey.
Ah, it's alright.
Thanks for goin' all the way back
to the junkyard to get me this wheelchair.
Boy, was old man Pressman angry.
O-o-o-o-o-h-h-h-h-h!!!
Well, there it is.
None of us could breathe.
The twisted and mangled body
we had come to see
was far more disgusting
than any of us could 
ever have imagined.
He's nasty.
Out of my way, you little pipsqueaks!
I'm taking credit for finding this body.
It was the meanest guy in town.
Ace, and his whole gang.
Beast-man, Mer-man, and for some reason, Norm from "Cheers."
Hey, gang.
What, are we beatin' somebody up?
Now, get lost!
We'll take it from here.
Kiss my grits,
you cheap dime store hood.
This ain't over, Lachance.
I mean, you have a gun right now, but tomorrow
I'll get a gun and come to your house and kill you.
Oh .... yeah, I guess you could do that, huh?
I mean, we live in the same town.
And I just can't be on my guard for the rest of my life.
Boy, that is a major hole in this story.
OK, take the body.
We never forgot that wonderful summer,
and eventually, we all went our seperate ways.
Joey learned to live without the use of his legs,
and even went on to create a wheelchair type rugby game
called "Don't-feel-sorry-for-us-ball"
Cleve grew up and went on to marry Rebecca Romjin.
Actually, I'm not even joking about that.
The fat kid from "Stand by Me" is now married to Rebecca Romjin.
Can you believe that?
I swear to God!
Look it up on the internet!
Doesn't that piss you off? 
Quag grew up to become a famous Hollywood actor.
Unfortunately, about a week ago,
he took an overdose of designer drugs at the Viper Room.
He died on the kerb outside.
And now, we're left with a hair lipped reminder 
of what might have been.
Hi. Welcome back from commercials.
Joaquin Phoenix, if you're still watching,
you are a good sport and a trooper.
And you passed our test,
and you can be our friend.
And now for a segment we like a little less than the first and the last ...
Here's "Misery."
Marcia, I've done it!
I've finished the book and Snuggly Jeff is dead
and the readers are just gonna love it.
Paul, I still wish I could talk you out of this.
Snuggly Jeff is the most succesful children's book series ever.
Yeah, but I wanna get into writing more serious stuff.
Y'know, something where the reader doesn't have a load in his pants while he's lookin' at it.
Well, we'll talk about it when you get back.
This just in ...
The Weather Service has reported a big snow storm on its way.
Oh, my God!
Stephen King!
Aaaaahhhh!!!
Hey, this'd make a neat story!
Done!
I'm your number one fan.
I'm your number one fan.
I'm your number one fan.
O-o-o-o-o-h-h-h ...
Who ... wh-who are you?
I'm Stewie Wilkes.
I saved your life.
You were in a terrible car accident
and you broke both your legs.
I taste lipstick!
Am I wearing lipstick?
Not any more.
Um, Paul, quick question, and feel free to say no,
but I couldn't help but notice the new Snuggly Jeff manuscript
in your bag, and, I was wondering if I could read it
then kill you if I hate it?
Well, I guess that'd be OK.
Oh, thankyou, thankyou, thankyou!
Can I read it while I touch your ear and suck my thumb?
Uh, I guess.
Oh, goody, goody!
Stewie?
I just finished the book, you dirty birdy!
How could you?
He can't be dead!
Snuggly Jeff cannot be dead!
Aaaaaarrrr!!
Look, Stewie, I've gone as far as I can with Snuggly Jeff,
and I .. I wanna write something more serious
Well, you are gonna write Snuggly Jeff back to life, Mr. Man.
Look, Stewie, first of all,
you're insane.
And second of all, I have to be inspired before I write.
Well, how 'bout a little TV?
We now return to Magnum B.M.
Magnum, I've found a fingerprint
smudge at the crime scene.
Do you have poo on your hands?
A little.
No, no, no!
This won't do, Paul.
You can't just have Snuggly Jeff
magically brought back to life
by a child's wish.
It's insulting to the reader!
What do you mean?
Well, it's just bad story telling.
Let's see ... How can I explain this to you?
Did you ever see the movie Contact?
Yeah.
So, like, they spent a trillion dollars building this mile high space machine
and Jake Busey blows it up.
So, now they're all like:
"Oh, no. We can't use the space machine"
But then this other guy's like:
"Hey, it just so happens,
"I built another identical trillion dollar space machine
at my own expense, on the other side of the world"
And we're supposed to believe
no-one noticed that?
Well, I stood up in the theatre and I said:
"No! You can't go into space
because the machine already got blown up
by Jake Cock-a-Doody Busey!"
Start over!
Fine. But you're gonna have to go into town
and get me some more paper.
I'm all out.
Uh, I don't know, Paul
Let me see if I can get the Big Wheels started.
Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.
Oh, I don't know, Paul. It's not starting.
Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.
Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna flood it.
Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.. Vrooooom!
Vrooooom! Vrooooom!
OK. I got it now.
I'll see you in a bit.
Heh heh. He's too big for that car.
Mr. Sheldon?
Oh, my God! I'm saved!
Let's get outta here before Stewie gets back!
Ah! My legs!
Now I'm gonna have to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair!
No you're not.
Well, that's it, Stewie.
The book is done.
Can I go now?
Oh, no, Paul. I'm not stupid.
If I let you go, you'll just run straight to the police
and tell them I kidnapped you and held you hostage
and fondled you while you were asleep.
No, I ...wait ...What?
You'll tell them that while you were sleeping
I did things to you that you don't remember.
You .. fondled me while I was asleep?
Yeah.
I don't think I like that.
Well, it's done.
Everybody still awake?
Alright. Big finish.
Now, you remember that Stephen King story
when the guy went up to the empty hotel
and there were those creepy twins
and a guy was runnin' around with that axe
and a kid talked to his finger?
Ah ha, can't you see Stewie doin' that?
Well, here's "The Shawshank Redemption"
The first time I laid eyes on Andy Dufresne
I didn't think much of him.
He was a fat drink of water,
the kind of drink of water that y'know your friend
got from the bathroom and not from the kitchen.
5 packs of cigarettes says the fat one breaks first tonight.
You're on. I'll take the Don Martin looking one.
A month went by before Andy said 2 words to somebody.
As it turned out, that somebody was me.
Vagina, boob.
Later, Andy came back with more than 2 words.
I understand you're a man who knows how to get things.
I've been known to procure various and sundry items.
I .. I .. I don't understand what you just said.
I need stuff.
Can you get it?
What do you need?
I need a rock hammer.
What's it for?
I carve Star Wars figurines outta stone
but it's also for not tunneling my way outta here.
Wow. Can you carve me a set of
women's private parts out of stone?
Sure.
Or you could just have sex with Helen Hunt.
- Ah ha ha ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha ha haa!
Ah, we've only had one conversation
but I can tell we're gonna be life long friends.
And since you're black and I'm white
that makes it more especial for the audience.
Inspection!
You Andy Dufresne?
A little bit. You?
Ah ha ha ha ha!
I'm just tweakin' your bum.
What can I do for you?
I understand you make Star Wars figurines.
Oh, Grievous! Wicked!
Well, anyway, I'm a pretty corrupt guy
so I figured I could sell your figurines and pocket the cash.
What d'ya say?
I don't know ...
Oh, come on!
I'll even cripple that guy who rapes you in the shower.
But I like that guy.
Too late!
Ah, my legs!
Two things never happened again
after that.
Boggs never walked again,
and Andy's farts
never made a sound again.
Thanks to the Star Wars figurines Andy carved,
he landed a cushy job cleanin' the warden's office.
OK, you clean up the warden's office
while I go pop out a pine cone.
Plays "Hollaback Girl" by Gwen Stefani
To this day, I have no idea what
that woman was singin' about.
Like, literally, no idea.
I don't know what a hollaback girl is.
But I have to imagine
it's a foul disease ridden thing
that wears too much makeup
to cover up the fact that it's a 47 year old fish dog.
Andy, I think you know why I've called you in here today.
A prison is an environment which requires
the highest level of discipline ...
and that little stunt you pulled today
.. that little stunt you pulled today
made a lot of people look very foolish.
Look, warden .. we got it rough in here
I just thought we could use a little music.
Music is expressly forbidden inside prison walls!
My God! How can you be so obtuse?
What did you call me?
Obtuse. You're bein' obtuse.
Two months in the hole!
Or am I being obtuse?
Nope, now you're bein' acute.
That time in the hole changed ol' Andy.
I'm gettin' outta here tonight, Red.
I'm gonna take the poop pipe to the crap swamp.
Wow. Where you headed once you get out?
Zihuatanejo.
Sounds fancy.
Eh, actually, it's a filthy Mexican village.
Listen, Red
when you get outta here,
I want you to do somethin' for me.
Up in a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, under an old oak tree,
there's a rock that has no earthly business bein' there.
Under that rock is a box with somethin' I want you to have.
Course, now that I think about it, I've been in her 25 years
All these landmarks are based on possibly outdated observations.
That whole area could be a Wal-Mart by now.
If it is, pick yourself up some nice cheap pants
and good life to you.
Inspection!
Dufresne? Dufresne!
Dufresne, you better get your arse out here before
here before you make me cut this sentence shor ....
Where is he? Where the hell is Dufresne?
I don't know, Sir.
I want him found ... now.
Not after breakfast
Not after C.S.I.
Now!
God, I'm so angry
I could just throw a rock at that poster of David Cassidy.
What the warden and his boys didn't realise was
that Andy Dufresne had escaped from Shawshank Prison
the night before.
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards of foulness
I can't even imagine.
Andy Dufresne,
the man who crawled through a river of poop
and came out clean on the other side.
Why he chose enchilada night,
I will never know.
Do you believe, in your best judgement,
that you have been rehabilitated?
Rehabilitated?
It's just a stupid made up word
so boys like you can sit behind a desk,
wear a fancy suit, and feel important.
You're a jerk! And I had sex with your mother last night!
And I swear to God, you let me out of here,
first thing I'm gonna do is kill again.
When I got outta Shawshank,
there was only one thing on my mind.
A promise I made to a friend that I had to keep.
Walk along the stone wall until you reach the tree,
and that's where you'll find the rock.
Dear Red,
If you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to go a little further.
You remember the name of the town in Mexico, right?
Crap!
What? Oh! Oh, is that him?
Is that..? No, no, beach dog.
Oh! Oh! Is that Red?
Is it? No, no. Not him either.
Where the hell is that jagoff? There's like 1200 bucks in that box.
Oh, my God, if he ran off with that ...
Oh, I am gonna be so pissed!
And what am I gonna do? Go to the authorities?
I just broke out of prison.
Now, what? I gotta spend the rest of my life here by myself?
Well, at least I won't have to be self conscious about my farting.
Well, that's our show.
Thank you, Stephen King.
We'll see you in court.
Now stay tuned for whatever FOX
is limpin' to the barn with.
